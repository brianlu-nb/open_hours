Watching a scary movie with blood and gore can make some people\u2019s skin crawl, but for others, even the possibility of real-life exposure to blood is a problem. The sight of blood or a needle, or sometimes even just hearing a story about it, can make these people pass out. We see this phenomenon illustrated in movies and television shows all the time, such as when a woman goes into labor and her husband is of no help and just faints to the floor.\n2. In about a sixth of cases an underlying heart condition is to blame. But in everyone else, including those who faint when they see blood, the temporary loss of consciousness is due to a problem controlling blood pressure. It means the brain doesn't get enough blood and you collapse to the ground.\n3. Psychologists don\u2019t know exactly why up to 15% of us experience the plunge in blood pressure that causes us to faint whenever we see blood. One theory is that the phenomenon -- officially termed \u201cblood-injury phobia\u201d -- is an evolutionary mechanism.\n4. \"We do clinically find that when people faint at the sight of blood, usually it's their own blood or blood from someone they care about. Often when people describe it, it's the child rushing in gushing blood or they're shocked that they've cut themselves with a knife and there's that whole emotional response.\"\n5. Know the symptoms that precede fainting\u2014feeling light-headed, tunnel vision, nausea, and sweaty or clammy skin. Once you feel those sensations, do your best to lie down promptly, said Dr. Chinitz. \"When you're standing up, you're most vulnerable to that drop in blood pressure, which would lower [blood flow] to the brain and cause you to pass out,\" he says.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The process of \u201cdenaturing\u201d happens when the shape and structure of your protein\u2019s amino acids begin to change. But this is the same for any protein source\u2014eggs, fish, chicken, etc. Your body is still absorbing the same amount of protein, whether you\u2019re eating it cooked or not.\n2. When I accidentally microwaved protein powder once, I saw all the powder clump up which is sign of denaturing but how come cooking chicken won't denature those proteins and our bodies can still absorb it.\n3. And cooking chicken does denature some proteins. The gooey white stuff you see on chicken breasts sometimes when you cook them is mostly coagulated proteins.\n4. Cooking does denature the proteins in chicken. That's why raw chicken changes from squishy, pink, and translucent to firm, white, and opaque when cooked.\n5. How do the proteins from foods, denatured or not, get processed into amino acids that cells can use to make new proteins? When you eat food the body\u2019s digestive system breaks down the protein into the individual amino acids, which are absorbed and used by cells to build other proteins and a few other macromolecules, such as DNA. We previously discussed the general process of food digestion, let\u2019s follow the specific path that proteins take down the gastrointestinal tract and into the circulatory system (Figure 6.7 \u201cDigestion and Absorption of Protein\u201d). Eggs are a good dietary source of protein and will be used as our example to describe the path of proteins in the processes of digestion and absorption. One egg, whether raw, hard-boiled, scrambled, or fried, supplies about six grams of protein.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. There are two important terms to explain how wireless electricity works in, for example, an electric toothbrush, it works by \"inductive coupling\" and \"electromagnetism\". According to the Wireless Power Consortium, \"Wireless charging, also known as inductive charging, is based on a few simple principles. The technology requires two coils: a transmitter and a receiver. An alternating current is passed through the transmitter coil, generating a magnetic field. This, in turn, induces a voltage in the receiver coil; this can be used to power a mobile device or charge a battery.\"\n2. Wireless electricity works in this way: the transmitter converts AC into a magnetic field. The device picks up the field and converts it back to AC. Sounds fairly simple, but there's a reason it took over a century to become viable. The sticking point has been something called magnetic resonance energy transfer. Without this phenomenon, wireless electricity won't transmit far enough to be useful. This is how it works: All magnetic fields vibrate at a resonant frequency. If two nearby fields have the same resonant frequency, the transfer energy vary efficiently over long distances. This is how an opera singer, for example, can shatter a glass with just her voice.\n3. Wireless electricity is quite literally the transmission of electrical energy without wires. People often compare the wireless transmission of electrical energy as being similar to the wireless transmission of information, for example, radio, cell phones, or wi-fi internet. The major difference is that with radio or microwave transmissions, the technology focuses on recovering just the information, and not all the energy that you originally transmitted. When working with the transport of energy you want to be as efficient as possible, near or at 100 percent.\n4. - Howstuffworks \"How Wireless Power Works\" \u2013 describes near-range and mid-range wireless power transmission using induction and radiation techniques.\n5. Wireless electricity is a relatively new area of technology but one that is rapidly being developed. You may already be using the technology without being aware of it, for example, a cordless electric toothbrush which recharges in a cradle or the new charger pads that you can use to charge your cell phone. However, both of those examples while technically wireless do not involve any significant amount of distance, the toothbrush sits in the charging cradle and the cell phone lies on the charging pad. Developing methods of efficiently and safely transmitting energy at a distance has been the challenge.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

In a previous episode we hinted that every spot is at the center of the Universe. But why? It turns out, every way you look at it, you\u2019re standing dead center at the middle of everything. And so is everyone else.\n2. This is a complex question with an even more complex answer. But essentially there is no center of the universe according to current observations. If a center point were to exist, it would need to significant and special in a way that meant it was special to the whole universe collectively. So, this answer will contemplate the different ways that a center of the universe could potentially be created.\n3. This has hints of pedantry and it\u2019s a little unsatisfying, so let\u2019s dig a little deeper. Where is the actual center of the Universe, regardless of who\u2019s observing it? Our Universe might be finite or it might be infinite. Astronomers don\u2019t actually know for sure. Their most precise calculations say that the observable Universe is 93 billion light years across.\n4. There is no 'center' to the universe. At any point, a local observer will claim that they are at the center of the universe by the way galaxies move away from them. How can we possibly know this? The universe appears to be both homogeneous (has the same structure everywhere) and isotropic (there is no preferred direction). If these are indeed properties of the universe, then the expansion of the universe must be the same at all other locations (See: The cosmological principle).\n5. - The universe is incredibly vast, but where exactly is the center?

I have the impression that astronomy is a subject that runs parallel to physics but it is outside the physics field. This is based on the division of departments present in many universities: the department of physics being separated from the department of astronomy. The difference between cosmology and astrophysics is more obscure to me. I have the impression, though, that cosmology is more concerned with the structure of spacetime and universe models while astrophysics is more concerned with stellar life cycles, physical properties of stars, galaxies etc.\n2. Cosmology is a sub-field of Astrophysics, while Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the universe, Cosmology studies universe as a whole.\n3. Cosmology studies universe as a whole and its phenomena at largest scales. The difference between Astrophysics and Cosmology is that Cosmology studies universe as a whole and its phenomena at largest scales.\n4. The easiest to decode is that Cosmology studies universe as a whole and its phenomena at largest scales unlike Astronomy/Astrophysics, which study individual objects. And then, Astronomy is primarily concerned with observing and measuring the relative positions and paths than giving explanations. On the other hand, Astrophysics and Cosmology try to explain the phenomenon observed.\n5. Let\u2019s start with astronomy. This is probably the broadest of the disciplines, as in many ways it is the umbrella term that includes the others. Astrophysics is fundamentally astronomical, whilst cosmology combines astronomical knowledge of our solar system, our galaxy, and our universe with philosophy.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This will probably not be enough to save a whole subspecies, so the team is also using stem cell and cloning technology to try to make pure northern white rhinos. They pulled embryonic stem cells \u2014 the body's master cells, from four of the blastocysts.\n2. The stem cell technique, which has nothing to do with cloning, has already been used in Japan to create live mice. Rhinos are much less studied than mice \u2014 but Jeanne Loring, director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine at the Scripps Research Institute, has already turned northern white rhino cell cultures into pluripotent stem cells. Her lab even turned those stem cells into nerve cells and beating heart cells in a petri dish, she says. So she\u2019s confident she\u2019ll be able to make sperm and eggs, too. \u201cIt\u2019s just another cell type, so we don\u2019t consider it to be an overwhelming challenge,\u201d Loring says. \u201cWe do have to go about it with a lot of trial and error.\u201d\n3. For many of the scientists involved in the project, it\u2019s a matter of responsibility. Northern white rhinos are almost extinct because humans poached them to death, so it\u2019s up to us to fix our mistakes. \u201cThe northern white rhino is emblematic of our times, about the impact of humans on wildlife,\u201d Ryder says. \u201cThat would be the most dramatic kind of statement for what we could do in our time to reverse something that otherwise looks like a pretty sad commentary on our species.\u201d\n4. In 2015, Ryder, Stejskal, and others met in Vienna, Austria, and put together a plan to use the genetic material and sperm taken from northern whites to reverse extinction. The plan involves a few options, with techniques that have been proven to work in humans and other animals, like mice, but not in rhinos. \u201cThere might be obstacles that could prove too difficult,\u201d Stejskal says. \u201cIn the case of the rhino, you don\u2019t do it because you\u2019re sure that you will succeed, but you do it because you feel it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n5.

Retrieved 18 April 2022.\n2. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the September 11, 2001 attacks. If terrorist groups could sufficiently damage safety systems to cause a core meltdown at a nuclear power plant, and/or sufficiently damage spent fuel pools, such an attack could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The Federation of American Scientists have said that if nuclear power use is to expand significantly, nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community. New reactor designs have features of passive nuclear safety, which may help. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission carries out \"Force on Force\" exercises at all nuclear power plant sites at least once every three years.\n3. During the Cold War, Russian experts called nuclear power plants \u201ca nuclear bomb on enemy territory.\u201d Conventional weapons, when used to strike nuclear power plants, can have the properties of nuclear weapons (and have a significantly greater negative impact on the environment.) This led to the possibility of considering nuclear power plants and peaceful nuclear facilities as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and to consider a strike on them as a \u201cpassive form\u201d of employing WMD.\n4. The vulnerability of nuclear plants to deliberate attack is of concern in the area of nuclear safety and security. Nuclear power plants, civilian research reactors, certain naval fuel facilities, uranium enrichment plants, fuel fabrication plants, and even potentially uranium mines are vulnerable to attacks which could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The attack threat is of several general types: commando-like ground-based attacks on equipment which if disabled could lead to a reactor core meltdown or widespread dispersal of radioactivity; and external attacks such as an aircraft crash into a reactor complex, or cyber attacks.\n5. The question of nuclear power plant vulnerability in an attack by a hostile state has not been widely considered, because it was unofficially recognized that it was impossible to protect such facilities from a missile or air strike. That is, it was recognized that it was irrational to conduct military engagements on a territory where there is a nuclear power plant. The benefits from the destruction of the nuclear facility as a strategic, energy, and economic facility were offset by direct and indirect collateral damage.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

It's based on a logarithmic scale, which is some complicated math you don't really need to know to understand the system. Think about it like this: if you leave hand sanitizer on your hands for 3 seconds, it kills 90% of the germs on your hands. If you leave it for another 3 seconds, it will kill 90% of what's left, for a total of 99% killed. If you leave it in place for yet another 3 seconds, it kills another 9%, for 99.9%. This is why hand sanitizer instructions have you rubbing the gel all over your hands for 15+ seconds, to make sure it kills as much as it can.\n2. So why do hand sanitizers and other cleansers say they only kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria? There are a few different reasons for this.\n3. The second reason why products say they only kill 99.9% of germs is marketing and legal liability. If a company claims that they can kill 100% of germs, and someone with an electron microscope decides to put that to the test and discovers germs on the cleansed surface, the company could be liable for false advertising.\n4. So, yes. A product that kills \"only\" 99.9% of germs is perfectly acceptable. You need to use it properly \u2013 that is, long enough for it to work \u2013 and you should still keep up with washing your hands whenever you get the chance, but there's nothing wrong with a product that kills 99.9% of germs. To fully protect yourself, you need to take every precaution you can, though. That means hand sanitizer when you can't wash your hands with soap and water (when you can, making sure to use a full 20+ second washing procedure), wearing a mask whenever you go out, and isolating yourself as much as possible.\n5. Therefore, a sanitizer cannot make the claim that it kills 100% of germs on a surface because it can't. Even the advanced formula hand sanitizers that have alcohol, soap, and other cleansers all worked into it, are not robust enough to kill everything.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Basically, dicks can smell like fish because they\u2019re attached to a human body, and human bodies sweat. Notably, sweat is one of the common reasons for similar vaginal odors. However, among penises, it\u2019s more typical for those who are uncircumcised. Regardless of your genitalia (or foreskin status), if sweating is the cause, a shower with mild soap ought to do the trick.\n2. People with vaginas are always the ones subject to jokes about their nether regions smelling like fish. I wouldn\u2019t care, if it weren\u2019t dictated almost entirely by misogyny. Because guess what losers? Dicks can smell like fish, too! More than that, they can smell like fish for the exact same reasons a vagina might.\n3. - Bacterial infections. A wide variety of bacterial infections can lead to fishy penis odor. These infections are often shared between a man and his partner, so if she winds up with some sort of unpleasant infection, he is likely to have it too. They can also pass the infection between the two of them, so it is important for both to be treated, even if one partner has no symptoms.\n4. The fishy smell is almost certainly being caused by some sort of bacteria, but you need to go and be tested immediately to rule out a sexually transmitted infection (STI). If it\u2019s not an STI, you need to get more details on what it is.\n5.

Raising the Minimum Wage Would Boost an Economic Recovery\u2014and Reduce Taxpayer Subsidization of Low-Wage Work\n3. It has been argued that a second, less obvious, advantage to raising the minimum wage is increased employee morale. Not only will happier employees lead to a more cohesive, productive workforce, but also could result in higher levels of customer satisfaction. Additionally, if employees are satisfied with their job and their pay, they are less likely to leave, which in turn reduces the employer\u2019s hiring and training costs.\n4. Raising the minimum wage could have immediate effects on the lives of low-wage hourly workers by helping them to move out of poverty and keep up with inflation. Some economists argue that other pros of raising the minimum wage could include increased consumer spending, reduced government assistance (and increased tax revenue), and stronger employee retention and morale.\n5. If you look beyond the rising labor costs that a higher minimum wage causes, you could find multiple advantages for businesses that explain why the minimum wage should be raised.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Some people will experience a seizure, but will not go on to be diagnosed with epilepsy, whereas others will. Click here to learn more about epilepsy and diagnosis.\n2. A seizure is a burst of uncontrolled electrical activity between brain cells (also called neurons or nerve cells) that causes temporary abnormalities in muscle tone or movements (stiffness, twitching or limpness), behaviors, sensations or states of awareness.\n3. A seizure is a medical condition where you have a temporary, unstoppable surge of electrical activity in your brain. When that happens, the affected brain cells uncontrollably fire signals to others around them. This kind of electrical activity overloads the affected areas of your brain.\n4. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by repeated seizures. A seizure is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behavior due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain. Normally, the brain continuously generates tiny electrical impulses in an orderly pattern. These impulses travel along neurons \u2014 the network of nerve cells in the brain \u2014 and throughout the whole body via chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.\n5. A seizure is abnormal electrical activity in the brain that happens quickly. It may go nearly unnoticed.

The reason why London is the most expensive city int he world is because it is the financial center of all of Europe. London is much like New York City, but 25% more expensive in my mind. London faces a domestic demand curve and an international demand curve.\n2. For example, the cost of living in London is 15% higher than Manchester. Including rent, London is 52% more expensive than Manchester. (Numbeo)\n3. London is 14.5% more expensive than Paris. This is the smallest difference among all the cities researched in this article, giving the French capital 2nd place among the most pricey European cities.\n4. But one ultimate effect of all this is that businesses have to charge customers more, just to generate the revenues needed to cover their rent. If they didn\u2019t they\u2019d go bust. All this means that it costs more to provide you with a coffee or a sandwich or a pint in London than it would in most British cities \u2013 so prices are higher, too.\n5. House prices in the South East of England would have been roughly 25 percent lower in 2008 and perhaps 30 percent lower in 2015 if the region had planning regulations of similar restrictiveness as the North East of England. That is one of the findings of our new research paper. Real house prices \u2013 but not real incomes \u2013 have grown faster in the UK over the last 40 years than in any other OECD country. Today housing space in England \u2013 particularly in London and the South East but also in other urban centres and large pockets of rural England \u2013 is among the most expensive and unaffordable in the world. Our study shows that this is in large part due to supply constraints imposed by the planning system.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. The federal funds rate, which is set by the central bank, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Whether directly or indirectly, higher Fed rates influence borrowing costs for consumers and, to a lesser extent, the rates they earn on savings accounts.\n2. Federal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers won't be impacted immediately by a rate hike. However, if you have a private loan, those loans may be fixed or have a variable rate tied to the Libor, prime or T-bill rates \u2014 which means that as the Fed raises rates, borrowers will likely pay more in interest, although how much more will vary by the benchmark.\n3. For consumers, the Fed interest rate hike will likely have a range of impacts. If you are planning to finance a major purchase (a house or car for example), your payments could end up being higher. Also if you are carrying variable rate debt, such as credit card balances, you may also see higher interest costs.\n4. Strictly speaking, the Fed can change only a single rate: the federal funds rate. This rate determines how much interest financial institutions charge one another to borrow money overnight. But because so many other rates in the economy are tied to the funds rate, any increase by the Fed has a direct effect on the interest consumers pay when they carry a credit card balance or take out a loan, and on yields for savings accounts and certificates of deposit.\n5. A hike in interest rates boosts the borrowing costs for the U.S. government, fueling an increase in the national debt and increasing budget deficits. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the estimated total budget deficit from 2022 to 2031 will be $12.7 trillion. Increasing rates by just half a percentage point would increase the deficit by $1 trillion.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Pointing a laser at an aircraft can affect a pilot\u2019s ability to safely control the plane or helicopter \u2013 especially during critical phases of flight like take-off and landing. This is particularly dangerous for small aircraft and helicopters, but poses a real risk to large aircraft too.\n2.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. But clouds don't stay up in the air forever, of course. When the warm air keeping clouds afloat cools, its water vapor condenses and adds to the cloud's droplets. At a certain point the droplets become heavy enough to overwhelm the force of the rising air, and all that water falls to the ground.\n2. The second reason that clouds can float in the air is that there is a constant flow of warm air rising to meet the cloud: the warm air pushes up on the cloud and keeps it afloat.\n3. Clouds don\u2019t float forever\u2014if the surrounding air warms up, then the air is able to contain the cloud\u2019s moisture as vapor, and the cloud will disappear. And sometimes, the cloud becomes so large and moist that the water droplets in the cloud begin sticking to each other, and grow bigger and bigger. The water droplets become so big that they no longer behave like dust particles. The droplets begin to fall. If you look up at this kind of cloud, your face will be wet: those droplets are now called \u201crain\u201d and you really ought to go inside.\n4. At a certain height, air cools enough for any water vapour to condense into droplets and form visible clouds. The droplets are liquid water, and therefore denser than air, but they are tiny, so they have a low terminal velocity and fall very slowly. A typical cloud only has about 0.5g of water per cubic metre in it, and if the droplets are small enough, they will be kept aloft by the thermals in the cloud as warm air rises from below. Once the droplets have fused together and grown large enough, gravity dominates over buoyancy and they fall as rain.\n5. Because unlike an elephant, a cloud's weight is spread out over a very large area. Plus, the cloud's droplets and crystals are very small--about one micron, or one-hundred-thousandth of an inch across. A cloud's individual particles are so small, in fact, that warm air rising from the earth's surface is able to keep them floating in the air. It's similar to how dust motes swirl in a shaft of sunlight. Although the bits of dust are affected by gravity, even the gentlest air currents are enough to keep them dancing around in the air.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Most of the world drives on the right side of the road. But around 76 countries and territories use left-hand traffic.\n2. After the Middle Ages, European countries like France and England started to make their own choice about which side of the road to prefer. England was the first nation to pass an official rule, in 1773, which made driving on the left the law. France, on the other hand, chose to drive on the right. The French journey toward this decision might surprise you, however!\n3. Besides Britain, what other countries drive on the left side of the road? Japan, thanks to its railway creation with aid from the British had their trams built on the left hand side, which heavily influenced their driving laws to drive on the left hand side of the road.\n4. Once traffic regulation laws started becoming more common, most countries chose right-hand driving, while in 1835, Britain and its colonies made left handed driving mandatory. Another heavy influence, France\u2019s Napoleon helped spread right sided driving culture in Europe. After World War I, more countries were driving on the right hand side.\n5. The most common reason for countries to switch to driving on the right is for conformity with neighbours, as it increases the safety of cross-border traffic. For example, former British colonies in Africa, such as  Gambia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Ghana, have all changed from left- to right-hand traffic, as they all share borders with former French colonies, which drive on the right. The former Portuguese colony of Mozambique has always driven on the left, as all its neighbours are former British colonies. Decisions by countries to drive on the right typically concern conformity and uniformity rather than practical reasons. There are historical exceptions, such as  postilion riders in France, but such historical advantages do not apply to modern road vehicles.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Moles are concentrations of melanocytes \u2014 the skin cells responsible for the color of our skin. When melanocytes fail to spread out evenly and instead grow in clusters or clumps, the skin there often changes color \u2013 appearing tan, brown, black, red, pink, or blue \u2014 and sometimes has a bump at the site of the build-up. Moles can be congenital, meaning you\u2019re born with them, or formed due to sun exposure.\n2. Moles occur when cells in your skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. Most moles are made of cells called melanocytes, which make the pigment that gives your skin its natural color.\n3. Nearly every adult has a few moles. Most adults have a type of mole called a common mole, which is harmless.\n4. \"The simplest way to explain a mole is as a collection of melanocytes, which are cells that are responsible for producing skin color, eye color and hair color,\" explains Dr. Jih. \"Melanocytes are normally present throughout the body \u2014 when a group of these cells clusters, you get a visible growth known as a mole.\"\n5.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. The United States, like most countries, require escalators to have moving handrails to keep pace with the movement of the steps as an extra safety measure. The moving handrails help riders keep steady when stepping on and off the moving stairs. Sometimes slippage and normal wear and tear can cause the handrail to move at a slightly different speed than the steps. Depending on the escalator, the up and down movement can either be permanently set, automatically set or controlled manually depending on crowd flow.\n2. Have you ever ridden an escalator at the local shopping mall, and tried to leave your hand sitting on top of the handrails? Did you notice that, somehow, your hand was traveling faster than the step your standing on? Well, there's a reason for that, and it all has to do with gears and safety.\n3. On entering, there is a 10 m acceleration zone where the \"ground\" is a series of metal rollers. Riders stand still with both feet on these rollers and use one hand to hold the handrail and let it pull them so that they glide over the rollers. The idea is to accelerate the riders so that they will be traveling fast enough to step onto the moving walkway belt. Riders who try to walk on these rollers are at significant risk of falling over.\n4. To explain further, though, there's another question \u2014 why are there handrails in the first place? All escalators in the United States are required to have a handrail, and the safety codes in some states, like California, have specific rules regarding speed and width. The National Elevator Industry even says, in their safety tips, that it's important for all passengers to hold the handrails when riding an escalator. So, handrails on escalators are important, but even if the rails are supposed to keep pace with the steps, it doesn't always happen, according to the Washington City Paper. Handrails run on a different gear as the steps. Brightside reports that escalator stairs run on gears made from iron that don't wear out as fast, and this ensures speed rarely changes ... but that's not exactly the case with handrails.\n5. Using this walkway is similar to using any other moving walkway, except that there are special procedures to follow when entering or exiting at either end. On entering, there is a 10-metre (33 ft) acceleration zone where the \"ground\" is a series of metal rollers. Riders stand still with both feet on these rollers and use one hand to hold the handrail and let it pull them so that they glide over the rollers. The idea is to accelerate the riders so that they will be traveling fast enough to step onto the moving walkway belt. Riders who try to walk on these rollers are at significant risk of falling over. Once on the walkway, riders can stand or walk as on an ordinary moving walkway. At the exit, the same technique is used to decelerate the riders. Users step onto a series of rollers which decelerate them slowly, rather than the abrupt halt which would otherwise take place.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Understanding how the brain processes and compartmentalizes information can help us to stay focused in an important situation. If you want to avoid forgetting what you went into a room for, try to stay focused and keep the task at the front of your mind until it's done, say researchers.\n2. If you've ever gone to a room with a purpose in mind only to forget what that reason was upon arrival, know that you're not alone. Scientists called this phenomenon the \"doorway effect,\" and it's a real symptom of our brains being overloaded. In order to discover exactly why this happens\u2014and how individuals can improve their memory\u2014a team of researchers conducted a series of experiments using virtual reality. A total of 74 volunteers were asked to remember certain objects, such as a blue cone or a yellow cross, as they moved through various computed-generated 3D rooms. They were then asked to walk down partitioned corridors, or watch other people doing the same routine while completing memory tasks.\n3. - Failing to complete a task creates underlying cognitive tension, which is what makes you keep coming back to it. That\u2019s why we find it easier to recall something that\u2019s ongoing or incomplete than something that is done and over with.\n4. To paraphrase Dr. Palombo, gaining new information can interfere with your memories of old information, when the two are similar. One possibility is that the neural circuitry associated with the old memories gets rewired and harder to access and retrieve later\u2014resulting in what we know as forgetting.\n5. The human brain occupies a fascinating evolutionary in-between of remembering and forgetting. In many cases, we keep only the gist of our experiences...at the expense of holding onto specific details. In fact, forgetting can be attributed to the presence of interfering memories and the fading of memories.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Share All sharing options for: 7 surprising things the government spends more money on than space exploration\n2. If someone is arguing that public funds should be spent on solving the world\u2019s problems, they should know that money spent on NASA positively impacts the U.S. economy. We get the same kind of payoff for space spending in other countries. Spending on space supports highly skilled jobs, fuels technology advancements with practical applications, and creates business opportunities that feed back into the economy. This in turn grows the pool of public money that can be spent on solving the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n3. Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA\u2019s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations. The correct information may go a long way to reassuring critics that space spending isn\u2019t eating up as many public resources as they think.\n4. Most people who love space and believe in exploration have probably heard this once or twice: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t waste money on space exploration when there are problems to deal with here on Earth.\u201d\n5. We've discovered liquid oceans on several different moons in our solar system, but cuts to NASA's planetary science budget (the money it can spend on exploring other planets and moons) mean we won't be sending probes to them for at least a decade.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Each planet in our solar system moves around the Sun differently. This is because their distance from the Sun and the gravitational influence of this massive star determine the exact speed they need to maintain for a steady orbit.\n2. Kepler's First Law: each planet's orbit about the Sun is an ellipse. The Sun's center is always located at one focus of the orbital ellipse. The Sun is at one focus. The planet follows the ellipse in its orbit, meaning that the planet to Sun distance is constantly changing as the planet goes around its orbit.\n3. Our Solar System is an orderly place, with the four inner planets, the asteroid belt, and the gas giant worlds all orbiting in the same plane around the Sun. Even as you go farther out, the Kuiper belt objects appear to line up with that same exact plane. Given that the Sun is spherical and that there are stars appearing with planets orbiting in every direction imaginable, it seems too much of a coincidence to be random chance that all these worlds line up. In fact, practically every Solar System we've observed outside of our own appears to have their worlds line up in the same plane, too, wherever we've been able to detect it. Here's the science behind what's going on, to the best of our knowledge.\n4. Kepler\u2019s other two laws of orbital motion state that a planet\u2019s orbit around the Sun isn\u2019t a perfect circle; instead, it\u2019s elliptical. We can refer to an orbit\u2019s roundness using the term eccentricity. An orbit with zero eccentricity is perfectly circular; a higher eccentricity level indicates an elliptical orbit.\n5. Kepler's three laws describe how planetary bodies orbit the Sun. They describe how (1) planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun as a focus, (2) a planet covers the same area of space in the same amount of time no matter where it is in its orbit, and (3) a planet\u2019s orbital period is proportional to the size of its orbit (its semi-major axis).\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Despite their accuracy and reliability, weather models aren\u2019t able to perfectly simulate the environment. This is because it\u2019s difficult enough to measure every aspect of the current atmosphere. But even if we were able to make observations of all the factors in the atmosphere, those observations would most likely not be perfect. So with the imperfect and limited observations that can be made today, we\u2019re able to create an accurate, but not flawless, model.\n2. Modern weather prediction allows us to do more than just have a better idea of what we should wear for the day, though. These models allow meteorologists to predict the patterns of large storms, intense weather and more. The accuracy of these models means that people can be safer in the case of severe weather and that scientists are able to study changes to climate and hypothesize possible causes. Even though we aren\u2019t able to have weather forecasts perfectly accurate to the degree, modern technology has come a long way in allowing us to understand our complex earth.\n3. All factors considered, modern weather prediction is actually an impressively accurate feat of science. By combining new technology and science, it\u2019s possible to predict the weather at a very reliable rate. Even though it isn\u2019t possible today, and probably ever, to perfectly predict the weather to an exact degree, it\u2019s still extremely helpful to have predictions that are normally less than a few degrees off.\n4. But the problem of predicting specific weather beyond 10 or possibly 15 days in the future with perfect accuracy isn\u2019t one that can be solved with more computing power or better models.

As a result, you may experience pelvic and ovary pain from other medical conditions.\n2. A number of different conditions, from cysts to tumors, can cause ovarian pain. The ovaries are located in the lower abdomen. That means if you have ovarian pain, you'll most likely feel it in your lower abdomen -- below your belly button -- and pelvis. It's important to have any pelvic pain checked out by your regular doctor or obstetrician/gynecologist. Several different conditions can cause it.\n3. That\u2019s a great question! The pelvis is a tight area, with lots of stuff in it, including your bladder, uterus, tubes, ovaries, bowel, muscles, nerves, and fascial tissue. The body has to trasmit information from all these things to the brain for processing. Because it\u2019s such a tight area, there\u2019s only a few spots in the spinal cord that are available to transmit ALL of this information. Once the information gets to the spine, the pain signals all get thrown in together. What your brain reads is \u201cthere\u2019s pain somewhere in my pelvis\u201d. Every body feels that different. Some people feel it as bladder pain or bowel pain, some feel it as ovary pain.\n4. The most common cause of ovary pain is just plain ovulation and hormones (Mittelscherz). When the egg releases from the ovary, a small amount of fluid and blood comes with it. This fluid is irritating to the inside of your pelvis and can cause a quick sharp pain, then a mild ache.\n5. Although pelvic pain often refers to pain in the region of women\u2019s (and people assigned female at birth\u2019s, AFAB) reproductive organs, it can be present in all sexes and can stem from other causes. Pelvic pain might be a symptom of infection or arise from pain in your pelvic bone or nonreproductive internal organs. But in women and people AFAB, pelvic pain can very well be an indication that there might be a problem with one of the reproductive organs in their pelvic area (uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix and vagina).\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The relationship between the atomic composition of polymers and the fuel generating reactions in fires has been studied at various levels using molecular dynamics simulations of polymer thermal decomposition, molar group contributions to combustion properties, and finite element models of burning that require properties obtained from thermal analyses. In this study, a conceptual model is used to link the molecular-level processes of flaming combustion measured in thermal analysis to the fire response of a polymer at the continuum level. A scaling parameter emerges from this analysis called the fire growth capacity/FGC that includes ignitability and burning rate. The FGC was measured in a microscale combustion calorimeter for 32 polymers having a wide range of atomic composition, thermal stability and char forming tendency. It was found that FGC successfully ranks the expected fire performance of these polymers when subjected to a small flame and radiant heat.\n2. A simple burning model is used to connect the continuum-level fire response of polymers to molecular-level thermal decomposition kinetics.\n3. Fires burn only when all that atomic shuffling releases enough energy to keep the oxidation going in a sustained chain reaction. More atoms released from the fuel combine with nearby oxygen. That releases more energy, which releases more atoms. This heats the oxygen \u2014 and so on.\n4. Anyways, going back to what happens on the molecular level: all element have a certain electronegativity (i.e. how attracted they are to electrons). Oxygen has a relatively high electronegativity. Using a standard hydrocarbon as an example, we can see that, during combustion, the nonpolar covalent bonds between hydrogen and carbon are broken and new polar covalent bonds are formed with oxygen. The creation of this new bond releases heat, which contributes to the \"fire\" when the substance combusts rapidly enough.\n5. \u201cWhat fire really is, is a whole bunch of fragments of molecules that have way too much energy,\u201d Finnegan said. \u201cSo they are emitting that energy in the form of heat and light. That\u2019s what we actually see.\u201d\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The pH level of your saliva can drop below 5.5 when you\u2019re drinking acidic beverages. When this happens, the acids in your mouth start to demineralize (break down) tooth enamel.\n2. If you find yourself eating or drinking something with acidic properties, we recommend rinsing your mouth with water immediately afterward. Drinking more water throughout the day can help to keep your saliva balanced and acids under control.\n3. Food and drink change the pH level of saliva. For example, bacteria in your mouth break down the carbohydrates you consume, releasing lactic acid, butyric acid, and aspartic acid. This lowers the pH level of your saliva.\n4. Alcoholic beverages and drinks that are caffeinated all have acidic properties. Limiting your wine intake and only drinking one cup of coffee in the morning is an easy way to keep your saliva pH alkaline. Reducing your intake is a helpful start in making your saliva more balanced.\n5. One of the most simple ways to make your diet more alkaline is to limit bread and sugary sweets. Carbohydrates take the form of sugar or starches soon after digesting, which lowers your pH levels and makes your saliva more acidic.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

In reality, however, your vocal cords vibrate at the same frequency. The helium actually affects the sound quality of your voice (its tone or timbre) by allowing sound to travel faster and thus change the resonances of your vocal tract by making it more responsive to high-frequency sounds.\n2. In order to understand how helium has this effect on a voice, it is helpful to first consider how sound waves form and travel, as well as some basic properties of gases.\n3. I think the topic of this blog post is really interesting and cool. I remember being younger and always sucking the helium out of birthday balloons to speak in a funny high pitched voice. I never thought of why this occurs however and after reading this blog it makes a lot of sense why our voices are altered by helium. I never new that just by inhaling helium we were completely altering the type of gas molecules in our throats which in turn increases the speed of sound in our voices. Helium changes the quality of sound rather than the pitch or frequency of our voices, which overall cause the high pitched change in our voices. Sometimes while inhaling helium I feel a bit light headed and now I know that this is because while inhaling helium I am not receiving the correct amount of oxygen that my brain needs. Here is an article on why inhaling helium makes our voice sound extremely funny, http://mentalfloss.com/article/21590/why-does-inhaling-helium-make-your-voice-sound-funny\n4. If a lighter gas like helium gives us a squeaky-sounding voice, you might to assume that a heavier-than-air gas would amplify the lower resonant frequencies and make it deeper and richer (trading Donald Duck for Barry White, if you will). You'd be correct; gases like xenon and sulfur hexafluoride slow the speed of sound and lower the resonant frequencies of your vocal tract.\n5. This story is interesting. I want to know why does helium only effect if it's around your vocal cords?\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Users can easily sync their iPod with their home computer or computing device and send these files from one device to another. Depending on the type of iPod, users can transfer music files and view music videos, TV shows, full length motion pictures, and even digital photos.\n2. \u00ad The iTunes Store lets iPod users purchase music, movies, podcasts, audiobooks and music videos with a click -- it's an integral part of the iTunes software. You can watch or listen to the files through iTunes on your computer and download them to your iPod. And you don't even have to drag and drop: The iTunes software autosyncs with iPod whenever it's connected to your computer through a USB 2.0 port (you can use FireWire for charging, but not for syncing). Just plug it in, and the iPod automatically downloads every new file that you added to your iTunes jukebox since the last time it was connected. It also uploads to iTunes all new data that you added to your iPod since last the two conversed, like playlists and song ratings.\n3. The Apple iPod is usually categorized as a portable music device that, among other things, plays music files such as MP3s. MP3s are digital files that can be played on most computers today. These are music files that have been changed into a digital format (0s and 1s) and stored on a hard drive or flash memory unit, or in the case of the iPod, a miniature digital hard drive. It should be noted that besides the ability to play MP3s, most iPods can play AAC, WAV, AIFF, Apple Lossless, and Audible 2, 3, and 4 formats.\n4. The iPod is a handheld digital device used for storing, transferring, and playing music and video files. There are several different models but they all have a similar basic design which consists of a \u201cclick-wheel\u201d, a screen, and a lock/unlock switch at the top that prevents the controls from being accidentally activated. The earlier models of the iPod consisted of a hard drive but as technology improved, the newer models were equipped with flash memory, which can be found in any USB-based device. Flash memory allowed for the iPod to be smaller in size while able to hold more information at the same time. The iPod should not be confused with the iPhone, which is similar in functionality but is capable of much more than just playing music. The iPod itself has improved and comes with more functions, including a digital camera, voice recorder, and FM/AM radio.\n5. iTunes is the integrated jukebox/media-player software that comes with an iPod. It lives on your computer, and you use it for organizing, playing, converting and downloading files from an external source to your computer and from your computer to an iPod. This is really no different from the software than comes with any other portable media player. The thing that makes iTunes a brilliant invention from a consumer-electronics standpoint is the built-in iTunes Store that keeps iPod users coming back to Apple on a regular basis. Anyone who owns an iPhone or an iPod touch can also shop at the iTunes store using a WiFi connection.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time someone is expected to live, based on the year of their birth, current age and other demographic factors including their sex. It is used to assess and set a number of important policies that impact on everyday life, for example, setting the State Pension age and targeting health policy initiatives.\n2. Life expectancy is the average number of years that a person is expected to live. It can be calculated for different ages (at birth, at the age of 65\u2026) and it is carried out assuming that mortality rates by age are being maintained (which can also be called age-specific mortality pattern). It is a measure that summarizes the mortality of a country, allowing us to compare it by generations and analyze trends. Its interpretation and meaning is even richer and can provide us with key information on the level of development of a country's welfare state.\n3. By definition, life expectancy is an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n4. To assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called Healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury. Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n5. life expectancy, estimate of the average number of additional years that a person of a given age can expect to live. The most common measure of life expectancy is life expectancy at birth. Life expectancy is a hypothetical measure. It assumes that the age-specific death rates for the year in question will apply throughout the lifetime of individuals born in that year. The estimate, in effect, projects the age-specific mortality (death) rates for a given period over the entire lifetime of the population born (or alive) during that time. The measure differs considerably by sex, age, race, and geographic location. Therefore, life expectancy is commonly given for specific categories, rather than for the population in general. For example, the life expectancy for white females in the United States who were born in 2003 is 80.4 years.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

In my recent post on the relative strength and weakness of various currencies, I didn't address one big question: what determines a currency's value? Is there, in fact, a \u201cright answer\u201d as to the value of each currency?\n2. So who decides how much a currency is worth? For a handful of countries, it\u2019s pretty straightforward: these countries pick a commonly used currency, usually the U.S. dollar or the euro, and \u201cpeg\u201d their own currency\u2019s exchange rate to this currency. For example, Belize\u2019s central bank decided its currency would be worth one-half of a U.S. dollar. Such currencies are called fixed or pegged. Countries usually peg their currencies to maintain stability for investors, who don\u2019t want to worry about fluctuations in the currency\u2019s value. If a currency\u2019s value drops, for example, the value of the investment would drop as well.\n3. The value of currency is determined by its selling and purchase price as a commodity. This is affected by the amount of currency that is bought. When a currency is very popular and many people buy it, then its value increases. However, when a currency is not purchased often, then its value decreases.\n4. A currency\u2019s strength is determined by the interaction of a variety of local and international factors such as the demand and supply in the foreign exchange markets; the interest rates of the central bank; the inflation and growth in the domestic economy; and the country\u2019s balance of trade. Taking all factors into consideration, the currency strength can be evaluated in three dimensions:\n5. Even as countries attempt to manage their currencies, they are implicitly doing so against what they perceive as a \u201cfair,\u201d or properly valued, exchange rate. One way of determining such a fair exchange rate is to compare currencies' ability to buy things. This is not a perfect mirror, since wages, regulations, and actual supplies of different materials vary from country to country, but it is a reasonable proxy. This method is known as \u201cpurchasing power parity,\u201d from the idea that equivalent buying power should result in an equivalent cost in each currency.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

If the speed of light varies with its direction of motion, then we would see the universe in a different way. When we look at distant galaxies we are looking back in time because light takes time to reach us. If distant light reached us quickly in some direction, we would see the universe in that direction as older and more expanded. The faster light reaches us, the less \u201cback in time\u201d we would see. Since we observe a uniform cosmos in all directions, surely that shows the speed of light is constant.\n2. That means if we base our understanding of physics on special relativity (which most modern physicists do), the speed of light is the immutable speed limit of our universe \u2014 the fastest that anything can travel.\n3. In 1728, English physicist James Bradley based a new set of calculations on the change in the apparent position of stars caused by Earth's travels around the sun. He estimated the speed of light at 185,000 miles per second (301,000 km/s) \u2014 accurate to within about 1% of the real value, according to the American Physical Society (opens in new tab).\n4. The speed of light traveling through a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 meters (983,571,056 feet) per second. That's about 186,282 miles per second \u2014 a universal constant known in equations as \"c,\" or light speed.\n5. Think of it like this: Observers sitting on a train could look at a train moving along a parallel track and think of its relative movement to themselves as zero. But observers moving nearly the speed of light would still perceive light as moving away from them at more than 670 million mph. (That's because moving really, really fast is one of the only confirmed methods of time travel \u2014 time actually slows down for those observers, who will age slower and perceive fewer moments than an observer moving slowly.)\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

People who purchase OTC drugs should read and follow the instructions carefully. Because different formulations\u2014such as immediate-release and controlled-release (slow-release) formulations\u2014may have the same brand name, the label should be checked each time a product is purchased, and the dosage should be noted. Assuming that the dosage is the same is not safe.\n2. If a company plans to switch their medication from prescription to non, they must follow the guidelines set out by the FDA. The drug indications for the new OTC release must be comparable to the indication for the prescription drug while still allowing the patient to accurately and easily self-diagnose. The OTC drug should also be relatively safe in regards to toxicity, drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and side effects as well as a minimized potential for abuse. Many clinical trials are performed to determine whether a drug can meet these criteria. Beyond this, labeling must be a clear indicator for patients in how to properly administer the drug in an appropriate dose [Figure 1].\n3. The body processes every medicine differently.

After many years of use under prescription regulation, drugs with excellent safety records may be approved by the FDA for over-the-counter sale.

Signing the back of your credit card was once an important step in helping to prevent fraud. When a person paid with their credit card in the past, a merchant could compare the signature on the receipt with the one on the card. If the signatures matched, the merchant would approve the transaction. If they did not match, the merchant could reject the transaction. Signatures that didn\u2019t match were a sign the card was possibly stolen, personal finance company NerdWallet explains on its website.\n2. Signing the back of your credit card is always better than not, without exception. It\u2019s another step your credit card company uses to try and keep your personal information as safe as possible. When used in conjunction with the card verification value (CVV) on your card, it creates a line of defense should a fraudster try to swipe your plastic.\n3. Signing the back of your credit card is an important security step for protecting your card\u2019s information should it fall into the wrong hands. Merchants are supposed to check that the signature on the card matches the signature on the sales receipt as a security precaution. If a card has no signature on the back, they aren\u2019t required to process the ensuing payment. You also have the option of writing \u201cSee ID\u201d on your cards, in which case the merchant can match the name on your card to your ID.\n4. In reality, it's safe to sign the back of your credit card, if that's what you choose to do. Credit card fraud happens, of course, but it's not because of the signature on the card.\n5.

The documentary, Pets Wild At Heart, which is narrated by once-and-future Doctor Who  David Tennant, explains that hamsters come equipped with built-in travel coolers \u2014 incredibly stretchy cheek pouches that stretch all the way down to their hips. The cute little rodents can also turn off their saliva glands, which means they can preserve their fancy feasts for any time they are feeling peckish.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Under regular use, an alkaline battery will not leak. Manufacturing defects can cause leakage, but by far, the most common reason for leaky batteries is a lack of use. When batteries sit in unused devices for long periods, hydrogen can build up in the battery cell until the pressure causes the battery\u2019s insulating seals to breach. The gas is harmlessly released, but the rupture also provides an exit point for the battery cell\u2019s chemical components.\n2. Let\u2019s get the most obvious question out of the way first: why do batteries leak? Alkaline batteries generate power through chemical reactions within the battery cell. These reactions create hydrogen gas, which is usually not a problem. If too much gas develops, the battery cell ruptures, releasing the white sticky substance we call battery acid.\n3. All alkaline batteries eventually discharge themselves whether in a device or not. As they do, they generate a small amount of hydrogen gas. Eventually, this causes the case to rupture and the alkaline electrolyte inside to leak out. If cases have corroded or taken damage, then alkaline battery leaks can happen sooner. The only workaround is to recycle alkaline batteries as soon as they go flat.\n4. Alkaline battery leakage is potassium hydroxide, and it\u2019s an alkaline, not an acid. So why call it battery acid? The term comes from the sulphuric acid used in lead car batteries, which is much more toxic.\n5. What is never said is that the real reason alkaline batteries leak since ~1908 is that around that time, all manufactures removed mercury from alkaline batteries. The function of mercury was to react with the zinc shell to form a coating that resisted corrosion by the batteries\u2019 chemicals. Henceforth they all leaked, with the better batteries having an outer shell that resisted exit of the internal leak. The pressure-reducing vent at the bottom of the battery is now the weakest link.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Post-structuralism refers to the intellectual developments in continental philosophy and critical theory that were outcomes of twentieth-century French philosophy. The prefix \"post\" refers to the fact that many contributors such as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Julia Kristeva were former structuralists who, after abandoning structuralism, became quite critical of it. In direct contrast to structuralism's claims of culturally independent meaning, post-structuralists typically view culture as inseparable from meaning.\n2. Post-structuralism is a term for philosophical and literary forms of theory that both build upon and reject ideas established by structuralism, the intellectual project that preceded it. Though post-structuralists all present different critiques of structuralism, common themes among them include the rejection of the self-sufficiency of structuralism, as well as an interrogation of the binary oppositions that constitute its structures. Accordingly, post-structuralism discards the idea of interpreting media (or the world) within pre-established, socially constructed structures.\n3. Post-structuralism may be understood as a critical response to the basic assumptions of structuralism. Structuralism was a fashionable movement in France in the 1950s and 1960s, that studied the underlying structures inherent in cultural products (such as texts), and utilizes analytical concepts from linguistics, psychology, anthropology and other fields to understand and interpret those structures. Although the structuralist movement fostered critical inquiry into these structures, it emphasized logical and scientific results. Many structuralists sought to integrate their work into pre-existing bodies of knowledge. This was observed in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure in linguistics, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss in anthropology, and many early twentieth-century psychologists.\n4. In addition to those discussed above, the following are often said to be post-structuralists, or to have had a post-structuralist period:\n5. Post-structuralism rejects the notion of the essential quality of the dominant relation in the hierarchy, choosing rather to expose these relations and the dependency of the dominant term on its apparently subservient counterpart. The only way to properly understand these meanings is to deconstruct the assumptions and knowledge systems which produce the illusion of singular meaning.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Unfortunately, I can\u2019t do that, because there is no definitive answer. It seems that if you\u2019re at a standalone pedestrian crossing that is far from any other sort of traffic junction, pushing the button will turn the traffic light red. But at any other sort of traffic-pedestrian interface, what the button does depends on where you are, what time it is, and what type of crossing you\u2019re at.\n2. The short answer is - it depends. At a standalone pedestrian crossing, unconnected to a junction, the button will turn a traffic light red.\n3. There's no need to remove buttons, says Baggini. But a little more honesty about what they do would be nice. \"Traffic planners don't need to mislead us.

Pre-1970s, traffic in the city was lighter, and could be managed without a supercomputer and a team of traffic engineers. Back then, these buttons really did make a difference. Nowadays, just 120 of them are pedestrian actuated, but it\u2019s impossible to tell which ones are which, just by looking at them. So, my advice is to PUSH THE BUTTON.

But surprisingly, myocardial infarction doesn\u2019t actually rank as the most common cause of sudden death among younger guys, says Gerald Wydro, M.D., chair of emergency medicine at Aria Health in Philadelphia.\n2. Heart arrhythmias don\u2019t always cause instant death. Some people have a chronic arrhythmia that occurs for years, with few or no symptoms. When doctors do catch it, the condition can be manageable and is often not life-threatening.\n3. Most people immediately jump to thoughts of a heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest when they notice an unusual feeling around their heart. While feeling like your heart is going to explode may be an early symptom of both of these, you\u2019ll likely notice other symptoms as well.\n4. Dying immediately with the onset of symptoms (called Sudden Cardiac Death) in people over 35 is most often from coronary artery disease and heart attack. In people younger that 35, it is usually from a primary heart rhythm problem caused by cardiomyopathies. These are abnormalities of the heart muscle such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (too thick heart muscle), right ventricular cardiomyopathy (parts of the right ventricle are replaced with fibro-fatty tissue), or a primary heart rhythm disturbance which is an abnormality of the heart's electrical system. These causes in the young generally have a genetic component.\n5. About one in 500 people have some form of this heart disorder, which causes the walls of your heart muscle to thicken and lose their pumping power. Approximately 1 percent of people with the disorder die suddenly each year, usually because of a too-rapid heartbeat\u2014and many of them are young and unaware they even have heart issues.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

One of the reasons why companies still send out rebates is the fact that the majority of customers forget to mail in their requirements after the purchase. According to a statement by Consumer World, 60% of rebates are never redeemed. Companies are hoping that their customers will forget to mail rebates, which causes a justifiable rebate rejection. And if the rebates are rejected, the company doesn\u2019t need to release funds at all while still getting their sales numbers.\n2. Another reason why mail-in rebates still exist is to draw customers to make a purchase. There are even products that offer rebates for the full purchase price or up to 80% of the original price, just to entice shoppers into buying.\n3.

They\u2019re a fantastic way to save on the things you need (as long as you remember to send in the required forms, of course).

In return for buying certain brands, manufacturers will give you full or partial reimbursement. All mail-in rebates require you to buy the product first then fill out a rebate form. You\u2019ll then have to mail the form along with your proof of purchase\u2014typically a receipt or the UPC code from the packaging. You\u2019ll receive a check or gift card about 4-8 weeks later.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

There is no one answer to this question as McDonald\u2019s does not release this information to the public. However, there are many theories and opinions on the matter. Some say that McDonald\u2019s burgers are fresh, while others say they are frozen. There is no way to know for sure without asking McDonald\u2019s directly.\n2. A lot of people ask how fresh McDonald\u2019s food is. The answer may surprise you. McDonald\u2019s food is actually pretty fresh. The company has a strict quality control process that ensures all food is fresh and safe to eat. McDonald\u2019s sources its food from trusted suppliers. All meat is fresh and never frozen. The company also uses fresh produce in its salads and sandwiches. McDonald\u2019s food is prepared fresh throughout the day. So, how fresh is McDonald\u2019s food? It\u2019s actually pretty fresh. The company has strict quality controls in place to ensure all food is fresh and safe to eat.\n3. Fresh beef has a shorter shelf life than frozen, noted Dale Rogers, professor of logistics and supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s W.P. Carey School of Business. This means that it needs to be brought from the suppliers to McDonald\u2019s more quickly than frozen beef.\n4. Burger King\u2019s decision to switch to fresh beef is a positive step forward in the chain\u2019s evolution. The quality of fresh beef makes it a more flavorful and satisfying burger that consumers will appreciate. In addition, using fresh beef rather than frozen meat is a more environmentally friendly option because frozen meat consumes a lot of energy to maintain its frozen state. McDonald\u2019s switching to fresh beef is a good step, but some ingredients used in its food may not be suitable for the environment. The chain\u2019s patties, for example, contain fillers and preservatives, which can have a negative impact on the environment. Even if these ingredients are not ideal, they are better than nothing. McDonald\u2019s made the right decision in replacing the frozen beef with fresh beef. Despite this, the chain still has a lot of work to do in terms of sustainable development.\n5. McDonald\u2019s began testing fresh (rather than frozen) beef in a handful of stores earlier this year, and considering the subpar quality of its burgers, that certainly sounds like a good thing. Or does it? A recent survey of McDonald\u2019s franchisees suggests store owners are concerned that the introduction of fresh burger patties could end up spelling disaster for the brand.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissue are delicate and do not provide lubrication like the vagina does, so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a personal lubricant is not used. Anal sex without protection of a condom is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity, and therefore health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend safe sex practices for anal sex.\n2. Anal sex means penis-in-anus (butt) intercourse. Some people enjoy anal sex, and some people don't like it at all. Either way is perfectly fine. If you don't like it or don't want to try it, it\u2019s not ok for someone to pressure you into it. Sex should feel good and be comfortable for both of you.\n3. Anal sex is when a penis or other object is inserted into a partner\u2019s anus. Like any other sexual behavior, some people find it very pleasurable and others don\u2019t. Some people are curious about it, and others know it\u2019s not something they\u2019re comfortable with. There is nothing wrong with engaging in anal sex, but whether it is right for you is something only you can decide.\n4. Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure. Other forms of anal sex include fingering, the use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging. Although anal sex most commonly means penile\u2013anal penetration, sources sometimes use anal intercourse to exclusively denote penile\u2013anal penetration, and anal sex to denote any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.\n5. People have a lot of different feelings about anal sex. Some people think that only those who identify as gay have anal sex. But that\u2019s not true. Anal sex can and is practiced by both gay and heterosexual couples. At the same time, some gay couples and some heterosexual couples don\u2019t engage in anal sex.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

ELI5:How was Bobby Kennedy's appointment as US Attorney General by his brother not seen as nepotism?\n2. {mosads}Initially, many Americans were skeptical about John F. Kennedy\u2019s younger brother. They saw him as ambitious, arrogant and aggressive. They even questioned his qualifications to be attorney general. When critics accused President Kennedy of nepotism, JFK disarmed them with humor, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t see that it\u2019s wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law.\u201d\n3. \"You could describe it as arrogance in thinking that because you were elected president, that your brother or your daughter or your son-in-law belong in the White House as well. And Bobby Kennedy was on the one hand, a case study of the arrogance of a president thinking that his brother deserved to be Attorney General. And yet, [Bobby] met the highest of standards whether the issue was civil rights, whether it was going after organized crime, whether it was cracking down an allegedly corrupt teamsters union and Jimmy Hoffa, Bobby Kennedy did all of that. He defied all the Democrats' political wishes by going after Democrats as well as Republicans.

For example, civil aircraft may be flown in formation as part of flying club activities. As a further example, civil and military aerobatics teams, such as the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron (well known the world over as \u201cThe Blue Angels\u201d) perform aerobatics maneuvers in formation. In the example of The Blue Angels, high-performance tactical aircraft, such as the F/A-18 Hornet manufactured by The Boeing Company, are flown at speeds in excess of 500 knots in formations with as little as eighteen inches of separation between a wingtip of one plane and the helmet of the pilot of an adjacent plane in the formation.\n2. Between the World Wars and into World War II, military pilots continued to experiment with different formations, distances, and positions. In bad weather, close to an airport, or while performing in air shows, they flew closer together. When going cross-country, searching for the enemy, or in situations that might require sudden and sharp turns that increased the risk of collision, they separated farther apart in a formation known as \u201ccombat spread.\u201d Whereas airplanes in close formations may be a metre or so apart, in a combat spread formation modern jet-engine fighters may be several hundred metres apart.\n3. formation flying, two or more aircraft traveling and maneuvering together in a disciplined, synchronized, predetermined manner. In a tight formation, such as is typically seen at an air show, aircraft may fly less than three feet (one metre) apart and must move in complete harmony, as if they are joined together.\n4. - For the reasons set forth above regarding collision avoidance with aircraft not flying in the formation, in a presently preferred embodiment the collision deconfliction threshold suitably is expressed in terms of time regardless of whether the collision to be deconflicted is with an aircraft flying in the formation or outside the formation. As is known, aircraft flying in the formation generally fly parallel to each other. However, the aircraft flying in the formation may also maneuver relative to each other. As a result, distances that correlate to a time of approximately 30 seconds before a collision may span a wide range (as discussed above for avoiding collisions with aircraft flying outside the formation). Accordingly, in a presently preferred embodiment, the collision deconfliction threshold suitably is measured in terms of time (such as, for example, around 30 seconds or so) before a collision.\n5. - Aircraft frequently fly in formation. Each aircraft in a formation flight occupies and maintains a position relative to each other aircraft in the formation. Such a relative position is referred to as a station, and maintaining that relative position is referred to as station keeping.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

To wrap this up, the Twitter IPO will certainly impact the future of business and social media. It comes at a time when Wall Street investors are asking a lot of questions. Its journey from a Social Network To Media Giant has in fact already begun, and the IPO is just one more step towards accelerated growth for Twitter.\n2. Twitter is thought to have a favorable time as compared to the other social medias. Currently, the US economy is reviving hence an ideal time for an IPO. The only worry is that stock markets in the globe are not at its best and this may trigger bad things to happen. If all goes well with this IPO, other companies will have to embrace themselves cautiously in future.\n3. Twitter releasing reports from its study commissioned from research firm Datalogix could be one way in which the microblogging site has chosen to set the backdrop for its IPO. Giving people data and statistical information about the impact that Twitter has on marketing and branding, both online and offline, is one way of winning the confidence of investors ahead of an IPO.\n4. Really enjoyed reading this post! Agree completely about the factors you identified that have led to Twitter\u2019s decline. Ultimately, as you said at the end, Twitter has not been able to iterate on its product to propagate the network effects that were baked into its valuation by investors. It\u2019s interesting to me that Wall Street expected Twitter to grow as large as FB at IPO. From what I know, the engagement, and thus, the content, on Twitter is generated by a very small percentage of the overall user base. I would assume that this concentration of engagement would mean that the direct network effects are impacted strongly by these power users. Twitter\u2019s inability to engage the general user base, unlike FB, has led to a lower direct network effect for the platform.\n5. The main goal of an IPO is to get an additional fund to finance its operation. If Twitter takes this route, there is high probability that they will win a lot of industry players. They will be able to make new investment by expansion and also including new players who will include investors, marketers and consumers. Twitter will also be the ultimate tool for connecting consumers and companies not just an ordinary social site like any other.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. How does VHS work? The Video Home System is a magnetic tape onto which video and audio signals are recorded. The principle is the same as a cassette tape, but an audio signal tops out at about 20,000 Hz, which isn\u2019t a lot of information compared to video. A slow tape moving over a stationary magnetic head will do.\n2. In the original VHS specification, audio was recorded as baseband in a single linear track, at the upper edge of the tape, similar to how an audio compact cassette operates. The recorded frequency range was dependent on the linear tape speed. For the VHS SP mode, which already uses a lower tape speed than the compact cassette, this resulted in a mediocre frequency response of roughly 100 Hz to 10 kHz for NTSC,[citation needed] frequency response for PAL VHS with its lower standard tape speed was somewhat worse. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was an acceptable 42 dB. Both parameters degraded significantly with VHS's longer play modes, with EP/NTSC frequency response peaking at 4 kHz. S-VHS tapes can give better audio (and video) quality, because the tapes are designed to have almost twice the bandwidth of VHS at the same speed.\n3. Sound cannot be recorded on a VHS tape without recording a video signal, even in the audio dubbing mode. If there is no video signal to the VCR input, most VCRs will record black video and generate a control track while the sound is being recorded. Some early VCRs record audio without a control track signal; this is of little use, because the absence of a signal from the control track means that the linear tape speed is irregular during playback.\n4. The VHS cassette is a 187 mm wide, 103 mm deep, 25 mm thick (73\u20448 \u00d7 41\u204416\u00d7 1 inch) plastic shell held together with five Phillips head screws. The flip-up cover, which allows players and recorders to access the tape, has a latch on the right side, with a push-in toggle to release it (bottom view image). The cassette has an anti-despooling mechanism, consisting of several plastic parts between the spools, near the front of the cassette (white and black in the top view). The spool latches are released by a push-in lever within a 6.35 mm (1\u20444 inch) hole at the bottom of the cassette, 19 mm (3\u20444 inch) in from the edge label.[citation needed] The tapes are made, pre-recorded, and inserted into the cassettes in cleanrooms, to ensure quality and to keep dust from getting embedded in the tape and interfering with recording (both of which could cause signal dropouts)\n5. A-You will never see a videocassette tape that can be played on both sides. Audiocassette tape travels past the tape head in a straight line. The tape head contains two ultranarrow magnetic gaps for recording and playing the two stereo channels. The stereo channels fill less than half of the tape, so you can turn the cassette over and record the other half. This is possible because the bandwidth of an audio signal is fairly narrow and not much tape is required to store it.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Well, it has to do with how interest accumulates, how you are repaying your loan, and how things went wrong along the way (such as by defaulting). Let me walk you through an example where a student loan can double in under 10 years.\n2. Currently interest rates on subsidized Stafford student loans -- the federal loans designed for qualified low-income students -- are scheduled to double as of July 1 from their current rate of 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. If it happens, the increase will impact nearly 8 million students and tack on an additional $1,000 over the life of their loans, reports the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Exactly how much each student will be affected will vary according to the amount they borrowed and their repayment schedule.\n3. So there you have it, folks. This is how a $45,000 loan can double in less than 10 years. I see this all the time, and it really is astounding. I\u2019ve said before, and I\u2019ll say it again: we need major student loan reform in this country.\n4. Millions of Americans are struggling economically, weighed down by overwhelming student loan debt \u2013 more than $1 trillion worth. And according to the Federal Reserve, about two-thirds of that debt is held by people under 30. The situation is about to get much, much worse. Starting July 1, the interest rates on federally subsidized Stafford loans are set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. This hike in the interest rate is about to hit more than seven million students taking out loans next year.\n5. If you already have a fixed-rate student loan, decisions made by the Federal Reserve won\u2019t affect you at all. However, if you\u2019re taking out a new loan, your rate will be reflect current trends. If your student loan has a variable interest rate, you\u2019ll feel the Fed rate changes the most; when the Fed raises or lowers borrowing costs, your interest rates will likely respond. This could mean that you pay more or less in interest over time, depending on how the Fed rate changes.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The Supreme Court actually had responded only to a plea to share the benefits of marriage (and, by implication, the option of divorce) with a category of individuals whom the court in a series of decisions over the years has treated as entitled to equal treatment under the Constitution.\n2. Chief Justice John Roberts was also concerned with the traditional definition of marriage. He said this to Mary L. Bonauto, an attorney representing the challengers: \u201cYou\u2019re not seeking to join the institution, you\u2019re seeking to change what the institution is.\u201d\n3. As recently as two years ago, the Supreme Court in the case of United States v. Windsor ruled explicitly that state governments remain the primary authority to define marriage and its benefits. It did so in striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied federal marital benefits to same-sex couples who were legally married in their home states, under state law allowing such marriages.\n4. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas. Referring to Washington v. Glucksberg, in which the Court stated the Due Process Clause protects only rights and liberties that are \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\", Alito argued that \"right\" to same-sex marriage would not meet this definition. Alito defended the rationale of the states, accepting that same-sex marriage bans serve to promote procreation and childrearing. Expressing concern for judicial abuse, Alito concluded, \"Most Americans\u2014understandably\u2014will cheer or lament today\u2019s decision because of their views on the issue of same-sex marriage. But all Americans, whatever their thinking on that issue, should worry about what the majority\u2019s claim of power portends.\"\n5.

Even as American political culture helps to explain the health care debate in America, culture is far from the only reason America lacks universal coverage. Another factor that has limited debate about national health insurance is the role of interest groups in influencing the political process. The legislative battle over the content of the ACA, for example, generated US$1.2 billion in lobbying in 2009 alone.\n2. A third reason America lacks universal health coverage and the 2016 candidates have avoided the topic altogether is that America\u2019s political institutions make it difficult for massive entitlement programs to be enacted. As policy experts have pointed out in studies of the U.S. health system, the country doesn\u2019t \u201chave a comprehensive national health insurance system because American political institutions are structurally biased against this kind of comprehensive reform.\u201d\n3. Pew Research Center asked these questions on a recent survey to understand Americans\u2019 opinions about the federal government\u2019s role in providing health care coverage. For this analysis, we conducted an online survey of 11,001 U.S. adults between July 27 and Aug. 2, 2020.\n4. U.S. healthcare underperforms in most verticals. High cost is the primary reason that prevents Americans from accessing health care services. Americans with below-average incomes are much more affected, since visiting a physician when sick, getting a recommended test, or follow-up care has become unaffordable.

The determination that these mid-size ripples are a distinct type resulted from observations by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. Six months ago, Curiosity made the first up-close study of active sand dunes anywhere other than Earth, at the \"Bagnold Dunes\" on the northwestern flank of Mars' Mount Sharp.\n2. Besides the sinuous crests, another similarity between the mid-size ripples on Mars and underwater ripples on Earth is that, in each case, one face of each ripple is steeper than the face on the other side and has sand flows, as in a dune. Researchers conclude that the meter-scale ripples are built by Martian wind dragging sand particles the way flowing water drags sand particles on Earth -- a different mechanism than how either dunes or impact ripples form. Lapotre and co-authors call them \"wind-drag ripples.\"\n3. Images of Martian sand dunes taken from orbit have, for years, shown ripples about 10 feet (3 meters) apart on dunes' surfaces. Until Curiosity studied the Bagnold Dunes, the interpretation was that impact ripples on Mars could be several times larger than impact ripples on Earth. Features the scale of Earth's impact ripples would go unseen at the resolution of images taken from orbit imaging and would not be expected to be present if the meter-scale ripples were impact ripples.\n4. Two sizes of ripples are evident in this Dec. 13, 2015, view of a top of a Martian sand dune, from NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. Sand dunes and the smaller type of ripples also exist on Earth.\u203a Full image and caption\n5. Earth also has smaller ripples -- appearing in rows typically less than a foot (less than 30 centimeters) apart -- that are formed by wind-carried sand grains colliding with other sand grains along the ground.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Gravity is the reason things with mass or energy are attracted to each other. It is why apples fall toward the ground and planets orbit stars.\n2. Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity (proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915), which describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing\u2014not even light\u2014can escape once past the black hole's event horizon. However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:\n3. With his theory of relativity, Albert Einstein explained how gravity is more than just a force: it is a curvature in the space-time continuum. That sounds like something straight out of science fiction, but simply put, the mass of an object causes the space around it to essentially bend and curve. This is often portrayed as a heavy ball sitting on a rubber sheet, and other smaller balls fall in towards the heavier object because the rubber sheet is warped from the heavy ball\u2019s weight.\n4. In 1915, Albert Einstein figured out the answer when he published his theory of general relativity. The reason gravity pulls you toward the ground is that all objects with mass, like our Earth, actually bend and curve the fabric of the universe, called spacetime. That curvature is what you feel as gravity.\n5. When folks ask what the big deal is with the Higgs Bosun, I point out that understanding mass and \u201cstuff\u201d can help us understand what causes gravity \u2013 and understanding what causes gravity could lead to manipulation of gravity. I point out that the artificial gravity on spaceships in say, Star Trek, is completely impossible as we know it right now, but getting to the bottom (ha!) of gravity may make that possible.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Aquinas' Argument from Motion begins with the empirical observation of motion in the world. Hence, this argument is an \u00e0 posteriori argument, and the conclusion is not claimed to follow with certainty.\n2. Thomas Aquinas famously laid out five arguments for the existence of God, but he characterized one of them as \u201cthe first and more manifest way.\u201d This is the proof from motion, which can be presented simply and schematically as follows. Things move. Since nothing moves itself, everything that is moved must be moved by another. If that which causes the motion is itself being moved, then it must be moved by another. This process cannot go on to infinity. Therefore, there must exist a first unmoved mover, which all people call God.\n3. Aquinas\u2019s first three arguments\u2014from motion, from causation, and from contingency\u2014are types of what is called the cosmological argument for divine existence. Each begins with a general truth about natural phenomena and proceeds to the existence of an ultimate creative source of the universe. In each case, Aquinas identifies this source with God.\n4. Aquinas\u2019s first demonstration of God\u2019s existence is the argument from motion. He drew from Aristotle\u2019s observation that each thing in the universe that moves is moved by something else. Aristotle reasoned that the series of movers must have begun with a first or prime mover that had not itself been moved or acted upon by any other agent. Aristotle sometimes called this prime mover \u201cGod.\u201d Aquinas understood it as the God of Christianity.\n5. Abstract: Thomas' argument that since everything that moves is moved by another, there must thereby exist an Unmoved Mover is outlined and explained. Objections to that argument are also briefly examined.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

These are the most popular size cigarettes and are the size right below 100mm. The overall length of the cigarette is longer than the 70mm due to a filter that is attached on one end of the cigarette.\n2. A pack of cigarettes will cost you anywhere from $5 to $10, depending on where you buy them from and which brand you buy. Specialty tobacco stores will raise the prices on their products, while tobacco products sold in convenience stores have state tax added on.\n3. What size is a 120 cigarette? What exactly is a king size cigarette? Ever heard anyone ask these questions? Well, it's very common for people to ask questions regarding the different sizes of cigarettes that are available on the market. The question of size usually comes around when someone is trying to buy accessories such as cigarette cases, cigarette pack holders or cigarette rolling machines. There are many reasons why it's important to know your cigarette sizes well. It's especially important when it comes to cigarette accessories because these are often size specific. The answers can differ because it will largely depend on which manufacturer makes the cigarette and whether you are talking about store bought commercial cigarettes or roll-your-own cigarettes using rolling papers. For more information on making your own cigarettes, see our How To Roll Your Own Cigarettes page.\n4. Cigarette smokers were then asked the pack size of their current brand (in number of cigarettes or grams) and questions to ascertain pack/pouch price, including pack type for FM cigarettes (single pack, multipack containing \u2264100 cigarettes, or carton containing >100 cigarettes). We configured these responses into cents per cigarette (or per 0.8 g of RYO tobacco (the weight at which duty on a RYO cigarette is equivalent to that of a FM cigarette)).49 Reported prices were then adjusted for inflation to March 2014 prices using the quarterly CPI.50 Respondents were also asked if they had tried any other brand in the previous month because it was cheaper than usual, and how often in the past month they had thought about much they spend on smoking (many or several times vs never or once or twice).\n5. Table 2 shows that the odds of having purchased current packs of FM cigarettes in multipacks significantly increased over the study period, from 2.9% pre-PP to 4.8% in the transition phase, 6.4% in PP year 1 and 9.4% in the PP post-tax phase (table 2). Odds of having purchased one's current pack as a single pack significantly declined between the pre-PP (84.2%) and the PP year 1 and PP post-tax periods. Carton purchases did not differ between the pre-PP and subsequent phases; 13.1% of packs were purchased this way overall.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Ponsa-Kraus, professor of legal history at Columbia Law School, some American legislators feared that racial mixing would occur among white Americans in the contiguous United States and non-white Puerto Ricans if Puerto Rico were admitted as a state. Puerto Ricans were restricted to limited self-governance\u2014under a U.S.-appointed governor\u2014and did not have U.S. citizenship.\n2. Pro-independence movements on the island continued to call for autonomy. To quell tensions, in 1917, the U.S. passed the Jones-Shafroth Act, which gave most Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship\u2014but with limitations. Under the act, a senate and bill of rights was established; however, the U.S. president and Congress still had the power to veto Puerto Rican laws. The Selective Service Act, meanwhile, required men in the United States\u2014including Puerto Rico\u2014to register for military service. During World War I, nearly 20,000 Puerto Rican men fought on behalf of the United States.\n3. -   -   -   - Located about a thousand miles southeast of Florida, Puerto Rico is a Caribbean archipelago with a complex colonial history and political status. As a territory of the United States, Puerto Rico\u2019s 3.2 million residents are U.S. citizens. However, while subject to U.S. federal laws, island-based Puerto Ricans can\u2019t vote in presidential elections and lack voting representation in Congress. As a U.S. territory, it is neither a state nor an independent country.\n4. In November 2020, Puerto Ricans voted in a non-binding referendum on statehood. About 53 percent of Puerto Ricans favored statehood, while 47 percent rejected it. However, only 55 percent of Puerto Ricans voted in the referendum. Statehood proponents viewed the results as proof that most Puerto Ricans want the territory to be admitted, but opponents questioned the validity of the votes as referendums are unbinding, often promoted solely by the pro-statehood party and include the opinions of only half of Puerto Ricans. Some people oppose statehood based on the argument that Puerto Rico will assimilate to the United States if it becomes a state.\n5. More than three decades later, in 1950, the United States allowed Puerto Rico to draft a constitution, as long as it did not alter its territorial status and established a republican form of government and a bill of rights. After the Legislature of Puerto Rico held a constitutional convention to draft the constitution, it was approved by the president and Congress in 1952. Under the new constitution, Puerto Rico was designated the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Germany\u2019s defeat in World War I should have killed off or critically weakened German militarism, nationalism and faith in authoritarianism \u2013 but these powerful ideas refused to die. They survived in the post-war period and helped undermine Weimar democracy.\n2. The reasons for the Weimar Republic's collapse are the subject of continuing debate. It may have been doomed from the beginning since even moderates disliked it and extremists on both the left and right loathed it, a situation often referred to as a \"democracy without democrats\". Germany had limited democratic traditions, and Weimar democracy was widely seen as chaotic. Since Weimar politicians had been blamed for the Dolchsto\u00df (\"stab-in-the-back\"), a widely believed theory that Germany's surrender in the First World War had been the unnecessary act of traitors, the popular legitimacy of the government was on shaky ground. As normal parliamentary lawmaking broke down and was replaced around 1930 by a series of emergency decrees, the decreasing popular legitimacy of the government further drove voters to extremist parties.\n3. The Weimar Republic, the post\u2013World War I German government named for the German city where it was formed, lasted more than 14 years, but democracy never found firm footing. This chapter explores Germany in the years preceding the Nazis' ascension to power by highlighting efforts to turn a fledgling republic into a strong democracy and examining the misunderstandings, myths, and fears that often undercut those efforts.\n4. Some historians believe the Weimar Republic failed mainly because of post-war conditions in Germany. Others suggest longer-term factors, such as Germany\u2019s inexperience with democratic forms of government, were significant. Others still point to failings in the international order, such as Germany\u2019s brutal post-war treatment and isolation by the Allies.\n5. 1. The Weimar era began with one of the most democratic constitutions that had existed up to that point. But by 1933, Germany was poised to become a dictatorship. Why did democracy in Germany fail? What were the roles of political parties, the judiciary, the educational system, the economy, and the beliefs and attitudes of citizens themselves? Does Weimar teach us anything about what is necessary to sustain and protect democracy?\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The source of the memory corruption and its manifestation may be far apart, making it hard to correlate the cause and the effect.\n2. Memory corruption is a computer problem where a programming error generates an issue with the memory. When the user attempts to access the memory, the computer can behave strangely as it attempts to process the information. This can occur as a result of user errors, viruses, or glitches in a program or operating system. Users can apply various techniques to address this problem.\n3. Memory corruption occurs in a computer program when the contents of a memory location are modified due to programmatic behavior that exceeds the intention of the original programmer or program/language constructs; this is termed as violation of memory safety. The most likely causes of memory corruption are programming errors (software bugs). When the corrupted memory contents are used later in that program, it leads either to program crash or to strange and bizarre program behavior. Nearly 10% of application crashes on Windows systems are due to heap corruption.\n4. Memory corruption usually occurs when some piece of code is using an area of memory that it should not. The corrupt memory then causes problems in some code\n5. Sometimes the memory corruption is the result of malicious code or a deliberate attack on a computer system. Operating systems and programs can have vulnerabilities, and a programmer may exploit these with code intended to create memory corruption. This may be done to sabotage a system or leave it open to access so a hacker can reach information that would normally be secure. The corruption can be costly to fix, and may render the system unusable until a technical professional can identify and repair the problem.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

In 1958, the giant balloons in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade were filled with air instead of helium because of yet another shortage. But while this is not a new problem, helium supplies have grown particularly low lately because existing sources are dwindling and future projects have been delayed, Mr. Kornbluth said.\n2. Manufacturers have stated that this wasted helium is considered a \u2018recycled product\u2019 as it would have been lost to the environment had it not been captured and re-purposed. If the balloon market demand declined, manufacturers would have to re-evaluate other markets and consider the possibilities of re-liquefying it.

For many New Yorkers, the only wildlife we get to see are squirrels\u200b or pigeons. I suspect that these common animals can become the \u201cgateway drug\u201d to nature for many city dwellers. This theory is backed by the university study called \u201cThe Pigeon Paradox,\u201d which posits that pigeons are the only real nature people in cities are exposed to, and how important that is to the appreciation and enjoyment of natural world in general.\n2. The first reason is that, like many native New Yorkers, pigeons don\u2019t like to leave. \u201cThey don\u2019t migrate,\u201d says Heath Waldorf, vice president of Bell Environmental in Parsippany, New Jersey. \u201cLost of other pest birds migrate\u2014geese, blackbirds, sparrows. But pigeons are here all year round.\u201d\n3. There is a great deal more avian diversity in New York City than just pigeons, house sparrows and starlings. If you go into the parks, you will see tufted titmice, robins, red-tailed hawks, mourning doves, cardinals and, if you were lucky a few weeks ago, the fabulous snowy owl. Central Park is also a major migration flyway for many bird species in springtime, which bring an additional group of temporary and exciting passersby. But this diversity is not distributed evenly in this fragmented urban landscape. So, what if, like spring last year, you didn\u2019t feel safe walking into the park crowded with people, so you looked out the window instead?\n4. Unless you are a shut-in, you know what pigeons look like. What you might not know is that they are the number one pest bird in America. Pigeons are known for their plump bodies, colorful plumage, bulging foreheads, and wide eyes. They are also known for their wide variety of body colors. Although very pretty to look at, pigeons are a huge nuisance here in New York. Some have even become bold enough to steal food right out of people\u2019s hands. For most residents here in New York City, however, pigeons are nothing more than an afterthought. If they are not directly bothering you, how harmful could they be? Turns out, much more than you might think.\n5. The species of pigeon in New York, Waldorf says, originated in England, where they perched high on the famed cliffs of Dover. This is another reason the birds love New York: the high-rise buildings remind them of home.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

For example, a 2014 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that the 10 precincts with the longest lines in Florida had fewer poll workers than the statewide average.172 Polling place closures also cause problems for voters, as fewer polling places often result in longer lines and wait times during voting periods. For example, after Maricopa County, Arizona, reduced its number of polling places by 70 percent during the 2016 primary, voters were forced to wait in line for up to five hours.173 A study from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies reported that long lines were estimated to have deterred at least 730,000 Americans from voting in the 2012 elections.174 That year, more than 5 million Americans experienced polling place wait times of at least one hour.175 Furthermore, according to a nationwide study, in 2016, roughly 3 percent of people standing in line at voting locations left before they could vote as a result of long lines.176\n2. Public distrust and alienation lead to a vicious cycle of bad government representation. According to a 2016 survey, 57 percent of Americans agreed that \u201cpolitics and elections are controlled by people with money and by big corporations so it doesn\u2019t matter if they vote.\u201d246 A 2018 survey by Suffolk University found that 68 percent of unregistered and registered but disengaged voters agree with the statement, \u201cI don\u2019t pay much attention to politics because it is so corrupt.\u201d247 If people do not trust democratic institutions or understand political processes, they will not show up to the polls\u2014a place where they could contribute to removing bad actors from office and electing responsive representatives. A 2018 study by Harvard University found that only 36 percent of young respondents disagreed with the statement, \u201cPolitical involvement rarely has any tangible results.\u201d248\n3. Almost 92 million eligible Americans did not vote in the 2016 presidential elections.1 In the 2014 midterm elections, an estimated 143 million eligible Americans failed to vote, marking the lowest voter participation in 72 years.2 For the nation\u2019s democracy to function properly and for government to provide fair representation, all eligible Americans must have the opportunity to vote\u2014and be encouraged to do so. Our collective self-rule is established and fostered through free, fair, accessible, and secure elections through which the voice of every eligible American is heard.\n4. In the same way that partisan interests and those in power have used voting rights laws and policies to suppress the vote, they also have attempted to use the U.S. Census and the subsequent congressional redistricting process to advance their political goals. The Trump administration, for example, fought unsuccessfully for two years to add a question to the 2020 census asking if someone is a citizen of the United States. Voting rights and civil rights groups said this was a transparent attempt to instill fear in immigrant communities, with the result of undercounting the immigrant population and reducing its political power and voice. Other concerns about the 2020 census include chronic underfunding for the work of accurately counting everyone in the nation. To the extent that the census cuts corners, there is a well-founded belief that it will result in an undercount of already underrepresented populations, including low-income populations and people of color.\n5. These activities have a demonstrable and disproportionate effect on populations that are already underrepresented at the polls. Adding to the problems, government at all levels has largely failed to make the necessary investments in elections (from technology to poll-worker training) to ensure the integrity and efficiency of the system.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

ELI5: Why are the question mark, exclamation mark, and period nearly universal in foreign languages?\n2. In Japanese, periods are open circles rather than a solid dot, commas are slanted the opposite way from English, and quotations are enclosed in corner-brackets. In addition, there are no spaces in written Japanese. As for question marks, these are not used outside of informal text messages, the internet, or letter writing between friends. While Chinese, Japanese, and Korean all use Western punctuation, it was only adopted by all three countries in the early 20th century.\n3. The same goes for the question mark. While its spread and adoption are not a result of an international legislative process, its use is a result of the spread of Latin orthography in the colonial era - as is the whole idea of punctuation. As a result some marking of questions (and ends of sentences, etc.) has now entered many orthographies including the non-Latin ones (like Chinese) that never previously had them. Of course, we know that punctuation (or even spaces between words) did not arise naturally in all orthographies and it took a good thousand years for them to appear in Latin and Greek alphabetic writing and another half a millennium to achieve some sort of standardization.\n4. Question marks are not universal as is not any punctuation or orthography. In fact, the term universal is generally applied to features of language that arise 'organically' - that is without specific intervention (although the level of intervention in all language change is probably greater than the word 'organic' implies). So it makes no sense to ask is the traffic stop sign universal because it emerged through an explicit policy context. However, you can ask things like 'is the traffic stop sign' used the same way in all countries, do drivers interpret in the same way?\n5. One language that\u2019s notable for its out-of-the-ordinary usage of the question mark is Spanish, which adds a second symbol to the beginning of the phrase, flips it upside down and uses it with the first ordinary question mark to bookend an interrogative phrase. In practice, this looks like \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1n los ni\u00f1os?, or \u201cWhere are the children?\u201d This rule also applies to exclamation marks, so you can express excitement with a phrase like \u00a1Dios m\u00edo!, or \u201cMy God!\u201d.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

We all know the feeling of scrambling at the last minute to finish a task that we could have and should have tackled much sooner. Fuschia Sirois, PhD, of Durham University, talks about why procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not one of laziness or poor time management skills; how it can harm our mental and physical health; why it\u2019s so tied up with guilt and shame; and how self-compassion can help us overcome it.\n3. One of the biggest factors contributing to procrastination is the notion that we have to feel inspired or motivated to work on a task at a particular moment.\n4. We must realize that, at its core, procrastination is about emotions, not productivity. The solution doesn\u2019t involve downloading a time management app or learning new strategies for self-control. It has to do with managing our emotions in a new way.\n5.

Censorship by religion is a form of censorship where freedom of expression is controlled or limited using religious authority or on the basis of the teachings of the religion. This form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the Galileo affair, Edict of Compi\u00e8gne, the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of Salman Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Images of the Islamic figure Muhammad are also regularly censored. In some secular countries, this is sometimes done to prevent hurting religious sentiments.\n2. Censorship has been criticized throughout history for being unfair and hindering progress. In a 1997 essay on Internet censorship, social commentator Michael Landier claims that censorship is counterproductive as it prevents the censored topic from being discussed. Landier expands his argument by claiming that those who impose censorship must consider what they censor to be true, as individuals believing themselves to be correct would welcome the opportunity to disprove those with opposing views.\n3. - \"The objectionable material may be considered immoral or obscene, heretical or blasphemous, seditious or treasonable, or injurious to the national security. Thus, the rationale for censorship is that it is necessary for the protection of three basic social institutions: the family, the church, and the state.\"\n4. - \"Censorship operates on the assumption that the thoughts, feelings, opinions, beliefs and fantasies of human beings ought to be a subject of moral judgment and ultimately social and government action.\"\n5. Today's calls for censorship are not motivated solely by morality and taste, but also by the widespread belief that exposure to images of violence causes people to act in destructive ways. Pro-censorship forces, including many politicians, often cite a multitude of \"scientific studies\" that allegedly prove fictional violence leads to real-life violence.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. An inductor is about as simple as an electronic component can get; basically it is a coil of copper magnetic wire. It turns out however, that a coil of wire can do some very interesting things primarily due to the electrically driven magnetic properties of a coil of copper wire.\n2. Ideally, an inductor should have only the function of inductance, but in reality, it has internal and terminal resistance, and it also has distribution capacitance and other characteristics that cause the coils to act as the electrodes of a capacitor.\n3. An inductor is a passive electronic component that temporarily stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through the inductor's coil. In its simplest form, an inductor consists of two terminals and an insulated wire coil that either loops around air or surrounds a core material that enhances the magnetic field. Inductors help to handle fluctuations in an electric current running through a circuit.\n4. Many factors can affect an inductor's level of inductance, including the number of coils, the length of the coiled wire, the material used for the core, and the size and shape of the core. If no core is used, then inductance also depends on the radius of the coil.\n5. As the name suggests, an \u201cAir core\u201d inductor requires no coil form but is self-supporting. It leverages air as a medium to store magnetic energy rather than utilizing a magnetic material such as ferrite. In some cases, inductors with an air core can be wound so that the coil can be able to support itself, whereas in other cases, a ceramic or insulated material may be employed to provide structure. Furthermore, to stabilize the inductance of this inductor, it can be dipped into varnish or secured by wax.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

For Christians who hold to this view, saying that \"Jesus died for our sins\" means that in dying on the cross, Jesus fully paid the penalty or price due to us for our sins, and thus satisfied God's justice, or wrath, so that we would not have to suffer the eternal penalty for our sin.\n2. For Christians who hold to this view, saying that \"Jesus died for our sins\" means that Jesus took on himself the brunt of the attacks of all the powers of evil that had built up due to human sin and evil, suffering and dying on the cross due to their onslaught, but in the process emerged victorious and subjected hell and the Devil to his authority. Thus he took to himself the power to save us from sin, hell, the Devil, and spiritual death.\n3. For Christians who hold to this view, saying that \"Jesus died for our sins\" means that Jesus gave God such great honor by his death on the cross that the surplus honor satisfies the deficit of honor created by our sins. So Christ satisfied the debt of honor to God created by our sin, thus providing an alternative to our being eternally punished for our sins.\n4. For those Christians who hold to this view, saying that \"Jesus died for our sins\" means that in dying on the Cross, Jesus paid the ransom due to the Devil, or to God the Father, required because our inherited sin had put us in the bondage to the Devil ever since the Fall of Mankind described in Genesis 3.\n5. I believe when it says Jesus died for our sins, it means that he has saved human beings from physical death. It is often said that death is a consequence of sin, and when Jesus died on the cross he defeated sin, therefore death was defeated.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Nerves in teeth do not regenerate in a state where they have been cut off. As a result, damage to the nerves means that if one or more teeth are affected, the nerve needs to be regenerated. Sometimes this requires multiple procedures before a nerve is actually regenerated to the point where it can take up its normal function again. When a tooth is gummed up by bacteria and cannot receive adequate blood flow, the nerves that normally run through the gum will go dormant. The nerve will not receive any more blood flow, and it will be like an almost dead branch of a tree; the tree will slowly wither away, leaving no other function. A nerve cannot survive without blood to supply it. Hence, the nerves need to be cleaned out so that they can be functioning again.\n2. A tooth with no nerve inside it is a dead tooth. The nerves inside the teeth are the ones responsible for letting us know whether an ice cream is cold or our coffee is hot. Some people falsely believe that having no nerve in a tooth instantly means that they are completely free from toothaches. Although it is true that the tooth can no longer sense cold and hot anymore, not all is gone. You see, there is little space left in the middle of the tooth that contains dead tissue, which can set the table to numerous bacteria to feast and lead to serious tooth infection within the tooth.\n3. Once a nerve inside a tooth dies, your immune system recognises dead tissue as foreign body and starts various defence mechanisms to get rid of it. This is when an inflammation begins forming around the root of this tooth, which is a very complex process that involves different cells and substances sending the brain signals that something is wrong; hence, the pain. Remember, pain is your body\u2019s normal reaction to protect you.\n4. Dentinal sensitivity is nerve pain in the teeth which is more widespread. This nerve pain in your teeth occurs when your enamel is eroded or damaged, and external stimuli such as cold, heat, and acid reach the nerve endings in the dentin layer of your tooth.\n5. If your nerve pain focuses on one of your teeth, the problem will likely affect the pulp.

The browser emphasizes geometric precision over rendering speed and legibility. Certain aspects of fonts \u2014 such as kerning \u2014 don't scale linearly. So this value can make text using those fonts look good.\n2. However with fonts detail is very important, and so historically font rendering has been extremely complicated because you want to retain details even at low resolutions. While an outline of a spline has perfect curvature and resolution, our screens deals with discrete samples called pixels which poses a problem. Various workarounds have been invented, such as antialising/multisampling, font hinting and clamping glyph positions to whole pixels. They all have advantages and disadvantages. Just doing multisampling makes glyphs in lower resolution look muddy and blurry. Font hinting is a huge hack that makes the serifs and stems pop out. And just clamping to the nearest pixel messes up the spacing between the characters, but it does make the overall text sharper since you don't get pixel centers in-between pixels in the destination grid.\n3. As we discussed in our post on \"10 Website Speed Test Tools for Analyzing Web Performance,\" CSS is by default treated as a render blocking resource. And since you are calling your web fonts with a CSS3 `@font` declaration this automatically means that web fonts can also be render blocking, keeping your page from loading as quickly as it could.\n4. On Windows XP, text is rendered as grayscale by many browsers. Although not as crisp as the subpixel rendering used by Mac OS, the letters are nicely smoothed and look great in large sizes.\n5. The number of websites using custom web fonts continues to grow at a rapid pace and this, in turn, affects the rendering speed of pages.

Following the experiment, the magazine concluded that the soups and stews that had milk or cream experienced a breakdown of lactose into glucose, which tasted sweeter with time. Meanwhile, proteins in the meat converted into individual amino acids that acted as \u201cflavor enhancers,\u201d and the starches present in both flour and potatoes broke down into compounds that people reported as more flavorful. Another key to great leftovers may lie in aromatic flavors, such as garlic and ginger, which develop more fully over time.\n2. Actually, I\u2019m a fan of \u2018next day\u2019 casseroles, stews, and soups too. As well as feeling the inevitable smugness of one whose meal is already prepared, I think many leftovers tend to taste better than than the original meal.\n3. The strange truth about leftovers is that they often taste better the next day. It seems counterintuitive: One would think that food tastes best when it\u2019s most fresh. But try telling that to fans of leftovers as varied as chili, curry, and cold lasagna. Is the perceived superiority all in our heads? Or is something more scientific afoot?\n4. Chef J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt decided to taste test some of his very own recipes on different days and compare (via Serious Eats). While L\u00f3pez-Alt found no significant difference in the beef stew, he believed his tomato soup and chili lost their marked flavor notes: he was not able to spot the individual spices in his leftover taste tests. Sure enough, Dr. Shelke confirms this suspicion stating that on day one of making a recipe, your taste buds may be able to detect individual flavors, and even though you can taste these flavors in leftover portions, they are \"much less pronounced and the dish is therefore more mellow or rounded in flavor\" (per Forbes). As to which day your food tastes best, it all depends on the amount of flavor development you want in your home-cooked meals.\n5. Yet something else we often don\u2019t consider is that food continues to undergo chemical reactions even after the cooking\u2019s done. Cook\u2019s Illustrated conducted an experiment to try and understand why some food flavors notably improved overnight. They served tomato soup, beef chili, and French onion soup to several testers. Every taste tester held that the two-day-old soups and stews were \u201csweeter,\u201d \u201cmore robust-tasting,\u201d and \u201cwell rounded.\u201d Yet the response to the chili was mixed, and some testers reported that flavors weren\u2019t as pronounced after several days.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

For more information about silent letters in English, see my reference page, \u201cOrigin of Silent Letters.\u201d Feel free to contact me with questions as well.\n3. Silent letters appeared in English as the result of three main factors. First, as the language propagated across regions and continents, varying accents and cultures modified the pronunciation of certain words and specific clusters of consonants. At least one of the consonants in such a cluster was relegated to become a silent letter. Second, the expansion of the English Empire led to the \u201cborrowing\u201d of many words from a variety of languages. These words tended to retain their original spellings, or in cases when a corresponding letter did not exist, imperfect substitutes were used. These imperfect substitutes were an amalgamation of existing English letters, but were pronounced very differently. This led to some letters in these amalgamations being silent. Finally, there have been instances where silent letters were specifically introduced as aids to differentiate between two homophones or to provide guidance on the pronunciation of certain words.\n4. A silent letter is a letter that isn\u2019t heard when a particular word is pronounced. Think of the \u201cb\u201d in subtle, the \u201ca\u201d in bread, and the \u201ch,\u201d in ghost. Almost every word in the alphabet plays the role of a silent letter in at least one word.\n5. The last group of silent letters we\u2019ll talk about came from some misguided spelling reforms. We\u2019ve been talking about how silent letters can result from not removing a letter that represents a sound that isn\u2019t pronounced. However, in some cases, a silent letter has come from putting in a letter for a sound that isn\u2019t pronounced!\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The cells that make the hairs on your arms are programmed to stop growing every couple of months, so the hair on your arms stays short.

With body hair, which typically does not grow as long as head hair, the rate at which it falls out is greater. This results in hair that appears to reach a certain length then stops growing.\n3.

The difference in light and dark roast coffees as it pertains to caffeine, in other words, is small.\n2. Because light roast coffee is roasted for less time, it\u2019s denser and heavier than dark roast. As a result, each particle of ground light roast contains more caffeine than a particle of ground dark roast. When equal volumes are measured, the light roast will thus pack more caffeine.\n3. Light coffee is roasted for less time, it\u2019s denser and heavier than dark roast beans, which lose more water during the process and will weigh less. Therefore, each particle of ground light roast ends up containing more caffeine than a particle of ground dark roast.\n4. There has been ado about how dark roast coffee actually have less caffeine content than light roasts. The thought process is that caffeine begins to burn off during the roasting process, but caffeine burns off at a high temperature than most roasters roast their beans in the first place. Cambio\u2019s dark roast K-Cups\u00ae have a higher number of grams, which means the caffeine profiles of our roasts are fairly similar.\n5.

Many alphabets - for example, Gujarati, Hebrew, Tamil - don't distinguish between upper and lower case letters. Why does the Latin alphabet?\n2. It\u2019s worth pointing out that uppercase and lowercase characters are mostly a quirk of the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets. While these alphabets probably make up a plurality of written texts, many languages especially in Asia do not use these, and thus have no such uppercase/lowercase distinction.\n3. Alternately, some languages don't use case the same way English does. Klingon (a constructed language) uses the letters `q` and `Q` for two different sounds, so swapping one for the other can create a different word. In Cherokee, the letters `\u13bb` and `\u13c2` are similarly unrelated. And the IPA distinguishes `r` from `\u0280`, among others (and so do systems based on it, like the standard transliteration of Old Norse). But none of these systems really has casing the way English and German do: there's no systematic correspondence between \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase\" letters in any of them, just symbols that happen to resemble English \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase\" for historical reasons.\n4. The question is interesting, but I would reverse it: Why does English have lower-case letters? Most of the letters used in English derive from the Roman alphabet, which was entirely upper case. (The terms upper case and lower case derive from movable-type printing, and refer to the physical location of the racks\u2014cases\u2014where each set of type was located.) Lower-case letters derive from script, and predate printing.\n5. Second, some languages may use symbols that resemble what in other languages might be uppercase/lowercase letters, but in this language actually represent different sounds or concepts altogether. Take, for example, Cyrillic \u0412 and \u042c, which visually resemble Latin uppercase and lowercase B/b, but are two distinct letters with distinct and different pronunciations \u2013 and each have a distinct uppercase and lowercase form themselves. A similar example that has been pointed out in another answer is Klingon, where no uppercase/lowercase distinction is made (although the writing system is based on the Latin alphabet), and where q and Q are distinct letters.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

While an hour of playing can be beneficial, three or more hours at one sitting will lose those benefits. In addition to increasing the risk of computer eye syndrome, excessive video game use can cause eye discomfort, focusing problems, blurry vision and headaches. It\u2019s so easy to get completely immersed in a game to forget to take breaks, and many games require complete focus. Moderation in use is often easier said than done.\n2. If you work in front of a computer all day, or spend a lot of time watching tv and playing video games, you might have noticed your eyesight getting a bit blurry. This is due to a condition known as Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS), a group of eye and vision-related issues that are the result of too much screen time. The good news is CVS is not permanent and there are many things you can do to help prevent it.\n3. Playing video games can affect vision. Gaming for a long time can lead to eye strain, eye irritation, and even computer vision syndrome.\n4. Individuals who spend a lot of time on a computer or other screens can develop specific problems with their eyesight, and in some cases, a condition called computer vision syndrome (CVS).\n5. If your eyes hurt from playing video games, you might also have problems focusing your eyes. When looking at a screen, the eyes constantly change focus, making them very tired.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

For the Greeks,  all people can and do communicate with a god or gods; these gods exist very much in the real world, taking on the shape of humans (or even animals), and even often having sexual relations with humans etc.. These gods have a physicality that is increasingly missing in the OT god (and then returned in the NT god Jesus), and this physicality reinforces the belief that human physical qualities are themselves an element of the divine. If the gods look like us, then we look like the gods; thus, our bodies are godly.\n2. Polytheistic Greek religion encompassed a myriad of gods, each representing a certain facet of the human condition, and even abstract ideas such as justice and wisdom could have their own personification. The most important gods, though, were the Olympian gods led by Zeus:\n3. In the Greek imagination, literature, and art, the gods were given human bodies and characters - both good and bad - and just as ordinary men and women, they married, had children (often through illicit affairs), fought, and in the stories of Greek mythology they directly intervened in human affairs. These traditions were first recounted only orally as there was no sacred text in Greek religion and later, attempts were made to put in writing this oral tradition, notably by Hesiod in his Theogony and more indirectly in the works of Homer.\n4. Such beliefs and, indeed, certain aspects of religion such as the immorality of the gods as portrayed in the arts, were severely criticised by intellectuals, artists, and philosophers from the 5th century BCE, but these may or may not reflect the commonly held views of the wider populace, and it is difficult to believe from the wealth of archaeological and written records that religion was anything but a fundamental part of life for the ordinary inhabitants of the ancient Greek world.\n5.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Once most of the alcohol is absorbed, the rest is excreted from your body through your stool and urine. Your colon muscles move in a coordinated squeeze to push the stool out.\n2. Alcohol speeds up the rate of these squeezes, which doesn\u2019t allow for water to be absorbed by your colon as it is normally. This causes your stool to come out as diarrhea, often very quickly and with a lot of extra water.\n3. If you like absolute answers, you\u2019ll be disappointed to read water absorption rates vary. Some water is absorbed within seconds to minutes from the mouth and stomach. After that, the sooner water is emptied from the stomach, the faster it is absorbed, since the maximum rate of absorption occurs in the small intestine. How fast the stomach empties depends on the temp of the water, with cooler water emptying out more quickly. Absorption of water also varies depending on your level of hydration. And there seems to be mystical genetic factor as well.\n4. Fluids in the diet are generally absorbed in the proximal small intestine, and absorption rate is determined by the rate of gastric emptying to the small intestine. Therefore, the total volume of fluid consumed will eventually be reflected in water balance, but the rate at which rehydration occurs is dependent upon factors which affect the rate of delivery of fluids to the intestinal mucosa. Gastric emptying rate is generally accelerated by the total volume consumed and slowed by higher energy density and osmolality.68 In addition to water consumed in food (1 L/d) and beverages (~2\u20133 L/d), digestive secretions account for a far greater portion of water that passes through and is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract (~8 L/d).69 The majority of this water is absorbed by the small intestine, with a capacity of up to 15 L/d with the colon absorbing some 5 L/d.69\n5. No, you don't absorb water right after drinking it\u2014but it's quicker than you think.
