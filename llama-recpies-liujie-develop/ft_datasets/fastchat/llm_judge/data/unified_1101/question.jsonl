Depending on how old you are, you may be breaking the law. According to city laws in towns across the U.S., some candy-grubbers might have to sit out on the festivities because of their age. Multiple cities have placed an age limit on trick-or-treating. According to Section 46-8 of the Chesapeake, Virginia municipal code, any person over the age of 14 is prohibited from the activity. Breaking this code is a Class 4 misdemeanor, and could result in a $250 fine.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 02:57AM\nGiven a question from a Los Angeles, California user: TV series premiering this fall near Los Angeles, California\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: The Top 5 Spooky TV Show Filming Locations in California\ndate: 2023-10-20\nbody: The weird and scary are nothing new in California, which has a long history in the film industry. As a result of the numerous television productions that have taken place there over the years, many of its locations have come to be associated with famous spooky scenes. Discover the top five spooky TV show filming places in the Golden State that you should dare to visit as Halloween approaches. THE BATES MOTEL \u2013 UNIVERSAL STUDIOS, LOS ANGELES The Bates Motel from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s classic Psycho and its following TV adaptations stands tall within Universal Studios and is arguably one of the most recognisable eerie sets in television history. Even though the fa\u00e7ade is a part of a theme park and is frequently crowded with delighted tourists, the location is inexplicably eerie, especially if you are aware of its tragic history. The motel is overlooked by the nearby Bates house, which adds to the eerie mood. For every horror fan, it is a must-see. MURDER HOUSE \u2013 ROSENHEIM MANSION, LOS ANGELES The Rosenheim Mansion is immediately recognisable to viewers of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d as the famed \u201cMurder House\u201d from the first season. The mansion itself was constructed in the early 1900s and is a fusion of Gothic and Romanesque revival styles. With its stained-glass windows, wood panelling, and towers, it emanates an old-world charm. But because of the series, it has an unsettling undertone that draws people looking for the thrill of the unknown. SANTA CARLA BOARDWALK \u2013 SANTA CRUZ BEACH BOARDWALK Despite being only a movie, \u201cThe Lost Boys\u201d has developed a cult following and an image that has impacted several TV shows. The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, which served as a stand-in for the imagined Santa Carla Boardwalk, is particularly unsettling at night. One is compelled to think of the vampire-filled sequences from the cult film when one sees the funfair lights and never-ending sounds of the ocean in the background. It\u2019s a visit that is both nostalgic and eerie. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL \u2013 TORRANCE HIGH SCHOOL, TORRANCE Although Buffy the Vampire Slayer blended teen drama and horror, at times the show\u2019s settings were genuinely creepy. Sunnydale High in the series was based on Torrance High School. Despite being a working school, the structure has a creepy atmosphere thanks to its early 20th-century architecture and TV past, especially if you visit after hours or during a break in classes. Just be mindful of the surroundings. CAMP REDWOOD \u2013 FRANKLIN CANYON PARK, BEVERLY HILLS Franklin Canyon Park served as the location for the Camp Redwood scenes from the \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d season \u201c198\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Amazon\u2019s Fallout TV show is set in Los Angeles, which is suspiciously close to New Vegas\ndate: 2023-08-23\nbody: It is frankly baffling how little has been released about the forthcoming Fallout TV series premiering on Prime Video next year, with a lot of fundamental questions basically unanswered beyond the fact that it will be telling an original story set in and around Vault 33, a retro-future nuclear fallout shelter much like the ones every Fallout game begins in. Today we got a new tidbit, with Prime Video\u2019s social media accounts sharing the tiniest of updates: Vault 33, and Fallout, will be set in Los Angeles, and it will premiere in 2024. Out of context this does not seem terribly remarkable \u2014 most TV shows are shot in LA. How convenient that this one will also be set there! However, when it comes to Fallout, there\u2019s some interesting implications to the locale. First, Los Angeles is kind of close to Las Vegas, the setting of Fallout: New Vegas, the best Fallout game. Maybe, just maybe, that game will get some kind of shoutout, or serve as a primary text for the adaptation. Setting the show in southern California also means that the Fallout games\u2019 New California Republic might show up, a faction of the franchise\u2019s post-apocalyptic wastelanders attempting to restore the pre-war way of life. While less flashy than the armor-clad Brotherhood of Steel, the NCR is one of the more politically interesting factions in Fallout; at their best, they can be a vehicle for exploring the notion of \u201ccivilization\u201d as a tool of empire, and a way old power structures look to re-assert themselves in new contexts. Which is the sort of thing that could make for good TV. Fallout is coming to Prime Video in 2024.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Private Party Ideas for the Fall Season in Los Angeles\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: *SPONSORED* Fall has arrived in Los Angeles, bringing sunny and enjoyable weather, even in the changing seasons.

And if you love a good cocktail/beer, watching sports, relaxing by the pool, or fun festive parties, Los Angeles is the best place to host these epic adventures. Halloween Private Parties in Los Angeles One of the best ways to celebrate the spooky season is by throwing a private Halloween party. An exclusive affair like this lets your guests get creative with their costumes and create memorable moments. To make your Halloween private party more lively, consider making it adults only and allow yourself to unwind while everyone lets their inhibitions go. It is no secret that Los Angeles is home to some of the world\u2019s most beautiful women. You can even book some of them to come to your private party. This popular personal party service in Los Angeles is notoriously a rite of passage for bachelor parties. However, it is not limited to bachelor parties. You can also spice up your Halloween gathering by booking these local smokeshows. Even better, they come with both tricks and treats: On Halloween, there are no holds barred, so you can have your girls any way you want them. Bad girls love making dreams a reality. So they will come as whatever you like\u2014 Sexy nurses? Naughty Barbie? Dirty House Maids? Playboy Bunnies? Or you leave it up to us, and Bad Girls will surprise you with teeny tiny costumes of their choosing. Bad Girls don\u2019t just attend private parties\u2014They are about creating an interactive, unforgettable experience with party games such as whipped cream races or stripper darts\u2014 adding a sexy edge to the party. You can book this service for your private party in various locations, including hotel suites, AirBnB\u2019s, mansions, or your place. Depending on your guests\u2019 preferences, the themed party girls can perform a more mild PG-rated show for everyone, or if everyone likes to live on the edge, they also offer a wild girl-on-girl strip show. Private Party in the Water If you\u2019re planning your private party at the start of fall, consider hosting it by the pool. Los Angeles is home to some of the most remarkable mansions, fully equipped with luxurious pools to spend time by (some even have the option to be heated). We highly recommend researching and finding a party-friendly mansion with the option to throw a pool party, especially\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Kate Hudson\u2019s Classic Knit Is the Only Thing I Want to Bundle Up in This Fall\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: I\u2019m happy to report that the temperature has finally (if just for a moment) dropped in Los Angeles. Over the Halloween weekend, I was greeted by chilly winds and weather that had me digging through my pile of knits, only to discover that between closet cleanouts and moves I had lost a few staple pieces \u2014 including a style Kate Hudson wore last week. When the actress took to Instagram a few days ago, she shared a festive martini and a perfect fall sweater. Her oversized turtleneck screamed autumn, from the squash color to the English ribbing, and made me crave weather I could bundle up in. So with this weekend\u2019s weather granting that wish (and my closet in dire need of a timeless turtleneck) I set out to find styles similar to Hudson\u2019s, and discovered seven sweaters you can grab today starting at just $18. The Drop Side-Button Cropped Turtleneck Sweater, $18 (Originally $45); amazon.com Treasure & Bond Turtleneck Sweater, $38 (Originally $59); nordstrom.com Saodimallsu Oversized Turtleneck Sweater, $39; amazon.com Anrabess Oversized Turtleneck Sweater, $43 (Originally $60); amazon.com Lillusory Oversized Turtleneck Sweater, $43 (Originally $60); amazon.com Madewell Wide Rib Turtleneck Sweater, $98; madewell.com Nordstrom Cashmere Turtleneck Sweater, $125 (Originally $169); nordstrom.com Anrabess Oversized Turtleneck Sweater Anrabess\u2019 turtleneck is a dead ringer for Hudson\u2019s, with the same oversized fit, dropped shoulders, and classic autumnal shade (though it\u2019s also available in 31 other colors). Plus, this pick is adored by more than 2,400 Amazon shoppers, who say that the on-sale sweater is \u201cfashion-forward and cozy.\u201d \u201cThis sweater looks great and is versatile in my wardrobe,\u201d wrote one fan, explaining that \u201cit can look dressy or casual.\u201d Others were impressed by the quality, saying that it \u201clooks much more expensive than it is\u201d and feels \u201cextremely comfortable.\u201d \u201c[It\u2019s] not itchy and very flattering,\u201d they wrote. And per another customer, \u201cthis sweater feels like butter.\u201d Treasure & Bond Turtleneck Sweater Over at Nordstrom, Treasure & Bond\u2019s cotton-blend turtleneck sweater is on sale for just $38. This is a loose sweater \u2014 a little less chunky than Hudson\u2019s \u2014 and features ribbed details at the neck, sleeves, and hem.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) slammed the United Nations, calling it \u201cthe most anti-Semitic body on the planet\u201d after the U.N. General Assembly called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas War. On Monday\u2019s Hannity , Graham recounted in graphic terms the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel in which 1,400 people were killed and more than 200 were abducted. In response, Israel has waged an air and ground campaign against Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. The ongoing war has prompted concerns about massive civilian casualties in the small, but densely populated area of 2.3 million people, roughly half of whom are children. \u201cHamas outdid the Nazis,\u201d Graham said of Oct. 7.

The United Nations General Assembly convened to address the situation in Israel and Gaza The resolution, initiated by Jordan and backed by over 40 UN member states, comes after unsuccessful attempts at the Security Council to negotiate \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d and an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d Since the Security Council\u2019s efforts fell short, attention shifted to the United Nations General Assembly, comprising 193 member states where each holds a vote without the power of veto. While these resolutions are not legally binding, they serve as a significant indicator of global sentiment. It was evident that a vast majority of member states favored an immediate humanitarian truce. The process commenced with a Canadian proposal to include a direct condemnation of Hamas\u2019 October 7 terrorist attack within the Jordanian draft. This addition was insisted upon by Canada, the United\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Explainer: What is a UN General Assembly emergency special session and why it matters\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: As the UN\u2019s 193 Member States meet on how to address the ongoing Israel-Palestine crisis, we took a look at how the current rarely convened General Assembly emergency special session came about, what it means and why it matters. What\u2019s an emergency special session? When the UN Security Council is unable to shoulder its primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security, as has thus far been the case following the 7 October outbreak of the latest Israel-Palestine crisis, the General Assembly can consider the matter immediately in an emergency special session. UN Member States can request the Assembly President to convene such a session, with a view to making appropriate recommendations for collective measures, including calling for ceasefires, and in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression, as a last resort, the use of armed force when necessary. At the first plenary meeting of an emergency special session or upon its resumption, as is the case with the current tenth session, the Assembly typically hears\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: United Nations Day, 2023\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Proclamation 10657 of October 23, 2023 United Nations Day, 2023 A Proclamation Seventy-seven years ago, leaders from around the globe gathered for the first United Nations General Assembly.

This United Nations Day, we renew our commitment to sustaining and strengthening those institutions. As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, may we live up to its fundamental promise by continuing to advance the causes of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.

The event comes at a critical time for the Earth, which is facing a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. Past assemblies have played a pivotal role in shaping global environmental policy, and UNEA-6 is set to follow suit. We spoke with Radhika Ochalik, Director of the Governance Affairs Office at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), to find out more about UNEA-6 and how it can help humanity make peace with nature.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, canceled plans to hold its 29th annual banquet on Saturday at the Marriott Crystal Gateway in Arlington, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. The group, which has used the hotel for a decade, will move the banquet to an undisclosed location with heightened security, the group's statement said. \"In recent days, according to the Marriott, anonymous callers have threatened to plant bombs in the hotel's parking garage, kill specific hotel staff in their homes, and storm the hotel in a repeat of the Jan. 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol if the events moved forward,\" the statement said. Arlington police said in an email that the department was investigating a Thursday morning report from the hotel that it received anonymous phone calls, \"some referencing threats to bomb,\" regarding the CAIR event. Emails seeking comment from the FBI, which CAIR said also is investigating, and the Marriott hotel chain were not immediately answered late Thursday night. A separate banquet planned for Oct. 28 in Maryland also was cancelled and will be merged with Saturday's event, CAIR said. The threats came after CAIR updated banquet programming to focus on human rights issues for Palestinians. The group has started an online campaign urging members of Congress to promote a ceasefire in Gaza. \"We strongly condemn the extreme and disgusting threats against our organization, the Marriott hotel and its staff,\" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad, who is Palestinian American, said in a statement. \"We will not allow the threats of anti-Palestinian racists and anti-Muslim bigots who seek to dehumanize the Palestinian people and silence American Muslims to stop us from pursuing justice for all.\" Hamas militants from the blockaded Gaza Strip stormed into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7, which coincided with a major Jewish holiday. The attack killed hundreds of civilians. Since then, Israel has launched airstrikes on Gaza, destroying entire neighborhoods and killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians. There have been concerns the\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Congress must pass legislation to help protect Americans from unmanned aircraft systems\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: As the New England Patriots were preparing to win their sixth Super Bowl title, high above Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta a different face-off was taking place. During Super Bowl LIII\u2019s pregame flyover, members of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team avoided a mid-air collision with an unauthorized drone operating in restricted airspace. Thankfully, the FBI\u2019s counter-unmanned aircraft system, or \u201cC-UAS,\u201d team successfully detected the intrusion and provided advance warning to the F-16s overhead, averting catastrophe and potential loss of life. But instances of unauthorized drone use have risen steadily, and close calls like this are becoming all too commonplace. This challenge isn\u2019t limited to sporting events. Since 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration reported dozens of airport disruptions caused by drones that required commercial flights to be held, delayed, modified or rerouted. On a few occasions, air traffic controllers issued a full ground stop , effectively stopping all departures and leaving passengers delayed and frustrated. Meanwhile, in just a single week this past June, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials seized 27 pounds of narcotics ferried by criminal organizations using drones. In short, while there is a wide array of legitimate drone use that can provide us with benefits and entertainment, a rise in both harmful and negligent drone use threatens the public safety and security of our nation. The three of us experience this every day as we fulfill our missions: for one of us, to protect the Homeland; for two of us, to protect Americans as they pack MLB and NFL stadiums nationwide; and for all of us, to keep Americans safe. In doing so, the U.S. government relies on critical authorities for countering these threats, but these authorities are going to expire next month, ahead of Thanksgiving \u2014 unless Congress acts. Failure to do so would pose a major danger to the American public by dramatically reducing the federal government\u2019s ability to detect, locate and respond to drone threats. The Biden administration has identified existing legislative and policy gaps that impede the government\u2019s ability to protect the American people from drone-related threats and raised them as a matter of urgency. That includes issuing the country\u2019s first-ever \u201c Domestic Counter-UAS National Action Plan \u201d in April 2022. The plan includes, as an essential element, a legislative\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: October Current Events 2023: U.S. News\ndate: 2023-10-06\nbody: World News | Disaster News | Science & Technology News | Current Events This Week The world is a very busy place, and it's hard to stay on top of everything. Infoplease has got you covered. Here are the U.S. news events you need to know so far for October 2023. Congress Of The United States Pass Bill Which Avoids Shutdown Photo Source: AP Photo/Senate Television Sunday, October 1, 2023 \u2013 The Government of the United States has avoided a federal shutdown after both the House and Senate agreed on a short-term funding deal. The bill which will ensure funding received overwhelming support and was signed into law by the President, Joe Biden before the deadline. Most of the lawmakers were eager to avert the shutdown. The bill was backed by more Democrats than Republicans, with as many as 90 House Republicans voting against the bill. The passage of the bill landed a blow to a small group of right-wing Republicans who have held up negotiations in the chamber for with unyielding demands for spending cuts and no new aid for Ukraine. Shutdowns occur when both chambers of Congress are unable to agree on the roughly 30% of federal spending they must approve before the start of each fiscal year on the 1st of October. Source: BBC Probe Into Ford SUVs Concerning Engine Failure Expanded By The United States Photo Source: AP Photo/David Zalubowski Monday, October 2, 2023 \u2013 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirmed on Monday that it would upgrade and expand its investigation into 708,000 Ford Motor (F.N). sport utility vehicles and trucks concerning the catastrophic engine failures associated with its valves. The investigation is focused on 2021 and 2022 model year Ford Bronco, Edge, Explorer, and F-150 and Lincoln Aviator and Nautilus vehicles. A preliminary evaluation of 25,000 vehicles began in July 2022, after opening a defect petition review in May, following a request from a couple of owners. NHTSA confirmed that the analysis of the data that was released by Ford showed that \u201cthe alleged defect is present across the Nano engine family, which includes both 2.7L and 3.0L EcoBoost engine variants. Ford said the valves were manufactured out of an alloy known as Silchrome\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Janet Yellen to deliver major speech detailing US economic strategy toward Indo-Pacific\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: New York (CNN) \u2014 At a moment of elevated geopolitical danger, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to deliver a major speech on Thursday mapping out the Biden administration\u2019s economic gameplan toward the increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific region, CNN has learned. The speech will mark the first time the Biden administration has outlined its economic approach toward the region in such detail. The Yellen remarks come ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers\u2019 meeting later in November and a potential high-stakes summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco. A Treasury official tells CNN that Yellen, who visited Beijing over the summer, plans to use the speech on Thursday to emphasize that deeper economic ties with the Indo-Pacific will serve three key objectives: Strengthen US national security, benefit US communities and fuel growth across the region. Even as the world\u2019s attention is on the violence in the Middle East, tensions between China and its neighbors have been on the rise. Recently, China and the Philippines accused each other of causing collisions in a disputed area of the South China Sea. During the speech before the Asia Society, Yellen plans to detail US efforts to \u201cresponsibly manage\u201d the relationship with China while simultaneously deepening ties to partners including Japan, South Korea, India and Vietnam and intensifying engagement through multilateral venues like APEC, the Treasury official told CNN. Meanwhile, global concern about the health of China\u2019s economy has deepened in recent months as the country\u2019s real estate bust threatens to infect the broader economy. Investors have been yanking money from China\u2019s stock market at an unprecedented pace amid unease over Beijing\u2019s response. In August, Biden told Democratic donors at a fundraising event that China\u2019s economy is a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d that could prompt leaders in Beijing to lash out. \u201cThat\u2019s not good because when bad folks have problems, they do bad things,\u201d Biden told donors. During this week\u2019s speech, Yellen also plans to detail the strategic priorities shaping America\u2019s economic engagements: Boosting trade and investment in the region while creating a level playing field for American workers and advancing US values and interests; friendshoring and other moves to strengthen supply chains and using economic engagements to address climate change and other global challenges, according to Treasury.

The annual event has been celebrated by the Black Sea countries every year since 1996, when agreements were signed aimed at protecting the sea from pollution. Posting on \u2018X\u2019, Zelenskiy said: \u201cThe Black Sea has strategic significance not just for its neighboring nations but for Europe, the Middle East, and global food security. \u201cRussia has turned it into a battleground, using it for aggression and threatening freedom of navigation. \u201cToday, we need to work together to restore the Black Sea as a zone of peace, trade, and development.\u201d Updated at 8.51am GMT 8.15am GMT The Russian tycoon Alexey Kuzmichev has been detained for questioning in France in connection with alleged tax evasion and money laundering and for violating international sanctions, the French Financial Prosecutors office has said. Searches took place on Monday at Kuzmichev\u2019s Paris home and in the Mediterranean Var region as part of the investigation, the office said, confirming a report in the French newspaper Le Monde. Kuzmichev was still being detailed on Tuesday but has not yet been charged in the case. French customs agents last year seized the oligarch\u2019s 27-metre yacht, La Petite Ourse, sparking a legal battle between authorities and Kuzmichev, one of the main shareholders of Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank.

The band directors from Columbiana, East Palestine, and Southern Local Schools will head to New York City in November for the festivities. The three are among 408 band directors from across the nation that will march in The Band Director's Marching Band. \"There's a lot of excitement,\" said Charles Miller, the Columbiana's Band Director. \"It's a great opportunity to represent our local community, beyond just the service we do for kids through music.\" Miller, alongside Southern Local's Emily Forbes Bowling and East Palestine's Jennifer Mollenkopf, started preparing for the parade this past spring. They've been working to learn and memorize the sheet music since then. After practicing for months on their own, the trio will meet with the other 405 directors the Sunday before Thanksgiving for their first group rehearsal. It's a whirlwind from then on, with more rehearsals on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It will all lead up to Thursday morning, when The Band Director's Marching Band will gather around 2:30 a.m. to set up for the parade. Viewers can expect to hear some marching classics like John Phillip Sousa's 'The Stars and Stripes Forever.' This will be Miller's first Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and most of all, he says he's excited to learn. \"As a director there's always growth opportunities,\" Miller added. \"Being able to network and communicate with directors all from over the country is gonna be a great opportunity for us to grow professionally, but as musicians, too.\" You can watch the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade on November 23rd starting at 9 a.m. on 21 News.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: New Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Balloon Revealed\ndate: 2023-10-23\nbody: A new balloon will be flying high above the streets of New York City when the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off next month.

The surprise announcement took place at halftime during a football game between UMass and New Mexico. This will be the Minuteman Marching Band\u2019s second time performing in the parade, the first being in 2013. Band director Tim Anderson has led the group since 2011. \u201cWe've been rebuilding, you know, coming out of the pandemic and stuff like that, and everyone's worked really hard,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThis is just a real neat thing for them to kind of say, you know, almost officially saying we're back to where we were before.\u201d The group was selected as one of ten bands that will be performing at the parade from a pool of over one hundred applicants from colleges and high schools across the country. The selection coincides with the 150th anniversary of the band\u2019s founding this year. According to Anderson, he was aware of the selection as early as last spring. The news was kept secret from the public \u2014 and the band members themselves \u2014 until Saturday\u2019s announcement. \u201cI'm somewhat amazed we were able to keep it under wraps for that long,\u201d he said. Marielle Chrupcala is a junior at UMass and a drum major. She recalled the moment when the announcement was made that the band would be performing at next year\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, describing it as \u201celectric.\u201d \u201cThe band sounded incredible after the announcement because everyone was just so excited to play,\u201d she said. The announcement also coincided with Band Day, a day where high school bands from across Massachusetts are invited to UMass to experience a halftime performance by the Minuteman Marching Band. Qeanu Smith, a junior and drum major, said that the announcement sparked interest from the visiting high schoolers. \u201cThere were a lot of high schoolers after that were coming up and were like, \u2018Oh, so like, how do I get into UMass?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey're like, 'Oh my goodness... I could go to UMass next year and be in the band,' which was really awesome... to get more people to go with us next year.\u201d Fundraising is still in the works to cover travel and lodging expenses for the trip to New York City, but a $10,000 check from Macy\u2019s will give the band a head start on covering costs. The check was presented to the band by Jim Maher, manager of the Macy\u2019s location in Holyoke.

Gauff mounted a fierce comeback to beat Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka in the U.S. Open final, claiming her first Grand Slam title and her place in American tennis royalty. The triumph came amid a 16-match winning streak for Gauff that ended in the China Open semi-final last month at the hands of old foe Iga Swiatek of Poland. \"The next generation has arrived and stood on the shoulders of the great Serena Williams and Venus Williams,\" said Allaster, the chief executive, Professional Tennis, with the USTA. \"It feels like she's been around for a long time. She's only 19... She is special. She is humble and kind, she's hardworking. And she is very, very focused on winning.\" The 19-year-old proved as captivating to fans as the idols who inspired her growing up as 3.4 million viewers tuned in for the U.S. Open final on ESPN, making it the most-watched major women's championship ever on the network. The moment was made all the sweeter for Allaster, the former WTA head who won the Women's Sports Foundation's Billie Jean King Leadership Award this year after the U.S. Open celebrated its 50th anniversary of gender equal prize money. It is a landmark that has yet to be replicated across all of tennis as the WTA announced earlier this year a \"pathway to handing out equal prize money\" at combined WTA 1000 and 500 events, starting from 2027. \"It's certainly a proof point of the value of women's sport, of women's tennis, when the fans are showing up in the stadiums and loving it,\" she said. \"And then we know the fans are showing up and consuming on ESPN and around the world.\" World number three Gauff will next compete in\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Girls individual tennis state championships scheduled for this weekend\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: The N.C.

The promising performances and beautiful weather enticed many to Zilker Park for a weekend of live music. After all, who doesn\u2019t love a few days with your friends, drinks in hand, surrounded by good music, good food and the sound of plastic bottles and cans crunching under your feet as you walk from stage to stage? Music festivals generate about 23,500 metric tons of solid waste each year. Of all the recyclable waste created from cans, plastic bottles and food containers, only around 8% is actually recycled properly. Not to mention, the flights or road trips taken by festival-goers and performers contribute to rising carbon emissions.

Advertised as three days of peace and music, the event attracted some 400,000 attendees (twice the expected 200,000 maximum) who were entertained by 32 acts. While Woodstock certainly wasn't the first music festival to be held in the U.S., it changed the course of the industry from community-run and just-for-fun to commercial and competitive. About 32 million Americans attend music festivals each year, according to Billboard. Almost half of these are millennials, who place a lot of value on experiences and travel.

Originating as a harvest festival, Thanksgiving is one of the biggest holidays in the US. People across the country gather together to share a meal and reflect on all the things they\u2019re grateful for. But there\u2019s much more to do during this beautiful time of giving thanks than just eating. From parades to shopping, running to volunteering \u2013 Thanksgiving is celebrated in a wide variety of ways. We\u2019ve put together our bucket list for the ultimate US Thanksgiving celebration.\nWatch the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade\nThe Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade is now of the most famous holiday traditions in the United States. In New York City, thousands of people line the streets of Manhattan to watch. This particular parade is known for its giant inflatable balloons that float between the skyscrapers, high above the onlookers.\nBreak the wishbone for good luck\nIt may sound silly, but this is a real thing! After carving the turkey, the wishbone, a Y-shaped bone that carries much superstition, gets set aside to dry. Once the meal is over, two people make their wishes and break the wishbone. Whoever ends up with the bigger piece is said to have their wish come true and good luck for the upcoming year.\nEat a traditional Thanksgiving meal\nNo Thanksgiving Day would be complete without the traditional meal. Must-eats are: roast turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, and sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Green bean casserole has become a popular dish, especially in the Midwest. Completing the meal is, of course, pumpkin pie for dessert. After all of that it\u2019s time for the next tradition. . .\n\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\nThanksgiving Traditions - National Geographic Kids\nThanksgiving Traditions\nSkip to content\nSearch\nShop\nSubscribe\nmenu\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

While communing with loved ones and showing appreciation for the bounties and gifts provided is one positive aspect of the national holiday, teaching a false narrative of its beginnings perpetuates colonialism and ignores more than 400 years of atrocities committed against Native Americans and First Nations\u2019 people.\n\u201cIt just disregards (the centuries of brutality) against Native Americans and chooses to take this one tiny snapshot, and in the world of social media, it puts all the pretty filters on it so that it doesn\u2019t look the way it truly did,\u201d said Dr. Kelli Mosteller, Citizen Potawatomi Nation\u2019s Cultural Heritage Center director.\nAccording to an article published in\nThe New York Times\nby Maya Salam in 2017, \u201cThanksgiving facts and Thanksgiving myths have blended together for years like so much gravy and mashed potatoes, and separating them is just as complicated.\u201d\nThe formation of Thanksgiving as an official, United States\u2019 holiday, did not begin until November 1863 during the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln officially established the holiday as a way to improve relations between northern and southern states as well as the U.S. and tribal nations. Just a year prior, a mass execution took place of Dakota tribal members. Corrupt federal agents kept the Dakota-Sioux from receiving food and provisions. Finally at the brink of death from starvation, members of the tribe fought back, resulting in the Dakota War of 1862. In the end, President Lincoln ordered 38 Dakota men to die from hanging, and he felt that Thanksgiving offered an opportunity to bridge the hard feelings amongst Natives and the federal government.\n\u201cIt was propaganda,\u201d Dr. Mosteller explained. \u201cIt was to try and build this event so that you could have a deeper narrative about community building and coming together in shared brother\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

In this article, we\u2019ll be discussing the top ten most popular foods in the USA as of 2023. There is unfortunately no singular source to objectively measure this kind of data. However, websites like YouGov, which is the site that we\u2019ll be using , crowdsource and use polls to determine their results. The reference that we\u2019re using is the most popular American dishes as of Q3 of 2023, the most up-to-date at the time this article is being written.

We're one step past that.) For many of us, the opportunity to spend some time outdoors eating and drinking makes the next several weeks the highlight of the year. Fall also marks the time when some of the best food festivals in Dallas pop up on the calendar.

Whether the mood calls for sampling German beer, dining on an Italian feast, soaking in Scottish heritage, mamboing to mariachi music, or tangling with sumo wrestlers, you\u2019ll find it at events throughout the South. Fall is a particularly popular time for fairs and festivals, but such celebrations take place year-round, adding flavor to meetings and satisfying attendees\u2019 craving for authentic experiences. Here are some highlights of festivals that invite visitors to explore the variety of ethnic roots in Southern communities. Greece in Arkansas Opa! Avid festival goers describe the gyros at the International Greek Food Festival in Little Rock, Ark., as the best outside of Greece. Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church hosts the festival that\u2019s been a tradition in the state capital for more than 35 years and is said to be the largest ethnic festival in Arkansas.

Similar heritage festivals can be found throughout the year in the US, but what they have become has resulted in misconstrued ideas. Oktoberfest starts in September, despite the misleading name, and draws crowds annually to Munich, Germany. It is the world\u2019s largest folk festival while also boasting the static of having 6 million liters of ale being consumed over the duration of the festival. It\u2019s no surprise that it has been adopted by Americans. Oktoberfest traces its past to celebrations for Baravian royals while showing off the culture of the nation. The week of games was centered around a horse race and less about the drinks served. Another misunderstood festival is Cinco de Mayo. Cinco de Mayo is a celebration throughout the US where people consume their favorite Mexican food and bottomless margaritas. What is the real Mexican significance? Contrary to common thought, the holiday isn\u2019t Mexico\u2019s independence day, which is actually Sept. 16. Cinco de Mayo is merely a celebration of Mexico defeating the French in a town called Puebla. In fact, the battle is only celebrated in some cities in Mexico. The holiday initially caught on in the US in the 1950s as a way to bridge the gap with Mexican culture. Spanish teacher Stephanie Risius feels the holiday has moved past its roots. \u201c\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Fall festivals celebrate San Antonio\u2019s cultural diversity\ndate: 2023-09-28\nbody: While it might still feel like summer in San Antonio, the fall festival season is here to remind us that there are plenty of reasons to venture back outdoors to immerse ourselves in the city\u2019s many cultural offerings.

But the circumstances of how the two men were killed remained a mystery. The San Bernardino Police Department responded to the scene and provided details regarding the incident. Around 11 p.m., San Bernardino police officers were dispatched to a reported armed robbery, which had taken place in a back parking lot at the National Orange Show, a large-scale music festival. The suspect was described as a male wearing an orange vest and a beanie hat, armed with a handgun. Upon their arrival at the scene, officers quickly identified the suspect as 53-year-old David Rojas Sr., a resident of San Bernardino, who matched the description and was armed with a firearm. A confrontation unfolded, during which Rojas fired upon the officers, prompting them to return fire in self-defense, police said. Despite his extensive history of violent criminal activities, Rojas was taken into custody by the officers and transported to a local hospital, police said. Tragically, he succumbed to the injuries he sustained during the confrontation. As authorities continued to canvass the area for potential witnesses and additional evidence, they made a grim discovery. Nearby, they found a man who had suffered a gunshot wound and tragically succumbed to his injuries. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. It appears that David Rojas Sr. had no known connection to the National Orange Show event where the incident occurred. The investigation into the events leading up to this tragic incident is ongoing. San Bernardino police are seeking the assistance of the public in gathering additional information about the incident. Those with knowledge of the situation or who may have witnessed the events unfold are urged to contact the San Bernardino Investigations Unit at 909-384-5615.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Video Report: Bond set at $50,000 for man accused of burning building on Dauphin Street\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: Discover the story of an individual facing a $50,000 bond for allegedly setting a commercial building on Dauphin Street ablaze.

In the late 2000s, the NBA schedule release date was in the first week of August, before moving to Aug. 10 in 2010.

You have many variables to consider, including travel stipends, prizes, audiences, networking opportunities and industry attendance. But there\u2019s an X factor you shouldn\u2019t forget: Sometimes a film festival can also be a vacation. Local communities certainly view film festivals as tourism, and maybe you should, too. MovieMaker tapped filmmaker surveys, traveler reviews, and in-person visits to evaluate what film festivals are especially worth the travel. Yes, you\u2019ll remember the networking, the great Q&A about your film, the awards. These things are very important. But there\u2019s also something to be said for eating a real California burrito in San Diego. Here\u2019s our list of 20 Great Film Festivals in Vacation Destinations.

The growing festival, which received more than 600 submissions this year, has a lot to boast about in the fifth annual edition that runs from Monday through Sunday, Nov. 5. Multiple attending directors will travel from around the world to descend on Happy Valley and speak with the audience, two world premieres will take place, a brief concert is planned following a documentary about a punk-rock group returning to Ukraine \u2014 and, of course, lots and lots of movies are on tap. Some films debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year (\u201c Fancy Dance \u201d), while others count nominations and awards from the Tribeca Festival (\u201c Marinette \u201d) and SXSW Festival. Some films were shot in Ukraine and Spain; others are from rural Pennsylvania (\u201c Hayride to Hell \u201d).

There is a lot of history and fun facts that go into making the parade possible! The Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade occurs in Uptown Manhattan, New York City. The first parade was in 1924. This annual tradition has only missed three years in 1942, 1943, and 1944. There was no parade during these years due to World War II. According to History.com, the first parade had around 250,000 people in attendance. Ever since then, the attendance has been growing! They started doing the parade to increase holiday sales and to highlight the new Macy\u2019s store. In the first parade, the employees marched through 34th Street. The employees dressed up as knights, clowns, and cowboys. As the years went on the attendance for the parade kept on growing! Every year three million people plan to attend the parade. According to USA Today the big balloons are a cherished tradition in the parade. The first balloon was Felix the Cat and he made his first appearance in 1927. Most of the balloons they have in the parade today are around 60 feet long, and 30 feet wide. It can take up to 90 people to hold the balloons, and they are all Macy\u2019s employees. If you want to attend the parade it is free! According to Time Out, the parade lasts from 9:00 a.m. to noon every year! If you are planning to go to the parade, plan to get there three hours early to get a good spot.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Three Valley band directors to join Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\ndate: 2023-10-24\nbody: You may recognize some familiar faces in the 2023 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The band directors from Columbiana, East Palestine, and Southern Local Schools will head to New York City in November for the festivities. The three are among 408 band directors from across the nation that will march in The Band Director's Marching Band. \"There's a lot of excitement,\" said Charles Miller, the Columbiana's Band Director. \"It's a great opportunity to represent our local community, beyond just the service we do for kids through music.\" Miller, alongside Southern Local's Emily Forbes Bowling and East Palestine's Jennifer Mollenkopf, started preparing for the parade this past spring. They've been working to learn and memorize the sheet music since then. After practicing for months on their own, the trio will meet with the other 405 directors the Sunday before Thanksgiving for their first group rehearsal. It's a whirlwind from then on, with more rehearsals on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It will all lead up to Thursday morning, when The Band Director's Marching Band will gather around 2:30 a.m. to set up for the parade. Viewers can expect to hear some marching classics like John Phillip Sousa's 'The Stars and Stripes Forever.' This will be Miller's first Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and most of all, he says he's excited to learn. \"As a director there's always growth opportunities,\" Miller added. \"Being able to network and communicate with directors all from over the country is gonna be a great opportunity for us to grow professionally, but as musicians, too.\" You can watch the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade on November 23rd starting at 9 a.m. on 21 News.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade: Date, time, channel, full lineup & what to know\ndate: 2023-10-23\nbody: Forget turkey.

As viewers line up along the iconic NYC route to catch a glimpse of some of the more than two dozen balloons, joining this year's lineup , there will be a new character balloon from Netflix's upcoming animated film LEO , starring Adam Sandler. The upcoming coming-of-age animated musical comedy centered around jaded 74-year-old lizard Leo (Sandler), who has \"been stuck in the same Florida classroom for decades with his terrarium-mate turtle (Bill Burr). When he learns he only has one year left to live, he plans to escape to experience life on the outside but instead gets caught up in the problems of his anxious students - including an impossibly mean substitute teacher. It ends up being the strangest but most rewarding bucket list ever.\" Bringing Leo to life in balloon form involved about 50 gallons of paint. Leo is one of several new balloons debuting during the 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Other newcomers include Beagle Scout Snoopy, Blue Cat & Chugs, Monkey D. Luffy.

{"question_id": 1136, "turns": ["[INST] You are a smart AI assistant. Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 03:01AM\nGiven a question from a Los Angeles, California user: Major political events in the US this year\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: The Catchup: 5 major political stories this week, from the new House speaker to Trump's latest legal woes\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: Jon Ward is a Yahoo News senior correspondent who has covered national politics for over 15 years. You\u2019re shifting gears to head into the weekend, so here are the top five political stories worth remembering this week \u2014 and what it all means for you. sThe week of Oct. 23 saw the Republican Party finally throw up its hands and pick someone to be speaker of the House. And the Middle East continued to roil with violence, as tensions over a broader regional conflict ratcheted up. The U.S. also saw yet another mass killing \u2014 this time in Lewiston, Maine \u2014 that left 18 dead and more than a dozen wounded. The incident quickly led to calls for stronger gun laws. Here are the highlights from this past week, from the war in Israel to a partial resolution of the United Auto Workers strike. House Republicans finally pick a new boss Many of the Republicans crowding around Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana on Wednesday, for all their effusiveness, were likely feeling something like pity for the new speaker of the House. Johnson, 51, is stepping into a role of enormous responsibility and scope, and with little experience under his belt. \u201cHe faces a terrifyingly steep learning curve and almost no margin for error,\u201d wrote Brendan Buck, an adviser to former Speaker Paul Ryan when the Wisconsin Republican took over the speakership in 2015 following a previous revolt by hard-line House Republicans. Why it matters Johnson, a dyed-in-the-wool social conservative, was in the right place at the right time. He was chosen in part because Republicans reached a point of exhaustion after three weeks of infighting that was part comedy, part tragedy. And what seemed to push him over the line was the fact that, as one fellow Republican put it, \"he has the fewest enemies.\" Johnson has promoted Louisiana's current abortion ban, which has penalties of 1 to 10 years in jail for medical providers. And he has advocated for banning same-sex marriage. These views put Johnson well to the right of many of his Republican colleagues. That\u2019s one thing for a congressman representing a few hundred thousand conservative voters in a Southern state. But Johnson is now a national face of the GOP. Former President Trump was a factor in the speaker\u2019s race. He was not able to push Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio into the top spot, but he did help derail the bid of another Republican, Rep. Tom\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Q&A discussion about the Israel-Hamas war with De Anza political science professor\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: On Oct. 7, the paramilitary wing Hamas attacked Israel by air, land, and sea. Thousands of armed Hamas fighters breached Israel\u2019s Gaza border wall and began to fire toward Israeli civilians and kidnapped hostages. Condemning the attack, Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, formally declared war against Hamas. Soon after, the Israeli Defense Force intensified their bombing campaign against the Gaza Strip. As political justifications and civilian death tolls began rapidly escalating, misleading information about the war divided Israeli and Palestinian supporters further. La Voz spoke to James Nguyen, a De Anza political science professor, to discuss involved parties, cause, and impacts of future events of the Israel-Hamas war. Quotes have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. La Voz: Could you give us a brief history of the conflict? James Nguyen: This has been an ongoing, challenging situation in that region. The people of Gaza are Palestinian, but it was once occupied by Israel. There\u2019s a Palestinian militant terrorist group in Gaza called Hamas. There have been challenges, mostly around terrorist attacks that have happened, and also military attacks that have happened between militant Palestinians and Israel for years, decades. There was a kind of quiet, uneasy peace that\u2019s kind of always been over the region, except when there\u2019s been war. And then Hamas attacked Israel. A surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing several hundred Israelis. Now Israel is responding by basically declaring all-out war on Hamas. But that\u2019s going to mean that they\u2019re going to go into Gaza, bomb Gaza, and try to take Hamas out, but that may lead to civilian casualties of Palestinian civilians. It\u2019s already been happening. I think the death toll is already somewhere around 5,800, the estimate, with close to half of that number being children. Israel is readying for a ground offensive. They\u2019re going to move ground troops into Gaza. They\u2019ve sort of laid the groundwork by bombing a lot of buildings. It\u2019s a highly densely populated and also very urban environment in Gaza. So I think that they\u2019re preparing for the ground attack by bombing a lot of buildings to ease that process. But it\u2019s going to likely be as experts have said already, a protracted urban guerilla-type warfare.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Wars, Political Chaos, Confusion and Anger: What to Do? By Tom Timberman\ndate: 2023-10-28\nbody: In late October 2023, it is difficult to resist the temptation to drink more, to skip headlines or on-line \u201cbreaking news\u201d or to avoid those friends who insist on talking politics and/or foreign policy. Beyond their cults and tribes, most Americans today don\u2019t agree on much of anything. We are told the country is running out of money because the national debt and interest payments are much too high. But, then also, that the economy is recovering surprisingly well from the pandemic and our GDP could rise to $26 Trillion. The US, the President recently said, is the only country powerful enough to stabilize and defend global democracies, fighting for their very existence. Or, others in America maintain, we should avoid intervening in foreign conflicts because: (a) can\u2019t afford it, (b) solve domestic problems first and (c) we make the situations worse. Compromise in the Congress, even within its party conferences, is now considered by many a relic of a sunnier, distant past. Today, a number of politicians believe, it reflects only weakness. Thus, for the first time in US history, the House majority has been unable to elect a speaker from among its members. The result: all Federal legislation has been stopped for almost 2 weeks. If this cannot be resolved quickly, the 12 funding bills required to support the US Government through FY 24, will not be passed, forcing it to shut down in November. And President Biden\u2019s very recent Congressional proposal to provide $106 Billion in aid for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and SW Border security, will be introduced, but possibly not considered or voted upon. The traditional internal American unity behind national foreign policies appears to have ended or at least to have taken a long break. Adding to this problem, is the substitution by some elected officials of rigid policy positions and ego satisfaction for their sworn duty to execute their Constitutional responsibilities for the Commonweal. Taken together, they pose a serious threat to the continued viability of the United States. What to do? The US Electorate should take a communal deep breath and focus on this situation, understand its current and future implications and demand the two historically dominant political parties and their representatives at the local, state and national levels get back to work on their behalf, not their own.

The resulting attention and energy may well have propelled the Democrats to a narrow win at the ballot box the following year. Republicans should do the same, to replicate their success in 2024. And evidence from a Florida debate shows why Cobb County should pursue this. It was an amazing night in November of 2019. All of the major Democratic Party candidates showed up to the primary debate. They were joined by some well-known political figures like Stacey Abrams, celebrities like Rosario Dawson, and media personalities like Chris Matthews. In addition to the studios, there were watch parties, and political visits by the major candidates in the area colleges and other locations. For a professor and columnist like me, it was a front-row seat to see firsthand the enthusiasm and momentum this had for the Democratic Party, energy that helped boost the party to narrowly take the state. The Republicans could use some of that. They bragged about how their first primary debate helped their Wisconsin efforts by holding it in Milwaukee. And the Reagan Presidential Library wasn\u2019t a bad choice, though none of the participants outside of Nikki Haley seemed particularly Reaganesque. I understand what the party is trying to do in Miami Beach in November, though that would have been a better choice earlier this year. But the party should not ignore Georgia as a debate location. Plus, Cobb County needs to push hard to snare one of these prime-time primary contests. They can also bring in some great revenue and publicity for the region. In the Fall of 2012, Lynn University hosted the final presidential debate between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. According to a study by Lynn University \u201cthe final presidential debate hosted by the school on Oct 22, produced $13.1 million in immediate economic impact for the Palm Beach County economy, including approximately $1.7 million in elevated spending by local residents, increased bed taxes by 22 percent and obtained more than $63 million in publicity value for Lynn and the community, including more than $50 million for the City of Boca Raton.\u201d The report went on to document the sources of benefits, ranging from facility and operational spending, delegate and media spending (nearly $3 million by their count), and \u201cAncillary events such as Spin the Vote in Delray Beach\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Trump, DeSantis rival events accent US Republican divide\ndate: 2023-03-03\nbody: Washington, DC \u2013 A schism in the United States conservative movement is on display among Republicans, with the presumed presidential frontrunners attending separate major events and constituencies divided on issues such as aid to Ukraine, defence spending, the debt ceiling and the role of the US government. Former President Donald Trump, who has already declared his intention to run for a second term in 2024, will headline the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) that kicked off this week just outside Washington, DC. Once the dominant event in conservative politics, it has lost some of its lustre as it embraced Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again (MAGA) constituency. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, considered Trump\u2019s strongest competitor, is skipping CPAC in favour of an exclusive donor retreat sponsored by the anti-tax Club For Growth conservative organisation. Trump, once supported by the group, has not been invited to the closed-door gathering being held in Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago estate. The duelling events have divided prominent Republicans who served under Trump, with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo choosing CPAC, former Vice President Mike Pence heading to the retreat and Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, speaking at both. Haley announced her 2024 presidential run last month. \u201cThere are always divides in parties and those become heightened by presidential primaries,\u201d Republican consultant Doug Heye told Al Jazeera. It is not clear at the moment how big that Republican divide is, he said. DeSantis has not yet declared his candidacy but is already behaving like a man on the stump, as he tours across the country promoting his new book The Courage to be Free, which lays out his policy agenda. The governor has brandished his conservative agenda and won praise from many on the right by signing a series of laws, including on cultural issues, as well putting a limit on corporate America, some of his favourite targets. On Monday, DeSantis signed a bill to end the self-governing status of Disney World, after the corporation last year criticised his Parental Rights in Education law, which limited teaching on gender identity and sexual orientation. DeSantis\u2019s tough stance towards big business stands in sharp contrast to the previous embrace of many Republicans. \u201cIn this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand,\u201d DeSantis wrote in his book\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 03:02AM\nGiven a question from a Los Angeles, California user: Next SpaceX rocket launch date\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Live coverage: Falcon 9 rocket counting down to SpaceX\u2019s record-breaking 62nd launch of the year\ndate: 2023-09-03\nbody: A Falcon 9 rocket is being readied Sunday for a record-breaking 62nd orbital launch of the year for SpaceX. The previous record was set in 2022 with 61 launches by the company. Liftoff from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, with 21 Starlink satellites aboard, is currently targeted for 9:56 p.m. EDT (0156 UTC). SpaceX has averaged an orbital rocket launch every four days so far this year. It chalked up nine Falcon 9 launches in August. A total of 62 launches in a calendar year would be the highest number achieved by a single commercial launch company. \u201cAiming for 10 Falcon flights in a month by end of this year, then 12 per month next year,\u201d SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said in a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. This 62nd launch of the year for SpaceX will carry 21 of the so-called V2 mini satellites for the company\u2019s Starlink internet service. Seconds after clearing the launch pad, the Falcon 9 will pitch and roll on to a south-east trajectory, targeting an orbit inclined at 43 degrees to the equator. After separating from the second stage about two and a half minutes into flight, the first stage booster will head for a landing on the drone ship \u2018Just Read the Instructions\u2019, which will be stationed in the Atlantic east of the Bahamas about 390 miles (627 km) from the Cape. The first stage booster, tailnumber B1077, is making its 10th mission. Two burns of the second stage are required to place the satellites into the required circular orbit. Separation of the 21 Starlinks will occur about one hour, five minutes after launch. It will be the 16th launch of this next-generation Starlink satellite model which is larger and has four times the bandwidth of the previous versions. The full-sized V2 Starlink satellites are due to be launched by SpaceX\u2019s fully-reusable Starship vehicle, but the delayed debut of Starship led the company to create a condensed version of the satellites so they could be launched on Falcon 9. According to statistics compiled by Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who maintains a space flight database, to date SpaceX has launched a total of 5,027 Starlink satellites into orbit. In early May, SpaceX announced it had more than 1.5 million subscribers to Starlink\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: SpaceX Moving Toward Weekend Rocket Launch at Vandenberg SFB\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: A Falcon 9 rocket launch planned for this weekend at Vandenberg Space Force Base would mark the third of the month from the West Coast. Following Oct. 9 and Oct. 21 blastoffs, another SpaceX rocket will lift off from Space Launch Complex-4 on South Base possibly as soon as Saturday night. Late Friday afternoon, advisories released before the launch said the mission would occur between 11:16 p.m. Saturday and 3:35 a.m. Sunday. Notices issued ahead of the launch initially said the mission would occur between 11:37 p.m. Friday and 3:57 a.m. Saturday but were revised. SpaceX had not released targeted launch time as noon Friday. Rocket launches can be delayed for a number of reason including technical troubles, unfavorable weather or the team falling behind in pre-liftoff chores. While the rocket\u2019s liftoff will make its typical rumble, residents won\u2019t hear the sonic booms that accompany the Falcon\u2019s first-stage booster since it won\u2019t return to Vandenberg. Instead, the first-stage booster will touch down on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship stationed in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX also plans to capture the two halves of the rocket\u2019s nose cone for future reuse. The West Coast liftoff is one of two planned within 24 hours, with the second taking place from Florida. Both missions will carry Starlink satellites adding to thousands of others already in orbit in the effort to continue expanding a space-based constellation to provide internet services across the globe in areas where land-based access is not reliable or readily available Live webcasts of each mission are scheduled to begin on the SpaceX account of the site formerly known as Twitter about five minutes before liftoff.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: SpaceX Fuels Starship as ULA's Vulcan Readies for Christmas Launch\u2014Plus More Rocket News\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: It\u2019s been an unusually busy week in spaceflight, with the chatter restricted to rockets still on the ground. In a particularly festive update, United Launch Alliance (ULA) is gearing up for the launch of its Vulcan Centaur rocket on Christmas Eve. In what should serve as a thrilling finale to the year, United Launch Alliance is gearing up for the much-anticipated launch of its Vulcan Centaur rocket, ready to light up the December skies from Cape Canaveral. While space enthusiasts eagerly await this cosmic spectacle, the week has been bustling with activity, featuring critical tests of SpaceX\u2019s Starship, Ariane 6, and significant progress with NASA\u2019s Artemis 2 mission. A Vulcan Christmas gift United Launch Alliance (ULA) announced plans to launch its highly anticipated Vulcan Centaur rocket on December 24 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with the launch window extending until December 26, CNBC reported. Company CEO Tory Bruno confirmed the launch date during his appearance at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit on Tuesday. It\u2019s a very Grinchy launch window, but space waits for no one. The announcement brings to mind the launch of the Webb Space Telescope on Christmas Day 2021. Vulcan\u2019s inaugural mission will carry two payloads: a commercial lunar lander developed by Astrobotic and precious cargo for Celestis\u2014ashes of deceased individuals wanting to make space their final frontier. ULA is currently working to build and qualify the upper stage of the rocket. These two tasks, the prepping of the fully expendable 202-foot-tall (62-meter) rocket for launch and the qualification tests, are running \u201cin parallel,\u201d Bruno explained, with completion anticipated in November, according to CNBC. ULA\u2019s Vulcan has faced challenges and delays over the past year, including a dramatic engine explosion during tests in March. In a related note, ULA was originally slated to launch two demonstration satellites for Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper during its maiden voyage. However, delays with the rocket led to a change of plans, resulting in the satellites\u2019 successful launch in early October aboard ULA\u2019s trusty Atlas V rocket. In development since 2014, Vulcan is set to replace the company\u2019s Atlas V and Delta IV rockets, both of which have been in use for the past two decades. The Vulcan Centaur rocket is ULA\u2019s next step in space transportation, aiming to provide more efficient and cost-effective launch\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rocket on 47th Starlink launch of 2023\ndate: 2023-10-17\nbody: Update 9:05 p.m. EDT (2222 UTC): Launch at 8:39 p.m. EDT (0039 UTC). SpaceX followed up a double launch day on Friday, Oct. 13, with an evening launch of a Falcon 9 rocket, sending up another 22 Starlink V2 Mini satellites to low Earth orbit. The Tuesday evening mission from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launched at 8:39 p.m. EDT (0039 UTC on Oct. 18). The Starlink Group 6-23 mission came just 4 days, 1 hour and 38 minutes following the last mission to launch from SLC-40, the Starlink Group 6-22 mission, which launched Friday evening at 7:01 p.m. EDT (2301 UTC). With a successful launch on Tuesday evening, SpaceX completed its 74th launch of 2023. Put another way, that means it has launched on average once roughly every 3.92 days. The company also stated in a post at the weekend on the social media site X that following Friday\u2019s Starlink launch, SpaceX has sent more than 900 metric tons to orbit this year. The booster launching this mission, B1062, made its 16th flight, including launching the Inspiration4 civilian astronaut mission, the Ax-1 private astronaut mission and two GPS satellites. About 8.5 minutes after launch, it landed on the droneship, \u201cJust Read the Instructions.\u201d That last launch brought SpaceX one step closer to having 5,000 satellites on orbit. According to data compiled by Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and expert on spaceflight activity, of the 5,265 Starlink satellites launched to LEO as of Oct. 13, 4,905 of them are still in orbit and 4,874 are currently working. There are currently 467 Starlink satellites that have been launched to the current Group 6 shell of the constellation of which 448 are listed as \u201cworking.\u201d This all comes as SpaceX is pushing towards its second integrated flight test of its Starship rocket from its Starbase launch and testing site in South Texas. The company restacked the upper stage, dubbed Ship 25, onto Booster 9 ahead of a planned wet dress rehearsal at a yet to be announced date. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not yet issued a launch license for the IFT\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rocket carrying 22 Starlink satellites on its second Friday launch\ndate: 2023-10-13\nbody: A Falcon 9 rocket carrying 22 Starlink satellites, delayed by upper level winds and held up for the Falcon Heavy launch of NASA\u2019s Psyche, launched from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 7:01 p.m. EDT (2301 UTC) Friday night. The U.S. Space Force\u2019s 45th Weather Squadron, based at Cape Canaveral, on Thursday predicted a 60 percent chance of acceptable weather for the first of today\u2019s launch opportunities which improved to 80 percent chance at the end of the window. A launch attempt on Oct. 8 was aborted with just 23 seconds left on the clock. SpaceX said the delay was due to upper level winds. While a West Coast Starlink launch went ahead a few hours later, SpaceX put the Cape launch on hold at the request of NASA, which wanted to prioritize the Falcon Heavy launch of the Psyche asteroid mission, which launched earlier Friday. SpaceX didn\u2019t need any of its five back up launch opportunities Friday, which ranged from at 7:51 p.m. EDT (2351 UTC) to 10:29 p.m. EDT (0429 UTC). The Falcon 9 carried 22 second-generation satellites for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink internet service. The company announced recently that its now had more than two million subscribers for its broadband internet in more than 60 countries. After lifting off, the Falcon 9 headed southeast, targeting an orbit inclined at 43 degrees to the equator. The first stage booster, B1067, made its 14 flight, separating from the second stage about two and a half minutes into flight and then arcing downrange for a landing on the drone ship A Shortfall of Gravitas. The barge was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the Bahamas about 420 miles (675 km) from Cape Canaveral. Two burns of the Falcon 9\u2019s second stage will be required to place the satellites into the required 182 x 176 mile (293 x 284 km) orbit. Separation of the satellite stack is scheduled to occur just over an hour into the flight.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

CBS will identify a specific number of teams that it wants to carry for a specific minimum of games, only picking AFC teams since the network has the AFC package (Fox will do the same with the NFC). Under the former contract, CBS aired games between two AFC teams and inter-conference games where the AFC team is on the road. The league could \"cross-flex\" games between CBS and Fox to expand the presence of noteworthy games.\nGames can also be flexed to \"Monday Night Football\" in the final four weeks of the season, which will increase the amount of \"cross flexing games on Sundays between CBS and Fox.

Qualifying times are established for different age and gender categories. Still, with so many applicants, the unofficial cutoff times for acceptance were five minutes and 29 seconds faster than the official qualifying time many athletes push for.

Jessica Forgie joined myFM in the Morning to celebrate making it to the 128th Boston Marathon after posting a 3-hour, 26-minute qualifying run in Montreal last month, making the cut by four minutes. She says that a pair of friends have also qualified, which means she will have some company on the race route when they take off on April 15th. It\u2019s been a busy few months for Forgie, as she not only recently held a fundraiser run to support the ALS Society of Canada in Burnstown, but she\u2019s also been on maternity leave for her second child at the same time. But what will her focus be on when she crosses the starting line in Boston? If Forgie can finish the Boston Marathon in under 3-hours-30 minutes, she will qualify to return in 2025.

Last February, the city pulled together resources with the help of other cities and parishes to make sure there were enough officers on parade routes and in the French Quarter to keep revelers safe. \"Assuming all systems will go as they did last year which, was remarkably smoothly handled, when you realize how late it all came together,\" said Mardi Gras Guide publisher Arthur Hardy. The arrangements that allowed krewes roll on their traditional, pre-COVID pandemic routes came together so late that Hardy's publication featured the shortened routes in its pages. Mardi Gras Guide publisher Arthur Hardy says there's no expectation that it can't be done again. \"It was a win-win for everybody and I think we're expecting the same thing for 2024,\" he said.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: 3 new Mardi Gras parades will roll in Jefferson Parish in 2024.

On two weekends from November 3rd, 2023, the historic port will come alive with music from many countries and cultures performed by international and regional artists. Some events require admission; others are free. They are held at four sites in Eastport, the Maritime heart and soul of Annapolis. With sweeping views of the Chesapeake Bay, Eastport has a fun, laid-back atmosphere. Charming homes are nestled alongside boatyards and sailing schools. The neighborhood has many inviting restaurants, and on weekends, both tourists and \u201ctownies\u201d can be seen walking across the Spa Creek Bridge, passing the U.S. Naval Academy en route to and from downtown Annapolis. Deep Roots Maryland\u2019s capital city was without a jazz festival for decades\u2014until now! Once a jazz and rhythm & blues stronghold, the area boasted concerts at Carr\u2019s and Sparrow\u2019s beaches; the King of France Tavern was a nationally prominent venue; and St. John\u2019s College was home to the Annapolis Jazz Festival (iconic guitarist Charlie Byrd served as artistic director until 1996). In 2020, business and cultural leaders decided to reinstitute a festival dedicated to jazz. Having produced numerous festivals and concerts throughout Maryland, arts promoter Paulina Phillips was named executive director. An advisory board was formed and the new festival took shape with a widened scope, matching cultural diversity with artistic excellence to serve a broader audience. A veritable army of volunteers stepped forward to launch the festival last year. Weekend one: November 3-5, 2023 The 2023 festival kicks off on November 3 with Halley\u2019s Hot Gumbo Swingtet at a hip location: the historic Peerless Rens Club in Eastport\u2014a great spot for listening and dancing! A dynamic presence in and around the nation\u2019s capital, Halley Shoenberg is in demand performing and recording with numerous ensembles on clarinet, saxophone and flute. She\u2019s led concerts at Blues Alley and Strathmore, appeared at Carlyle Club and The Kennedy Center and entertained huge crowds of swing dancers at Glen Echo, Mobtown Ballroom and Potomac River Jazz Club events. Her numerous U.S. festival appearances include dates in the French Quarter of New Orleans, and she\u2019s ready to bring that awesome vibe to Annapolis for opening night. Shows are at 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Admission is $25. Two entertaining and educational free events will be held at Eastport-Annapolis Neck Library. The first is on Saturday, November 4 at 11:00 a.m. Nyame Nti will perform traditional West African drumming. (Such rhythms are considered foundational elements in American jazz.) Listeners will hear traditional rhythms such as Kou Kou, Jondon Wolosodon, Balanta, and Kakilamb\u00e9 and begin to understand their cultural and historical significance. Grammy-nominated lutenist Ronn McFarlane returns to Annapolis on Sunday, November 5 at 4:00 p.m. performing music of the British Isles with Ayreheart and guest vocalist Heather Aubrey Lloyd. McFarlane founded Ayreheart to bring the lute (the most popular instrument of the Renaissance), into the twenty-first century. The musicians combine traditional roots music with modern compositions in a festive program. Fans will find the Eastport United Methodist Church to be a beautiful and welcoming venue. Weekend Two: November 11-13, 2023 Prepare to be dazzled by a trio of virtuosos on Friday November 10 at 7:00 p.m. when international stars of Melodic Intersect perform at St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Church. Tabla player Enayet Hossain, keyboardist Greg Hatza and sitar player Hidayat Husain Khan will fuse classical Indian music with American jazz, as they have on their high charting albums. Sitarist Khan crosses many genres, collaborating with such artists as the Rolling Stones, Alicia Keys, Usher, Zakir\n----------------\nArticle No.: 6\nHighlighted Answer from Google: M e m b e r s o f t h e R o y a l C o u r t w i l l r i d e J a n . 1 , 2 0 2 4 , t h r o u g h t h e 1 3 5 t h R o s e P a r a d e o n t h e R o y a l C o u r t f l o a t a n d a t t e n d t h e C o l l e g e F o o t b a l l P l a y o f f s s e m i f i n a l a t t h e 1 1 0 t h R o s e B o w l G a m e o n N e w Y e a r ' s D a y .

Some like to whip out gory films like the \u201cEvil Dead,\u201d masked villain thrillers like \u201cScream\u201d or even more magic-based tales like that of the Sanderson Sisters in \u201cHocus Pocus.\u201d Just because we love to be scared around the holiday doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t enjoy a good laugh along the way, which is why we will be ranking the funniest horror movies you can watch this season! Whether it\u2019s the hilarious undead antics of \u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d or the zany supernatural adventures of \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d the funniest horror movies offer a perfect blend of scares and laughs. So grab some popcorn and get ready to giggle your way through these side-splitting horror flicks that will keep you entertained all season long. Watching funny horror movies is a great way to experience both the thrill of the scare and the laughter of comedy. These films often feature campy characters, over-the-top gore, and self-referential humor. While they may not be as scary as traditional horror movies, they can still be suspenseful and exciting. And of course, they\u2019re a lot of fun to watch. Some of the funniest horror movies of all time include \u201cShaun of the Dead,\u201d \u201cTucker & Dale vs. Evil,\u201d \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows,\u201d and \u201cZombieland.\u201d These films are all well-written and well-acted, and they feature some of the most memorable comedic moments in horror history. If you\u2019re looking for a good laugh, and you don\u2019t mind a few scares, be sure to check out some of these silly scary flicks. To get ready for spooky season, we at StudyFinds have researched across multiple expert sources to bring you today\u2019s list of the funniest horror movies of all time. Don\u2019t agree with our list? No worries, we would love to hear from you and your recommendations in the comments below! The List: Funniest Horror Movies, According to Fans 1. \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d (1988) The first spot on our list belongs to the \u201cghostest with the mostest,\u201d \u201cBeetlejuice.\u201d This quasi-horror film from the \u201980s is a must-watch for households every Halloween season, and this year should be no different! \u201cBeetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice! This Tim Burton classic is arguably one of the best funny scary films of all time. As soon as Michael Keaton\u2018s character starts talking, you\u2019ll understand why,\u201d raves Country Living. \u201cWhen recently deceased couple-turned-ghosts Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) need help getting the new inhabitants of their old house to move out, they call on \u2018Beetlejuice\u2019 (Michael Keaton), an over-the-top \u2018bio-exorcist\u2019 from the netherworld to scare them away,\u201d explains Good Housekeeping. \u201cBack when CGI was iffy, and stop-motion animation was all the rage, Tim Burton released this morbid comedy horror, and it was an instant hit. \u2018Beetlejuice\u2019 is a huge character who is played by Michael Keaton. I don\u2019t think I realized that until recently; there\u2019s not one hint of any other character that he has played before, which makes \u2018Beetlejuice\u2019 even more superb. A great movie to watch with older kids, as there are a few jumpy moments, sexual references, and a bit of gore. Nothing that they wouldn\u2019t have seen before if they\u2019re allowed to watch Game Of Thrones *shrugs*,\u201d says Sareta Fontaine. 2. \u201cScary Movie\u201d (2000) The second spot on our list is dedicated to the mother of all parody classics, \u201cScary Movie.\u201d I mean, come on, did anyone think we\u2019d make a list of the funniest horror movies and not include this one? \u201cA group of teenagers accidentally killed a man, and a year later, they\u2019re paying the price in this parody of some of pop culture\u2019s most famous horror films,\u201d notes Country Living. \u201cThrow it back with the first flick in the iconic \u2018Scary Movie\u2019 franchise, which parodies some of our fave horror films like \u2018Scream,\u2019 \u2018The Sixth Sense,\u2019 \u2018I Know What You Did Last Summer,\u2019 and \u2018The Blair Witch Project.\u2019 This hilarious movie also pokes fun at a ton of other teen movie clich\u00e9s across genres,\u201d explains Seventeen. \u201cEveryone loves a good parody, especially when it centers around an already popular horror story. Watch this comedy take on a group of friends who have to face justice on a gruesome crime they committed a year earlier,\u201d comments The Pioneer Woman. 3. \u201cGhostbusters\u201d (1984) \u201cWho you gonna call?\u201d No, seriously, I\u2019m having a bad ghost problem. Do you know anyone who could help? \u201cIn the 1984 classic, \u2018Ghostbusters,\u2019 three quirky parapsychologists \u2013 Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) \u2013 find themselves out of work. Unfazed, they establish a ghost removal service in New York City. When Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) reports a supernatural entity in her apartment, the Ghostbusters are thrust into a paranormal storm, battling an ancient Sumerian god, Gozer,\u201d describes Ranker. \u201c\u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 is the highest-grossing comedy of the 1980s and landed itself a spot on the National Film Registry for its cultural significance. It\u2019s been nearly four decades, and its popularity hasn\u2019t diminished, as shown by recent reboots. \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 received critical acclaim and was nominated for two Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Original Song,\u201d reports Creepy Catalog. \u201cName a better movie \u2014 any genre. I\u2019ll wait. Whether you go for the OG\u2019 Ghostbusters\u2019 with Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray, the funny new female-led version, or the even newer, slightly darker \u2018Ghostbusters: Afterlife,\u2019 they\u2019re all superb and relatively family-friendly,\u201d says Scary Mommy. 4. \u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d (2004) For the next spot of our ranking, we traveled across the pond to present the film \u201cShaun of the Dead.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to saving the world from hungry zombies, the last people you\u2019d expect to be your heroes are this trio of misfits. But, they take on each grueling creature at once, making for one hilarious battle,\u201d notes The Pioneer Woman. \u201c\u2018Shaun of the Dead\u2019 is a hilarious romp through apocalyptic London starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Directed by Edgar Wright, this zombie comedy follows the title character (played by Pegg), who is bummed after being dumped by his girlfriend, Liz, because he has no ambition and would rather slack around with his best friend, Ed. When people begin turning into zombies around him, he\u2019s completely oblivious at first, but Shaun eventually sees it as an opportunity to win back Liz,\u201d explains MovieWeb. \u201cFans love how this movie deconstructs the zombie genre, and it\u2019s shot and edited perfectly thanks to Edgar Wright\u2019s style. While it helps to have some familiarity with the way that these types of stories are told, any horror fan can definitely enjoy the light-hearted and funny tone,\u201d comments ScreenRant. 5. \u201cFreaky\u201d (2020) Last on our list is a more recent film that is sure to keep you side-splitting in laughs but at the edge of your seat, looking for all exits, if you know what we mean. May we present \u201cFreaky.\u201d \u201cVince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton star in this \u2018Freaky Friday\u2019-style slasher flick. Vaughn plays serial killer The Butcher, who swaps places with a high school student,\u201d describes Country Living. \u201cThe body-swapping comedy is nothing new. Soaking the subgenre\u2019s dynamic narrative in bloody carnage, however, is. Such is the case with Blumhouse\u2019s \u2018Freaky.\u2019 It stars a high school senior and serial killer who change places, lending their arcs to hilarity, chaos, and mayhem,\u201d writes Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cSeventeen-year-old Millie not only has to worry about surviving her senior year but actually surv\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: 15 Scary Movies Based On Books That Are Actually So Good, You're Going To Make A BuzzFeed Account Just To Get In The Comments And Thank Me For Recommending Them\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Hellooooo, everybody, and happy Halloween (almost).

Situated at the heart of Silicon Valley, this dynamic city offers more than just a hub for tech and innovation. Boasting a rich cultural fabric, diverse population, and a plethora of activities, San Jose truly has something for everyone. And the best part? Many of these experiences don't require a single penny. Despite its reputation for high living costs, San Jose is abundant in free adventures to suit all preferences. For nature enthusiasts, art aficionados, history enthusiasts, or those simply seeking unique experiences, San Jose does not disappoint. So, lace up those sneakers, pack a few snacks, and prepare to discover the array of free activities in San Jose, California. Enjoy an Evening at Sierra Vista There's something magical about ending a day at Sierra Vista. As the sun begins its descent, the world seems to pause and take a breath. Striking hues dance across the sky, painting the city in warm, golden tones. I always make it a point to arrive early to soak in the tranquil atmosphere and secure a parking spot, which can get quite crowded later. The sweeping panorama of the city below is truly a sight to behold. It's my retreat from the hustle and bustle of daily life - a chance to enjoy a moment of serenity. On lucky days, I've even spotted a couple of coyotes roaming the area - a thrilling sight. Sierra Vista never fails to impress, whether it's a Saturday evening unwinding session or a Sunday afternoon picnic. It's a place I love to share with others but also cherish in solitude. I hope you find your magic in Sierra Vista, just as I have. Marvel at the Blooms of the Municipal Rose Garden You wouldn't believe the tranquility you can experience just a few steps from the busy city streets of San Jose. The Municipal Rose Garden is my sanctuary, a vibrant 5.5-acre wonderland of roses where I've spent countless hours. When spring's first blush paints the city, I eagerly anticipate the garden's awakening. The transformation, as winter gives way to more than 180 rose varieties, is breathtaking. Likewise, the riot of colors, ranging from pastel shades to vibrant hues, is a sight to behold from April through November. The garden is more than just roses. For example, the massive trees offer ample shade on sunnier days, making it a perfect spot for family outings or solo trips. Often, I pack a picnic and head there with my kids. While they enjoy their playtime in the open spaces, I relish the serenity offered by the garden. The centerpiece \u2013 a mesmerizing fountain surrounded by benches, has been the site of many heart-to-heart chats with friends. Sitting there, enveloped by the sweet scent of blooming roses while watching the water softly cascade, is an experience that never gets old. And not to forget, the Rose Garden takes care of practical needs, too. The availability of washrooms and water taps adds to the convenience, ensuring a stress-free visit. For photography enthusiasts like me, this is a paradise. With its trellised roses and shrubs, the garden offers unique backdrops for capturing stunning photos. The Municipal Rose Garden, with its vibrant blooms and serene ambiance, has a unique way of rejuvenating your mind and soul. It's a gem that San Jose can proudly call its own. Visit Alum Rock Park It's hard to believe a place as serene and picturesque as Alum Rock Park exists just minutes away from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Jose. You genuinely feel like you are miles away from civilization. I visit the park frequently; it has become my sanctuary, my place for solitude and reflection. One of my favorite activities is hiking up to Eagle Rock Point. It's a light-level hike, perfect for the whole family. My kids always get a kick out of spotting wildlife along the trail. The panoramic view of downtown San Jose from Eagle Rock Point, particularly during sunset, is breathtaking. It's a sight you have to see for yourself. However, Alum Rock Park is more than just hiking trails. It also boasts mineral springs and several picnic spots. The lower part of the canyon is laden with little picnic areas, perfect for a quiet afternoon break or a family picnic. It's also a fantastic spot for mountain biking, especially on the canyon's Northside, which offers more exposure. Just remember to bring plenty of water and remember, no dogs are allowed. This place is a hidden treasure in our city, and if you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to check out Alum Rock Park. Step Back in Time at History Park San Jose I've been a resident of San Jose for over a decade, and I never cease to marvel at the history and cultural richness that this city offers. Nestled in the heart of San Jose is a gem that allows me to stroll down memory lane - History Park San Jose. This unique outdoor museum transports me back to different periods of our city's heritage every time I visit. The park has over 30 original and replicated buildings encapsulating the city's past. I love roaming around structures like the old firehouse, the blacksmith shop, and the intriguing Chinese temple. Each structure tells a captivating tale of the people who once inhabited this place and their contributions to molding the city's identity. Even more exciting are the various events, festivals, and exhibits hosted at History Park San Jose. Each serves as a vibrant celebration of our city's culture and history. For instance, I remember discovering that many of the city's early settlers were Portuguese. At one such festival, I experienced a taste of Portugal right here in San Jose! On a regular weekday, most buildings may be closed, but I enjoy simply walking around, soaking in the historical ambiance. It's not just about learning history but living it. You might want to plan your visit for a weekend to explore the interiors of these historical edifices. The park is a haven for history enthusiasts and an excellent spot for families and anyone intrigued by San Jose's rich heritage. There's also a free trolly ride, which is always a hit with the little ones! I'm proud to call San Jose home, and History Park is truly a testament to the city's remarkable past. Experiencing this slice of history amidst the bustling cityscape is a journey I look forward to each time I visit. Enjoy a Scenic Escape at Martial Cottle Park I've almost lost count of the times I've strolled through the open spaces of Martial Cottle Park. It's like a breath of fresh air for my usual urban surroundings, with picturesque views, walking and riding trails, and a delightful children\u2019s park\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Downtown San Jose Acquires The Tint Of Luxury\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: Mango hamachi sushi, scallops blushing with avocado tanginess, and glasses clinking with pomegranate gimlets; luxury has returned to downtown San Jose. The old Fairmont hotel is now a Signia hotel, Hilton\u2019s most prestigious brand. The doors open to a new lobby and a stylishly lit bar. Beyond it, the city\u2019s largest ballroom, the Imperial Ballroom, is getting set up for a wedding. Weddings at the Hilton Signia The festivities start with a mehndi sangeet. \u201cThe intimate mehndi dinners are held here,\u201d says Ritu Khurana, senior catering manager who oversees the weddings at the Hilton Signia. \u201cThis property is ideal for all sizes of functions,\u201d she says, walking into the chandeliered room with a step up area for guests who want a bird\u2019s eye view of the dancing. It is ideally located too; just a short drive from the nearby San Jose International airport. The downtown location of the hotel gives the visitors plenty to see and do. The San Jose Museum of Art (MOA) dominates the view from the windows of the coffee shop. Between the (MOA) and the Signia, is the Circle of Palms Plaza, a quadrangle with a ring of palm trees encircling a California State Seal, the California Historical Marker 461 marking the site of California\u2019s first state capital, San Jose. The groom, astride his white charger, follows the procession of the wedding band and the dancing guests to the Circle of Palms Plaza where they dance within the quadrangle. San Jose, the first capital of California When California became part of the USA in 1850, San Jose was the oldest civilian settlement dating back to 1777. At the 1849 state constitutional convention in Monterey, San Jose was chosen as the first state capital of California. The 1849 Assembly and Senate went down in history as the \u201cLegislature of a Thousand Drinks\u201d, a term attributed to Senator Thomas Jefferson Green of Sacramento, who ended each session with, \u201cLet\u2019s have a drink! Let\u2019s have a thousand drinks!\u201d Adjacent to the Circle of Palms Plaza, a two-story adobe hotel built around 1830 became the first state capitol and hosted the first legislative sessions in 1850 and 1851. At the Imperial Ballroom, the priest kindles the havan fire at just the right muhurat. The bride\u2019s party, through the windows of their suites, looks down upon the brightly painted The Tech Interactive Museum. Live Music at San Pedro\u2019s Square Down the street from the Signia, the sound of a live band wafts into the air. San Pedro\u2019s Square, an open air dining area, is filled with young professionals feasting on a smorgasbord of flavors from a fleet of eateries serving world cuisine. Dancers sway to thumping live music within a circle of twinkling lights in the courtyard. The Hammer theater and the beautiful California theater are also nearby for entertainment. In the square is one of Spanish California\u2019s oldest settlements, the Peralta Adobe built in 1797. It is the last remaining structure from El Pueblo de San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe, California\u2019s first civil settlement. The pueblo of San Jos\u00e9 was created to raise crops and livestock, and became one of the major sources of food for the two adjoining presidios, San Francisco and Monterey. Across the street is San Jose Mayor Thomas Fallon\u2019s home from 1855. San Jose State University, the oldest public university on the West Coast Around the corner from San Pedro Square is the oldest public university on the US West Coast and the founding campus of the California State University (CSU) system, the San Jose State University (SJSU). San Jose is considered the technology capital of the state and the SJSU, established in 1857, is among the leading providers of talent to Silicon Valley\u2019s technology firms. San Jose has a flourish of beautiful hotels downtown like the Westin, the Sheraton and the Hilton. While San Francisco has been favored as the city of choice for visitors and the Silicon Valley glitterati for long, lately an increase in crime in that city has generated a fear in the hearts of many visitors. In comparison, \u201cHosting a wedding is safer in San Jose than San Francisco,\u201d says Ritu Khurana.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: AMC Eastridge 15\nrating: 4.2\ncategory:\n- Movie theater\naddress: 2190 Eastridge Loop, San Jose, CA 95122\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Cinemark Cin\u00e9Arts Santana Row\nrating: 4.5\ncategory:\n- Movie theater\n- Snack bar\naddress: 3088 Olsen Dr, San Jose, CA 95128\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: CineLux Almaden Caf\u00e9 & Lounge\nrating: 4.5\ncategory:\n- Movie theater\naddress: 2306 Almaden Rd, San Jose, CA 95125\n----------------\nArticle No.: 6\ntitle: AMC Saratoga 14\nrating: 4\ncategory:\n- Movie theater\naddress: 700 El Paseo de Saratoga, San Jose, CA 95130\n----------------\nArticle No.: 7\ntitle: Cinemark Century Oakridge 20 XD and ScreenX\nrating: 4.5\ncategory:\n- Movie theater\n- Snack bar\naddress: '925 Blossom Hill Rd #2000, San Jose, CA 95123'\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Each offers a distinct dining experience that will tantalize your taste buds . 1 . Yokohama Yakitori Koubou Had a blast at Yokohama Yakitori Koubou ! The yakitori , especially the beef and chicken hearts , were a delight . I 'd suggest getting there early to beat the crowd . The beef curry , short rib skewer , and chicken gizzard skewers were standouts . The skewers were tender and the portions , though small , packed a punch of flavor . However , be prepared for a bit of noise as the place is quite bustling . Service can be a hit or miss , so patience might be required . Despite this , the food is worth the wait ! Address : 3904 Convoy St Consumer Studies , San Diego , CA 92111 Phone : (858)\u00a0277-8822 2 . Born and Raised Had an unforgettable experience at Born and Raised ! Perfect for special occasions , this place is a must-visit for steak lovers . The Wellington steak was divine , and the ambiance was cozy and inviting . The staff went above and beyond to make the experience memorable . The rooftop offers a stunning view of the city , adding to the charm . Do n't forget to try the meatball , Mac & cheese , potato pur\u00e9e , table side Caesar salad , and the chocolate cake . Remember to book in advance , as this place is quite popular ! Address : 1909 India St , San Diego , CA 92101 Phone : (619)\u00a0202-4577 3 . Shank & Had an amazing experience at Shank & ! The Vietnamese noodles and chicken wings were a delight . The BBQ beef , pork , and shrimp were tender and flavorful , perfectly marinated and grilled . The shrimp spring rolls were a hit too ! The presentation was impressive , with vibrant herbs adding a fresh touch . Also tried the Braised Catfish and the Filet Mignon Pho , both were delicious . The place can be a bit messy , so I 'd recommend visiting during the day . Plus , they have free parking !

As owner of Thee Bungalow Restaurant , Ed Moore had a successful wine club that soon outgrew it space . When Ed decided to close the original 3rd Corner Mediterranean Seafood restaurant , Ed gained the space needed for the wine club to grow . He also had a ready built restaurant that needed to be used . When he combined the wine club with the restaurant , the new 3rd Corner Wine Shop & Bistro was born . Ed never envisioned the success that was to come , he wanted a wine shop that served food and got a restaurant that sold wine . The 3rd Corner serves great food and our kitchens close at 1am ! This store offers a unique dining experience nestled within a bustling wine retail shop . With an extensive selection of wines available by the glass or bottle , customers are invited to pair their meal with a wine of their choice , for a reasonable corkage fee . While the food is generally well-received , some customers find the prices high for the value offered . The atmosphere is a blend of cozy and lively , with the option of dining on the outdoor patio . Customers appreciate the attentive service and the quality of the food , with the short rib and stuffed salmon being particular favorites . Despite some criticism regarding atmosphere and pricing , it is generally considered a hidden gem worth visiting . The store also offers special prix fix menus and even features a wine club .

In this post , we 'll explore six restaurants that capture the essence of the city 's food culture . 1 . Morning Glory Morning Glory is a trendy spot with a hip vibe , perfect for snapping some Instagram-worthy shots . Be prepared for a bit of a wait , but trust me , it 's worth it . The menu is a mix of classic American fare and unique additions that make the experience stand out . The staff is top-notch , and the food is delicious , though some dishes could use a bit of tweaking . The Mexican mocha coffee is a sweet treat . While it may not live up to all the hype for everyone , it 's definitely a unique spot to check out in San Diego . Address : 550 W Date St Suite # C , San Diego , CA 92101 Phone : (619)\u00a0629-0302 2 . Yokohama Yakitori Koubou My go-to spot during my undergrad years , Yokohama Yakitori Koubou , is a must-visit for authentic Japanese flavors . The grilled skewers , beef rice , and grilled fries are my top picks . The chicken liver and beef tongue skewers are a delight , and the spicy Japanese cucumber appetizer is a must-try . The udon and omelet are creamy and authentic , and the yakitori is simply amazing . Just a heads up , it can get busy , so making a reservation is a smart move . Trust me , you wo n't regret it ! Address : 3904 Convoy St Consumer Studies , San Diego , CA 92111 Phone : (858)\u00a0277-8822 3 . Monello Monello , nestled in the heart of Little Italy in San Diego , is a must-visit for any foodie . The ' spaghetti neri con polipo ' is a standout , with a delicious sauce and plenty of fresh octopus . The vegetarian pizza is another winner , boasting a fantastic tomato sauce and fresh ingredients . However , be prepared for a bit of a wait , as service can be slow . Also , if you 're looking forward to the cheese wheel pasta experience , make sure to remind your server . After your meal , take a leisurely stroll around Little Italy to cap off your night . Address : 750 W Fir St , San Diego , CA 92101 Phone : (619)\u00a0501-0030 4 . Barbusa Just had a delightful experience at Barbusa , a modern Sicilian gem nestled in the heart of Little Italy . The short rib lasagna and bone marrow pasta were a hit , and the Lollipop Chops appetizer was a flavor explosion . But the real star was the secret Barbusa Espresso Martini , a delightful surprise not even listed on the menu ! The atmosphere is lively , but be prepared for a bit of a wait due to its popularity . Also , they offer valet parking , a nice touch . A word of caution , though , the gnocchi was a bit of a letdown . Overall , a must-visit spot for Italian cuisine lovers ! Address : 1917 India St , San Diego , CA 92101 Phone : (619)\u00a0238-1917 5 . Bobboi Natural Gelato I recently visited Bobboi Natural Gelato and was blown away by their unique flavors , including the intriguing black charcoal ice cream . The gelato was the softest I 've ever had , super creamy and delightful . The salted caramel and cinnamon honey were simply divine . They also offer vegan and dairy-free options , which is a big plus . The ' Rose Honey ' flavor was particularly special , light , subtle , and well-balanced . While some may argue the flavors could be bolder , I found them to be just right . The staff was friendly and the atmosphere clean and inviting . Highly recommended for all gelato lovers ! Address : 2175 Kettner Blvd , San Diego , CA 92101 Phone : (858)\u00a0214-8240 6 . Communal Coffee Stepping into Communal Coffee , you 're greeted by a fresh , clean decor that 's perfect for a cozy read or a peaceful gaze at the sea . The place is a haven for coffee lovers , with unique offerings like the Sweet Mint Cold Brew and the Black Sesame Latte . The food , especially the avocado toast and blueberry scone , is a delight , though the portions could be more generous . The place also doubles as a shop , selling beautiful flowers and home goods . However , the service , particularly at the coffee bar , could use some improvement . Despite some minor issues , the overall experience is enjoyable and worth a visit .

The project began small as we started participating in Farmers Markets throughout San Diego . Over the years , we worked very hard on improving the empanadas ; from perfecting the dough and making it thin and crispy , to developing flavors that represent Argentina authentically yet still cater to the Californian palate . Liberty Public Market is our first permanent location . Located inside the bustling Liberty Public Market , this empanada spot is a must-visit for food lovers . With over ten different types of empanadas to choose from , it offers a variety of flavors to suit every palate . The Malbec Beef and Jackfruit Empanada come highly recommended , with the former being a crowd favorite . The eatery is small with both indoor and outdoor seating options , providing a casual and relaxed ambiance . The quick and easy ordering process , coupled with friendly and patient service , enhances the overall dining experience . Despite being busy , especially on weekends , the staff manages to serve warm , fresh , and delicious empanadas quickly . The empanadas are rich and heavy , making them a perfect snack or light meal . The complimentary dipping sauces , particularly the Chimichurri , add an extra layer of flavor to the already delicious empanadas . Popular Dishes Read Carissa L.

The counter is marble instead of linoleum and the wings come with chili-miso sauce and the blog buzz is deafening and the food and drinks are really , really good ; there is a certain ambition , a willful exceptional-ness on display here , one that runs completely counter to the diner ethos . All of which is perfectly fine because Hopscotch is patently not trying to be a diner , not even one of those cheesy upscale ones -- it 's a nice bar-restaurant with cloth napkins and all that aforementioned buzz . The food is gently Japanese-inflected ; the very-popular-in-its own right drinks program focuses heavily on beer and whiskey and elegant retoolings of classic cocktails ' E Cushing , EBX 11.14.12 A guide of exploration based on authentic user feedback : Hopscotch , located in the heart of Oakland , is a restaurant that offers a unique blend of classic American cuisine with an Asian twist .

The counter is marble instead of linoleum and the wings come with chili-miso sauce and the blog buzz is deafening and the food and drinks are really , really good ; there is a certain ambition , a willful exceptional-ness on display here , one that runs completely counter to the diner ethos . All of which is perfectly fine because Hopscotch is patently not trying to be a diner , not even one of those cheesy upscale ones -- it 's a nice bar-restaurant with cloth napkins and all that aforementioned buzz .

Until a few years ago, I didn\u2019t know it existed until one of my best friends moved there. A few years after that, I found myself working just on the border of the district at The Dancing Cat, a nonprofit cat rescue and San Jose\u2019s first cat lounge. Also known as J-town, Japantown is a historical area north of downtown San Jose, and while it has changed over the years, it\u2019s a hub of Japanese culture. With a combination of residential neighborhoods and small businesses from Japanese restaurants to unique gift shops, there\u2019s something for everyone. On my most recent visit, I spent the entire day exploring and couldn\u2019t get enough.

Enjoy an Evening at Sierra Vista There's something magical about ending a day at Sierra Vista. As the sun begins its descent, the world seems to pause and take a breath.

The restaurant is known for its delicious seasoning that is used on every skewer , which some customers find both amazing and slightly overwhelming . To accommodate large groups , it is recommended to make a reservation as the restaurant has limited seating . Aceking BBQ charges an 18 % gratuity for parties of four or more , which is important to consider when calculating the total cost of your meal . While some skewers may be pricey , the beef skewers and cucumber salad are definite must-haves . Loyal customers also highly recommend the chicken skin skewers , pig feet , and lamb kidney skewers . For vegetarian options , the chive skewers and eggplant slices are great choices . However , some items like pork skin , grilled cattle ligament , bee tripe , beef tendon , roasted quail , fish cakes , fish balls , and winkle skewers may not appeal to everyone . Additionally , the corn skewers are not recommended as they use waxy corns instead of sweet corn .

{"question_id": 1235, "turns": ["[INST] You are a smart AI assistant. Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:33AM\nGiven a question from a America user: National emergency declarations in 2023\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: End of the Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) Declaration\ndate: 2023-05-05\nbody: What You Need to Know The federal COVID-19 PHE declaration will end on May 11, 2023. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain available. CDC\u2019s ability to collect and share certain data will change. CDC is updating its guidance to align with data changes. May 11, 2023, marks the end of the federal COVID-19 PHE declaration. After this date, CDC\u2019s authorizations to collect certain types of public health data will expire. The United States has mobilized and sustained a historic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a nation, we now find ourselves at a different point in the pandemic \u2013 with more tools and resources than ever before to better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the agency\u2019s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to protect the nation\u2019s public health. What Does the End of the PHE Mean for You? Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain available. But, some tools, like certain data sources and reporting, will change. Vaccines will remain available. Access to COVID-19 vaccines will generally not be affected for now. The U.S. government is currently distributing free COVID-19 vaccines for all adults and children. To help keep communities safe from COVID-19, HHS remains committed to maximizing continued access to COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 at-home tests may not be covered by insurance. Insurance providers will no longer be required to waive costs or provide free COVID-19 tests. CDC\u2019s No Cost COVID-19 Testing Locator can help people find current community and pharmacy partners participating in the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) program. Treatments will remain available. Medication to prevent severe COVID-19, such as Paxlovid, will remain available for free while supplies last. After that, the price will be determined by the medication manufacturer and your health insurance coverage. Check with your healthcare provider if you need early treatment to prevent severe COVID-19. National reporting of COVID-19 may change. We have the right data for this phase of COVID-19 that will allow us to understand what\u2019s happening with the virus in America in real-time. Simply put, while what we have going forward will be different, it will still allow CDC, local public health officials, and the members of the public to understand COVID-19 dynamics at the community level. CDC\u2019s Data and Surveillance Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies remains a public health priority. With the COVID-19 PHE declaration ending, some metrics will remain the same, but some will change in frequency, source, or availability. This is in part because CDC\u2019s authority to collect and receive certain types of data will change.

The President took additional steps to address this national emergency in Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014. The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 2006, as amended by Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014, must continue in effect beyond October 27, 2023. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared in Executive Order 13413, as amended by Executive Order 13671.

Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia signed Executive Order (OE by its Spanish initials) 2023-032 on Sunday declaring a state of emergency in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo and Lo\u00edza due to flooding caused by ongoing heavy rain that set a daily record for October last Friday. \u201cIn the wake of the heavy rainfall activity that Puerto Rico faced on October 27, 2023, the National Weather Service [NWS] issued a flash flood warning for several municipalities. Downpour activity was concentrated in the northern and northwestern sectors,\u201d the OE states. \u201cParticularly, in the San Juan area, a record daily maximum rainfall of 5.20 inches was recorded. [The] torrential rains caused flooding, sinkholes and landslides in several towns. The Government of Puerto Rico has a constitutional responsibility to safeguard public order, and protect the life, property, and safety of all its residents.\u201d Through the OE, the governor authorizes the island public safety (DPS) secretary, Alexis Torres R\u00edos, to add to the emergency declaration any other municipality that he deems necessary. In addition, Pierluisi directed the DPS secretary, who is the State Coordinating Officer, to proceed with the necessary coordination to accept and use the federal assistance provided in response to requests generated by the Government of Puerto Rico and its municipalities. The emergency declaration meets the requirements for the General Services Administration (GSA), agencies, and municipalities to activate special emergency procurement procedures to procure essential materials and services to respond to the emergency. \u201cThe DSP will prepare and present to the governor, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the secretary of the Department of Treasury, and the director of the Puerto Rico Financial Advisory Authority and Fiscal Agency (AAFAF) an estimate of the funds required to carry out the evacuation, rescue, response, and recovery work in the affected regions,\u201d the OE indicates. \u201cThe foregoing will include those expenses incurred so far and those that will be incurred to carry out the aforementioned work.\u201d Once the estimate is made and submitted by the DPS, both the Treasury secretary and the OMB director will allocate the available funds to the agencies and municipalities they identify to comply with the provisions of the executive order. Article 5.10 of Act 20-2017, as amended, known as the \u201cPuerto Rico Department of Public Safety Act,\u201d empowers the governor to declare a state of emergency on the island. In addition to the flooding after Friday\u2019s record-setting rains, flash flooding and thunderstorms occurred in San Juan, as well as in the central, inland, southeastern and northern areas of Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, rip currents were particularly strong along the northern, western and eastern coasts of the island, and authorities closed the public beach in Carolina because of dangerous conditions. Unsettled weather conditions are forecast to continue early this week due to the interaction of an upper trough and a broad surface trough, followed by the arrival of an easterly disturbance. Flooding in urban areas and small streams, flash flooding, and landslides in areas of steep terrain remain likely. A flash flood watch remains in effect today and may be extended.

Netanyahu declared on Monday that Israel's fierce offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip has \u201conly started.\u201d Netanyahu delivered the pronouncement in a nationally televised address as Israel pressed ahead with a third day of heavy airstrikes in Gaza following Hamas' unprecedented and deadly incursion into Israel Saturday. This is a developing story and will be updated.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: N.J. declares state of emergency as flooding from torrential rain worsens\ndate: 2023-09-30\nbody: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday declared a state of emergency in New Jersey as heavy rain continues to fall and parts of the state have been hit with severe flooding. The declaration takes effect at 3 p.m., Murphy said. Early rainfall totals show a month\u2019s worth of rain has fallen in several hours. The governor also announced closure of state offices at 3 p.m. That does not include essential employees or emergency personnel, Murphy said, noting that private companies should dismiss employees \u201cat their own discretion.\u201d \u201cThroughout the state, especially in the north and central regions, we are experiencing heavy rainfalls resulting in hazardous conditions, and the rainfall is expected to accelerate in many parts of the state over the next several hours,\u201d Murphy said in a statement. \u201cFlooding remains a significant concern due to the heavy rains much of the state already experienced this week. Residents should stay off the roads, remain alert, and follow all safety protocols.\u201d States of emergencies do not ban people from the roads or require them to shelter in place. Instead, they allow the state to organize its emergency response and to become eligible for federal disaster aid. Still, during an unrelated event in West Caldwell earlier Friday, Murphy said residents shouldn\u2019t be fooled by calmer weather this afternoon, stressing the storm is set to get worse later in the day. \u201cI\u2019m begging people if you don\u2019t have to go out, don\u2019t go out,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, please, please be careful.\u201d A widespread 1-2 inches of rain have fallen across most of New Jersey, with localized amounts of 3 to 4 inches in Ocean and Monmouth counties, the National Weather Service said at about noon. Minor flooding is already underway at the Barnegat Bay and along the banks of parts of the Passaic, Rockaway an Saddle rivers in Northern New Jersey. The statewide state of emergency follows a similar one issued for Hoboken earlier by the Hudson County city\u2019s mayor. Forecasters say 2.4 inches of rain fell in Hoboken by 9:30 a.m. Widespread flooding in Hudson County took place Friday morning and was ongoing this afternoon. Asbury Park has picked up 4.39 inches of rain as of 11:45 a.m. with Monmouth Beach recording 4.19. More than 3 inches has already fallen in Ocean Township, Neptune City and Bradley Beach, the weather service said. The state Board of Public Utilities warned off further power outages. As of 12:40 p.m. less than 700 homes and businesses were without power, though. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com.

In a strongly worded statement, Narendra Modi condemned the \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d and said India \u201cstands in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour\u201d. The Indian foreign minister retweeted the comment almost instantly. Another state minister from Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) warned in a tweet that India \u201cmay face the situation that Israel is confronting today if we don\u2019t stand up against politically motivated radicalism\u201d. Though Modi\u2019s words chimed with the messaging of most western governments, for India they marked a departure from the past. It was not until a few days later that the foreign ministry quietly reminded the public of India\u2019s historical commitment to the two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. On Friday, India was among the countries that did not back a UN resolution for a \u201chumanitarian truce\u201d in Gaza , instead choosing to abstain. For many, the immediacy of Modi\u2019s comments and the UN resolution vote symbolises just how significantly the India-Israel relationship has shifted since he came to power in 2014, notably demonstrated by the public bonhomie between the two countries\u2019 prime ministers. Nicolas Blarel, associate professor of international relations at Leiden University and author of The Evolution of India\u2019s Israel Policy, said: \u201cModi\u2019s position has been openly supportive of Israel but this is the first time that you had an immediate pro-Israel reaction without a balancing statement that immediately follows it up.\u201d Israel appeared to take Modi\u2019s statement as unequivocal backing. Speaking to reporters in Delhi last week, Israel\u2019s ambassador, Naor Gilon, thanked the country for \u201c100% support\u201d. Yet it was not a sentiment restricted only to the upper echelons of Indian government. As Azad Essa, a journalist and author of Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, said: \u201cThis messaging gave a clear signal to the whole rightwing internet cell in India.\u201d \u2018We both are victims of Islamic terror\u2019 In the aftermath, the Indian internet factcheckers AltNews and Boom began to observe a flood of disinformation targeting Palestine pushed out by Indian social media accounts, which included fake stories about atrocities committed by Palestinians and Hamas that were shared sometimes millions of times, and often using the conflict to push the same Islamophob\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Israel pushes deeper into Gaza and frees Hamas captive; Netanyahu rejects calls for cease-fire\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: The Israel-Hamas war has robbed people in Gaza of proper funeral rites as they face overcrowded cemeteries and overwhelmed morgues. KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Israeli ground forces pushed deeper into Gaza on Monday, advancing in tanks and other armored vehicles on the territory\u2019s main city and freeing a soldier held captive by Hamas militants. The Israeli prime minister rejected calls for a cease-fire, even as airstrikes landed near hospitals where thousands of Palestinians are sheltering beside the wounded. The military said a female soldier captured during Hamas\u2019 brutal Oct. 7 incursion was rescued in Gaza \u2014 the first since the weekslong war began. It provided few details, but said in a statement that Pvt. Ori Megidish \u201cis doing well\u201d and had met with her family. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed her home, saying the \u201cachievement\u201d by Israel\u2019s security forces \u201cillustrates our commitment to free all the hostages.\u201d He also rejected calls for a cease-fire to facilitate the release of captives or end the war, which he has said will be long and difficult. \u201cCalls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas,\u201d he told a press conference. \u201cThat will not happen.\u201d He also said he has no plans to resign in the face of mounting anger over the failure of Israel\u2019s vaunted security forces to prevent the worst surprise attack on the country in a half century. Hamas and other militant groups are believed to be holding some 240 captives, including men, women and children. Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure to secure their release even as Israel wages a punishing war it says is aimed at crushing Hamas and ending its 16-year rule over the territory. Hamas, which has released four hostages, has said it would let the others go in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including many implicated in deadly attacks on Israelis. Israel has dismissed the offer, and Netanyahu said the ground invasion \u201ccreates the possibility\u201d of getting the hostages out, adding that Hamas will \u201conly do it under pressure.\u201d Hamas released a short video Monday purporting to show three other female captives. One of the women delivers a brief statement \u2014 likely under duress \u2014 criticizing Israel\u2019s response to the hostage crisis.

On Sunday night, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) called out U.S. officials for what she called their \u201cdouble standard\u201d of unconditionally supporting Israel in its war against the Hamas militant group while condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThe United States rightly called out Russia for its siege of Ukraine, rightly called out the attacks on the power infrastructure, the refusal to provide food and water and fuel to the Ukrainians,\u201d Jayapal told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cWe have to recognize that our credibility and our authority on the moral stage is greatly diminished if we do not also call out this siege that Israel is launching on Gaza.\u201d It\u2019s been a struggle for humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip, a walled territory with 2.3 million Palestinian residents, since Israel\u2019s widespread retaliation began following Hamas\u2019 surprise attack that killed some 1,400 Israelis on Oct. 7. At first, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government entirely blocked humanitarian assistance like food, water and medical supplies from entering Gaza. Israel started allowing shipments after a 10-day siege that drew international pressure, though they\u2019ve been delayed since the aid is inspected for potential weapons that Hamas could smuggle in. Israel also faced criticism over the weekend after intense airstrikes caused a communications blackout in Gaza . Russia has consistently targeted Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, as well as its grain facilities and ports, with airstrikes. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby pushed back on Jayapal\u2019s comparison, saying that Russia, unlike Israel, deliberately targets Ukrainian civilians as part of Moscow\u2019s war strategy. \u201cSlaughtering innocent Ukrainians, that\u2019s part of their strategy inside Ukraine. That is not what we\u2019re seeing from Israel,\u201d Kirby said on CNN Monday morning. \u201cIsrael is not deliberately trying to kill civilians.\u201d But Palestinian civilians have been killed, Kirby emphasized. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, more than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7.

The exchange took place during the White House press briefing when Fox News' Peter Doocy asked Jean-Pierre over whether President Biden saw those protestors as \"extremists.\" \"What I can say is \u2014 what we've been very clear about this when it comes to antisemitism, there is no place.

Speaker Mike Johnson emphasizes the need to find payment sources, rejecting the idea of merely printing money. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, push for a more inclusive aid package that also benefits other nations, including Ukraine. House Republicans have proposed a new aid package to support Israel, particularly in its conflict with Hamas. This package, amounting to $14.3 billion, is largely earmarked for military aid and seeks to bolster Israel's defenses, especially as it carries out a ground invasion of the Gaza strip against Hamas. However, the financing for this package is contentious, as it is proposed to be sourced from funds previously allocated to the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act. Such a move is expected to be a sticking point for Democrats. Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader from New York, has hinted that the Democrat-led Senate is unlikely to approve of emergency aid packages that only focus on one nation, emphasizing the need for a more inclusive aid strategy that benefits countries like Ukraine. Echoing this sentiment, Speaker Mike Johnson stated on Fox News, \"We're going to have pay for it. We're not just going to print money and send it overseas.\" Johnson, while acknowledging the importance of the IRS, believes that supporting Israel, especially in ensuring the protection of innocent lives, is of immediate national interest. This bill, while supported by some, has faced opposition from various quarters. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., have voiced their disagreements, while Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz, Fla., has expressed concerns about the bill's political implications. Rep. Richie Neal, a prominent Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, criticized the Republicans for their stance on IRS funding, noting the agency's recent successes in recovering unpaid taxes. The backdrop to this political debate is the ongoing conflict in Israel. Hamas initiated an unexpected attack that resulted in significant Israeli casualties. Israel retaliated with missile strikes and has since begun a ground invasion. Communications in Gaza were disrupted due to Israeli bombardments but have been restored.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:33AM\nGiven a question from a America user: National security and defense budget allocations\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Finland\u2019s 2024 defense budget targets arms restocking, border security\ndate: 2023-10-13\nbody: HELSINKI \u2014 Finland\u2019s 2024 defense budget is primed to include funds meant to strengthen the country\u2019s 830-mile-long border with Russia as well as replenish military equipment and weapons supplied to Ukraine over the last two years. The budget, which is on course to be ratified by the end of October, puts defense spending at about \u20ac6.2 billion (U.S. $6.6 billion) \u2014 a nearly 5% rise from 2023. The Defence Ministry approved the draft budget with amendments in September. The elevated level of spending is directly linked to Finland\u2019s accession to NATO as well as heightened tension in the region following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The expected budget increases Finland\u2019s defense spending to 2.3% of its gross domestic product, lifting it above NATO\u2019s 2% goal for member states. A border-reinforcement plan embedded in the 2024 budget includes the construction of 125 miles of so-called smart fencing supported by advanced sensors and drones operated by the Finnish Border Guard. The smart fence, erected at strategic points along the Finnish-Russian border, costs between $400 million and $500 million. The budget also includes a $272 million reimbursement to the ministry to cover the cost of replacing military equipment and weapons donated to Ukraine. The formalized budget will provide the Finnish military with $1.6 billion to spend on materiel procurement in 2024. Finnish Defence Minister Antti H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen described the budget increase as \u201cfundamental to national security and enhancing defense capability.\u201d \u201cWe cannot ignore how the war instigated by Russia has changed the security landscape in our Nordic region and in the wider neighborhood. The world around Finland is becoming an increasingly dangerous place. Despite Finland\u2019s economic challenges, we are now part of NATO and with membership comes added costs and responsibilities,\u201d H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen said. Although Russia\u2019s defense-industrial base is in overdrive and the country is expanding its military bases along Finland\u2019s border, H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen said the government does not feel under threat. Russia\u2019s Alakurtti base, which is east of the Finnish border region of Lapland, houses the Russian Army\u2019s arctic motor rifle brigade. And construction efforts at the Petrozavodsk base, south of Alakurtti, include work on a large military storage site and new buildings to house tanks, armored transport vehicles and mobile artillery pieces. Based on Finnish Army intelligence, movements to and from Petrozavodsk suggest the base is being used as a regional depot to deliver equipment to Russian front-line motorized brigade forces attacking Ukraine. \u201cRussia repeatedly warned us that it would strengthen its near-border bases if Finland joined NATO. We are not surprised by these activities. Our intelligence is that these new structural works at military bases are part of normal Russian operations. We do not believe they pose a threat,\u201d H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen said. Finland spent about $3.87 billion on defense in 2020, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which cites the figures in current prices, converted at the exchange rate for the given year. The next year, Finland spent about $3.8 billion on defense, followed by $4.8 in 2022, the Swedish think tank reported. Its 2023 defense budget was about $6.3 billion.

The adjustments result in an increase of budget expenditures by UAH 322.6 billion ($11.8 billion), as informed by MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak. The ratified draft law outlines increased funding for various ministries and departments, with a significant portion allocated to the security and defense sector. Roksolana Pidlasa, the budget committee head, revealed that the bill (No. 10038) passed after intense debates, amplifies state budget expenses by UAH 317.1 billion ($11.6 billion). Of this amount, a substantial part (UAH 302.6 billion or $11 billion) is directed towards the security and defense sector. This increase is primarily financed by a rise in government borrowing (UAH 290.7 billion or $10.6 billion). The Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Social Policy are among the major beneficiaries of this boosted funding, with increments of UAH 211 billion ($7.7 billion), UAH 79 billion ($2.9 billion), and UAH 16.5 billion ($603 million) respectively. Other departments such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Main Intelligence Directorate, State Security Administration will also see their budgets rise by UAH 1.3 billion ($47 million), UAH 2.5 billion ($91 million), and UAH 230.5 million ($8.4 million) respectively. Additional funding has also been allocated for the Ministry of Strategic Industries (UAH 4.3 billion or $157 million), Ministry of Education (UAH 572 million or $20.9 million), and the Economic Security Bureau (UAH 219 million or $8 million). Furthermore, the State Service for Special Communications and the Foreign Intelligence Service will receive enhancements of UAH 570 million ($20.8 million) and UAH 500 million ($18.3 million) respectively. The Ministry of Energy will also experience a surge in funding by UAH 350 million ($12.8 million). Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko attributed this surge in military campaign funding to support from businesses, taxpayers, and war bonds placement, underlining the urgency of these budget amendments. He emphasized that international aid cannot be funneled towards military uses. The changes also cover allowances for military personnel, special equipment procurement, defense industry development programs, provisions for internally displaced persons, textbooks for schools, and funding for National Guard, State Border Guard Service, Security Service of Ukraine, Foreign Intelligence Service, and State Special Communications. These budgetary adjustments, approved by the Cabinet on September 12, set a record as they push total budget expenditures over UAH 3.39 trillion ($124 billion) and widen the deficit beyond UAH 2 trillion ($73 billion).

Last month, half of House Republicans voted for an amendment to cut funding to CISA by 25%. In the US Senate, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has blocked cybersecurity legislation at least 11 times over concerns that CISA and its parent, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), are censoring free speech. Those legislative efforts are already hampering CISA from taking care of its responsibilities, and any deep cuts could disrupt its hard-won progress, says Josh Corman, former chief strategist for the COVID Task Force at CISA. \"I think cuts would be pretty catastrophic,\" Corman says. \"We are seeing increasing attack density across the 16 critical-infrastructure sectors. They should be growing the budget to handle those attacks, not cutting back.\" Among its efforts, CISA has embarked on extensive outreach to private industry, software makers, and cybersecurity firms. The agency releases dozens of advisories and guidance documents every month, such as a September warning covering the Snatch ransomware-as-a-service operation, and maintains a list of known exploited vulnerabilities that has become a boon for patch prioritization. CISA has also taken a major role in partnering with the software industry and open source communities to improve the security of open source software, even releasing its own tools for cyber defenders. Finally, the agency has committed to helping \"target rich, cyber poor\" organizations, such as small and midsize businesses and state and local governments. Any funding cuts would reverse a history of bipartisan budget increases for CISA over the five years of its existence. For the latest fiscal year, Congress passed a $2.9 billion budget for 2023, up from $2 billion in 2020. The Biden administration requested $3.1 billion for the agency for 2024, allocating about 58% of the funds for the Cybersecurity Division, about 25% for missions support and basic services, 8% for integrating operations with state, local, and tribal partners, and 6% for infrastructure security, according to written testimony by CISA Director Jen Easterly to the House Appropriations Committee. Overall, CISA has been fairly successful in getting programs up and running and in becoming a central resource for the federal government and critical infrastructure sectors, says Benjamin Jensen, a senior fellow with the Future War, Gaming, and Strategy group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"Do not underestimate even just the bureaucratic effort to set the organization up and to align the funding to build the workforce to ... scale up the number of crisis response, critical infrastructure, and attack games they run,\" he says. \"The interagency coordination has been a monumental challenge.\" Critical Infrastructure Needs CISA Since its creation in 2018, CISA has had to fight against both entrenched bureaucratic cultures and a tight cybersecurity labor market \u2014 forces that have hindered its effort to become a central repository of cybersecurity knowledge and a central service provider for both the federal government and critical infrastructure operators. In 2022, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the agency had provided benefits to its stakeholders but needed to work more toward improving critical infrastructure protection efforts and its cybersecurity services. How much budget cuts would hamper the agency's successful efforts with cybersecurity advisories, vulnerability management, and open source software security remains uncertain, but a lack of funds would certainly\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: DOD intel budget nearly $28B for FY-23\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: The Defense Department's fiscal year 2023 military intelligence program budget was nearly $28 billion, according to a Pentagon announcement. \u201cThe department has determined that releasing this topline figure does not jeopardize any classified activities within the MIP,\u201d DOD said, noting that \u201c[n]o other MIP budget figures or program details will be released, as they remain classified for national security reasons.\u201d The Pentagon had requested $26.3 billion for MIP in FY-23, while Congress enacted $24 billion for FY-22.

The group has tracked the federal support states have received and spent through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund. The fund has been supported by three separate tranches of federal money, each with its own deadline to spend the dollars. Connecticut has already spent 99% of the first portion, which was funded by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and comes with an extended April 1, 2024 deadline, according to the group. The state has spent 84% of the second pot of money, funded by the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, and has around $78.5 million left to spend before an extended March 31, 2025 deadline. Meanwhile, the state has spent only 41% of the final tranche, funded by the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act. That leaves nearly $650 million for districts to spend before a deadline in early 2025 or March of 2026 if the state receives a federal extension. According to the School + State Finance Project\u2019s analysis, Connecticut\u2019s spending from each pot of money is comparable to that of the nearby states of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island. The group has also sought to track how Connecticut districts have spent the funds and has found that their priorities have shifted during the course of the pandemic. While districts top spending priorities for the first portion of funds were supplies and property, districts have spent most of the second and third funding installments on personal services salaries. All told, nearly 53% of all reported expenditures under the fund have gone toward paying educator salary and benefits, according to the School + State Finance Project. Local districts\u2019 reliance on federal support, as well as the approaching deadlines for spending the remaining funds, have the group and some Connecticut educational policymakers worried about a coming fiscal cliff for local school districts. In February, the School + State Finance Project was among advocates pushing for legislation that would have resulted in an additional $275 million in state funding by expediting scheduled increases in the state grants to local districts. The bill did not pass. However, the two-year state budget proposal that did pass included $150 million\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Debt ceiling deal: What\u2019s in, what\u2019s out of the bill to avert US default\ndate: 2023-05-28\nbody: WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The details of the deal between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy were released Sunday in the form of a 99-page bill that would suspend the nation\u2019s debt limit through 2025 to avoid a federal default while limiting government spending. The Democratic president and Republican speaker are trying to win over lawmakers to the plan in time to avert a default that would shake the global economy. But Congress will be scrutinizing and debating the legislation, which also includes provisions to fund medical care for veterans, change work requirements for some recipients of government aid and streamline environmental reviews for energy projects. McCarthy said the House will vote on the legislation Wednesday, giving the Senate time to consider it before June 5, the date when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States could default on its debt obligations if lawmakers did not act in time. Some hardline conservatives have expressed early concerns that the compromise does not cut future deficits enough, while Democrats have been worried about proposed changes to work requirements in programs such as food stamps. With the details of the deal now clear, here\u2019s what\u2019s in and out: TWO-YEAR DEBT LIMIT SUSPENSION, SPENDING LIMITS The agreement would keep nondefense spending roughly flat in the 2024 fiscal year and increase it by 1% the following year, as well as suspend the debt limit until January 2025 -- past the next presidential election. For the next fiscal year, the bill matches Biden\u2019s proposed defense budget of $886 billion and allots $704 billion for nondefense spending. The bill also requires Congress to approve 12 annual spending bills or face a snapback to spending limits from the previous year, which would mean a 1% cut. The legislation aims to limit federal budget growth to 1% for the next six years, but that provision would not be enforceable starting in 2025. Overall, the White House estimates that the plan would reduce government spending by at least $1 trillion, but official calculations have not yet been released. VETERANS CARE The agreement would fully fund medical care for veterans at the levels included in Biden\u2019s proposed 2024 budget blueprint, including a fund dedicated to veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances or environmental hazards. Biden sought $20.3 billion for the toxic exposure fund in his budget.

The largest slice of the supplemental spending request ($23.5 billion) goes toward aiding areas affected by natural disasters this year. A summary of the package specifically mentioned the Maui wildfires, hurricanes in Florida and floods in California and Vermont. The request also includes $16 billion for child care, $6 billion to extend free and discounted high-speed internet, $1.6 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and $1.55 billion for grants that provide treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services against opioids, including fentanyl. The spending package would cover the 2024 fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1, 2023, and ends on Sept. 30, 2024. The federal government is also set to run out of funding on Nov. 17 absent action from Congress. The administration's request came hours after House Republicans elected Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., as speaker. The position was vacant for 22 days following Rep. Kevin McCarthy's, R-Calif., ouster. Biden also requested a $105 billion supplemental package last week geared towards national security concerns, including aid for Ukraine and Israel and funding for U.S.-Mexico border security. The White House previously sent a $40 billion emergency funding request to Congress for aid to Ukraine, border and migration management and disaster relief. While lawmakers did not pass the full request, they did approve $16 billion in disaster aid the administration requested as part of a stopgap funding bill to keep the government open until Nov. 17.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: White House wants $56 billion from Congress for disaster relief, child care and high-speed Internet\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is asking lawmakers for nearly $56 billion in emergency spending to help the government respond to natural disasters, shore up funding for child care centers and keep high-speed internet running for low-income families \u2014 outlining President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic priorities as Congress simultaneously weighs sending billions for conflicts abroad. The largest portion of the supplemental funding request, sent to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, includes more than $23 billion for disaster relief, as the Biden administration continues to aid communities across the U.S. devastated by wildfires, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes. The package also includes $16 billion to help scores of child care centers operate for another year, as well as $6 billion to extend free and discounted internet through December 2024, according to the White House. Other asks included in the $56 billion request are international food aid, energy assistance for low-income households and pay for federal wildland fighters. Wednesday\u2019s package is on top of the separate, nearly $106 billion request the Biden administration made last week for aid to Ukraine and Israel, as well as other national security priorities. The White House says the request for additional disaster relief \u2013 parsed out among the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies that cover housing, transportation and agriculture needs \u2013 is based on estimates from communities that have been hit by disasters this year, such as the August wildfires in Hawaii, hurricanes in Florida and flooding in California and Vermont, among other extreme weather events. President Joe Biden has repeatedly traveled to disaster-ravaged zones this year to comfort victims and to pledge that the federal government would not only help with recovery efforts but in rebuilding communities. \u201cAs I told your governor: If there is anything your state needs, I\u2019m ready to mobilize that support \u2014 anything they need related to these storms,\u201d Biden said as he visited Live Oak, Fla., in September, where Hurricane Idalia tore through the community. \u201cYour nation has your back, and we\u2019ll be with you until the job is done.\u201d The biggest portion of the $23.5 billion in Biden\u2019s disaster request is $9 billion to beef up FEMA\u2019s disaster relief fund, which the agency taps for immediate response and recovery efforts once a natural disaster hits. That fund currently has $33.7 billion available, according to FEMA. About $2.8 billion is set aside for the Department of Housing and Urban\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: New Speaker Johnson faces major health policy decisions in government funding bills\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: N ewly elected Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) will be facing significant challenges in healthcare policy as he leads the lower chamber through spending negotiations as fiscal tensions mount. On Thursday, Johnson announced his legislative priorities regarding the remainder of the appropriations bills that will need to be passed to fund the federal government. Johnson has said, however, that he would like to pass a short-term extension of government funding if necessary to avoid a government shutdown by the Nov. 17 deadline set last month to allow for more time to build consensus. NOVEMBER TO REMEMBER: RANKED CHOICE VOTING TAKES CENTER STATE IN SALT LAKE CITY MAYORAL RACE Bills relating to the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services will be saved for the week of Nov. 13, which some analysts say is to ensure that there is enough time to work through the controversies surrounding abortion in several of the funding measures. Johnson is a well-known anti- abortion advocate who has signed onto several bills that would place federal limits on the controversial procedure, but he has less of a profile with respect to the bread-and-butter appropriations issues regarding public health. There are three essential areas of public health funding Johnson will need to manage in the coming weeks. The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act Differing priorities between the House and the Senate on the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act will continue to put pressure on Johnson in avoiding a shutdown. First enacted in 2006 and then reauthorized in 2019 shortly before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bill is intended to provide the foundation for national biosecurity policy and emergency public health response. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee expanded some of the provisions of the act in July, including efforts to increase accountability for various government entities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health . The Senate's version of the bill also contained language regarding ensuring that the strategic national stockpile of emergency medical supplies, including medicines, is more responsive to market demands to avoid shortages in periods of crisis. In August, a group of 19 Republican lawmakers pressured then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) into significant cutbacks in the law in an effort to rein in some of the policies utilized during the pandemic. \u201cHouse Republicans should not bring such legislation to the floor for consideration either at all, or\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:33AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Impact of national economic stimulus package\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: What the COVID Experience Teaches About Designing a New Stimulus Package\ndate: 2023-08-21\nbody: The COVID pandemic caused sharp and deep setbacks to the U.S. economy, but it bounced back dramatically with the fiscal and monetary stimulus that followed. A new paper by experts at Wharton and elsewhere has analyzed the stimulus programs to understand why \u201cthe U.S. economy behaved unusually during and after the 2020 COVID recession\u201d in four areas: economic output, inflation, house prices, and unemployment. The paper, titled \u201cPrinting Away the Mortgages: Fiscal Inflation and the Post-COVID Housing Boom,\u201d is authored by Wharton finance professors William Diamond and Tim Landvoigt, and Penn economics doctoral student German Sanchez Sanchez. The authors paired data on the four areas they tracked with a model they designed to \u201cunderstand and decompose\u201d the various channels by which the stimulus programs shaped the post-COVID economy. Standard macro models are not designed to capture the unusual outcomes of the COVID stimulus programs, Diamond said. \u201cBut given that we\u2019ve seen those outcomes, we ask the question: What unusual aspects do we have to put into our otherwise standard model to make sense of what happened?\u201d The findings of the paper could also help policymakers refine their responses to future economic upheavals. A Steep Fall, Then a Steep Climb The paper listed the four key dimensions in which the U.S. economy behaved unusually: First, immediately after COVID was declared a pandemic in March 2020, unemployment had spiked dramatically to 14%, and then rapidly reverted to a 6% rate in 2021; it then continued to decline. Second, inflation was moderately low during 2020, after which it surged in 2021 and 2022 to a peak of 9% by July 2022; it has since fallen to about 3% as of July 2023. Third, house prices saw a rapid boom as they moved in tandem with the inflation spikes that followed the stimulus injections. A huge liquidity boost made up the fourth aspect, where overall money supply (or M2, which includes cash and bank deposits) surged from $15 trillion at the start of 2020 to more than $21 trillion in 2022. The government and the Fed had intervened with \u201clarge-scale deficit spending, a massive increase in the supply of liquid assets, and loose conventional monetary policy,\u201d the paper noted. The U.S. ran its largest primary deficits (before interest payments) on record in 2020 and 2021 of $2.5 trillion a year, largely because of generous direct cash transfers to households and unemployment insurance. The government also helped struggling households with a moratorium on home foreclosures and evictions, and supported businesses with loan programs. The Federal Reserve bought most of the debt those deficits created, thereby increasing its debt holdings from $2.6 trillion to $6.2 trillion. The Fed financed those purchases by increasing the supply of bank reserves from $1.7 trillion\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Child Tax Credit & Stimulus Checks Had Historical Impact On Adjusting The Economic Playing Field\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: According to a recent assessment from the U.S. Dept of the Treasury, economic stimulus programs implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic helped create \u201cthe most equitable rebound in recent history.\u201d In terms of their work on the financial security of minority groups, this is particularly true. New research from the Treasury Department and fresh data from the Fed Reserve Board were both included in the study, which was published on October 23. Its conclusions included the fact that the Biden administration\u2019s programs \u201chelped to prevent the worst economic results predicted from the COVID jolt for Black and Hispanic families.\u201d Additionally, it was discovered that Black & Hispanic families\u2019 financial standing has \u201cremained strong\u201d in comparison to recent economic recoveries across a range of economic metrics. In a news release, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said, \u201cThis report shows that, while the Biden administration initiatives have contributed to a historic economic rebound, we\u2019ve also been building the economy we need for the long term one that allows all communities to reach their economic potential.\u201d American Rescue Plan The paper claims that President Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 American Rescue Plan \u201ceffectively delivered resources and aid\u201d to previously underrepresented neighborhoods, assisting in the economy\u2019s faster-than-average recovery. Remembering that the report was written before a year of election in which Joe Biden is running for re-election is important. It does, meanwhile, provide a wealth of information to back up its assertions that the country made a \u201chistorically equitable recovery\u201d from the pandemic. By the American Rescue Plan, the federal government distributed stimulus checks of $500 billion, with each qualified citizen receiving up to $1,400 in cash. After the administration of Donald Trump oversaw the first & second stimulus rounds, that marked the third (as well as largest) batch of stimulus checks. The American Rescue Plan additionally raised the earned income tax credit, child and dependent care credit, and child tax credit, all of which contributed to a decrease in the country\u2019s child poverty rate. Unemployment Rates Were Lower Black & Hispanic rates of unemployment were less compared to as they were at that same point in prior recoveries within 20 months of the COVID recession peak, and they have remained lower through the most recent statistics. The disparities in employment rates across various ethnic groups have \u201cclosed substantially\u201d and are currently close to their historical lows. Black, Hispanic, and white homeownership rates increased by 2.9, 1.2, & 1.1 percentage points, respectively, between 2019 and 2022. This took place despite rising interest rates that pushed up mortgage rates to all-time highs. In contrast, homeownership rates decreased during the Great Crisis and increased less for households of color in 2001 during both the crisis and the subsequent economic recovery. The percentages of Black and Hispanic company owners have grown to their greatest recorded levels of 11% and 9.8%, respectively, up 6.2 & 2.8 percentage points. These were the biggest increases recorded in the Study of Consumer Finances\u2019 history.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Stimulus Checks, Child Tax Credit Had Historic Impact on Leveling Economic Playing Field \u2014 7 Key Takeaways from New Treasury Report\ndate: 2023-10-24\nbody: Economic stimulus programs rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to \u201cthe most equitable recovery in recent history,\u201d according to a new report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. This is especially true in terms of their contributions to the financial well-being of minority groups. See: 10 US Cities That Are Running Out of Jobs and Cheap Housing Learn: What To Do If You Owe Back Taxes to the IRS The report, released on Oct. 23, included new Treasury Department research alongside new data released by the Federal Reserve Board. Among its findings was that programs initiated by the Biden administration \u201chelped to thwart the worst economic outcomes anticipated from the COVID shock for Black and Hispanic families.\u201d It also found that across various economic indicators, the financial health of Black and Hispanic families has \u201cremained strong\u201d relative to recoveries in recent history. \u201cThis report shows that, as the Biden administration policies have driven a historic economic recovery, we\u2019ve also been building the economy we need for the long term \u2014 one that allows all communities to reach their economic potential,\u201d Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a news release. According to the report, President Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 American Rescue Plan \u201ceffectively delivered resources and aid\u201d to historically underserved communities, which helped the economy recover more quickly than in previous downturns. It\u2019s useful to keep in mind that the report was prepared ahead of an election year in which Biden seeks another term. Even so, it includes plenty of data to support its claims that the nation experienced a \u201chistorically equitable recovery\u201d from the pandemic. The federal government sent out $500 billion in stimulus checks as part of the American Rescue Plan, with eligible individuals getting payments of up to $1,400 per person. That represented the third (and largest) round of stimulus checks after the Trump administration oversaw the first and second stimulus rounds. The American Rescue Plan also expanded the child tax credit , earned income tax credit and child and dependent care tax credit, each of which helped lower the nation\u2019s child poverty rate. In addition, small businesses received emergency grants and minority-owned businesses were eligible for aid through the small business opportunity fund. Jaspreet Singh: America\u2019s Economy Is About To Get a Reality Check, Here\u2019s Why Here are seven key takeaways from the Treasury Department report: From 2019 to 2022, median wealth (adjusted for inflation) for Black, Hispanic and white families rose 60%, 47% and 31%, respectively. These three-year gains were \u201csome of the largest\u201d in the history of the Survey of Consumer Finances and stood \u201cin stark contrast\u201d to the three years following the onset of the Great Recession when real wealth fell for all three groups. Within 20 months after the COVID recession peak, both Black and Hispanic unemployment rates were lower than they were at the same time in previous recoveries and have stayed lower through the most recent data. The employment rate gaps between different ethnic groups have \u201cclosed substantially\u201d\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: How Child Tax Credits and Stimulus Checks Reshaped Economic Fairness\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Over the past few years, Child Tax Credits and Stimulus checks have emerged as powerful tools in reshaping economic fairness and helping families weather financial challenges. These government initiatives have provided crucial support, particularly to low and middle-income households, and have had a far-reaching impact on economic well-being. Child Tax Credits Immediate Relief The expanded Child Tax Credit, which began in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, significantly increased the amount of financial assistance families receive. The credit provided families with up to $3,600 per child under six and up to $3,000 per child aged six to 17, with advance monthly payments to help with immediate expenses. This substantial boost aimed to alleviate child poverty and improve the financial stability of families. As a result, millions of American families saw an increase in their disposable income. Stimulus checks, often referred to as Economic Impact Payments, were another instrumental component of the government\u2019s strategy to support individuals and families during economic turbulence, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple rounds of stimulus checks injected billions of dollars into the economy, helping people meet essential needs, pay bills, and avoid financial hardship. Economic Stability and Consumer Spending The combined impact of Child Tax Credits and stimulus checks has been transformative. They provided immediate relief to families struggling with the economic fallout of the pandemic and contributed to greater economic fairness by reducing income inequality. Low and middle-income households benefited most from these programs, as they received substantial financial aid when they needed it most. Additionally, the newfound economic stability brought about by these initiatives has contributed to increased consumer spending, which, in turn, has driven economic growth and supported job retention and creation. Critics argue that the impact of these programs on the federal budget and potential long-term consequences should not be overlooked. However, proponents emphasize that the short-term benefits of these measures far outweigh their costs and that they have effectively enhanced economic fairness by targeting aid to those most in need. In conclusion, the Child Tax Credits and stimulus checks have played a crucial role in reshaping economic fairness by providing much-needed financial support to low and middle-income families. These initiatives not only alleviated immediate financial stress but also contributed to economic stability, demonstrating the profound impact that well-designed government policies can have on fostering fairness and equity in the economy.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Springfield Unveils COVID-19 Stimulus Package to Boost Economic Recovery\ndate: 2023-10-04\nbody: Discover the latest announcement from Mayor Domenic Sarno and the City American Rescue Plan Act team.

The company won orders for 288 new aircraft last month, net of cancellations and conversions. Much of that was from a massive order Air India announced earlier this year. So far this year, Boeing delivered 266 aircraft to customers, shy of the 316 rival Airbus has handed over. Both manufacturers have struggled to increase output fast enough to avoid delays to airline customers eager for more planes during a boom in air travel. Boeing said Tuesday it logged orders for 288 aircraft, net of cancellations and conversions, in June, most of them from the massive order Air India announced earlier this year and firmed up at the Paris Air Show last month. The 470-jet order was split between Boeing and Airbus. Boeing's June tally included nearly 40 787 Dreamliners for new Saudi carrier Riyadh Air, part of a deal announced in March. Boeing's total net orders for the month came in at 305 aircraft after it added some planes to its backlog. The company routinely removes or adds planes to its backlog for reasons including whether a customer is likely to have financing to buy the aircraft. Boeing is scheduled to report second-quarter results on July 26, when it will update investors on its plans to increase production of its 737 Max planes and 787 Dreamliners.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Boeing deliveries dip as the company and supplier struggle with production flaws\ndate: 2023-10-11\nbody: ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) \u2014 Boeing deliveries of new airline jets slumped in the third quarter as the company struggled with production problems that are cutting into its ability to generate cash. Boeing said Tuesday that it delivered 27 planes in September, including 15 of its best-seller, the 737 Max.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Southwest orders additional 108 Boeing 737 Max 7 aircraft\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: Southwest Airlines has added a further 108 aircraft to its Boeing 737 Max 7 orderbook. The low-cost carrier is the launch customer for the Max variant, and now has a total of 302 Max 7 aircraft on order. The 737-7 took its first flight back in 2018, and had been expected to enter service in 2019. But a series of delays including the grounding of all Max aircraft worldwide, and the subsequent Covid-19 pandemic, has led to this being pushed back several times, with a current expected launch date of 2024. The 737-7 has the longest range of the Max family of aircraft at around 3,800 nautical miles, with Southwest set to configure the plane with 150 passengers in an all-economy layout. Southwest is an all-Boeing carrier, and is gradually replacing its 737-700 and 737-800 aircraft with Max fleets \u2013 the airline already operates over 200 737-8 aircraft, and now has more than 500 Max aircraft on order across the 737-7 and 737-8 variants. Last year Southwest unveiled plans to install new-generation USB A and USB C power ports and larger overhead bins on new deliveries of 737 Max aircraft, as part of an ongoing $2 billion investment to \u201ctransform the customer experience\u201d. Southwest to invest in faster wifi, in-seat power and larger overhead bins Commenting on the news Bob Jordan, president and chief executive officer of Southwest Airlines, said: \u201cWe have a long history with Boeing, dating back more than 50 years to the day we commenced service with three Boeing 737 aircraft serving three cities. \u201cThey\u2019re part of our history and part of our future as we continue to recognize the many efficiencies and cost savings of a single fleet.\u201d southwest.com, boeing.com\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Boeing cuts 737 Max delivery forecast as production issues dent third-quarter results\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Boeing said Wednesday it will deliver fewer 737 Max aircraft than it previously expected this year as it works through production flaws detected on the fuselages of some of the bestselling aircraft. The company expects to hand over between 375 and 400 of its workhorse plane this year, down from a previous estimate of 400 to 450, which Boeing\u2019s CFO reaffirmed during a conference last month. It marks a headwind for Boeing and for airline customers eager to receive new, more fuel-efficient jetliners. Boeing maintained its expectations for 2023 free cash flow of $3 billion to $5 billion, despite the production problems. The company\u2019s shares fell 2.5% on Wednesday to $177.73. \u201cI have heard those outside our company wondering if we\u2019ve lost a step. I view it as quite the opposite,\u201d CEO Dave Calhoun said in an employee note Wednesday, as the company reported third-quarter results. \u201cMost importantly, we\u2019ve worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue, no matter the size, so we can get things right for the future.\u201d He said the company now can fix those issues \u201conce and for all.\u201d The 737 problems stem from misdrilled holes in the fuselages, which are produced by Spirit AeroSystems, which replaced its CEO earlier this month. Boeing and Spirit reached a new pricing agreement in October aimed at shoring up the key supplier. Boeing has been working to increase output of new planes to meet demand for a recovery in air travel after the Covid pandemic. Budget carrier Ryanair, for one, recently cut its winter schedule, blaming delivery delays from Boeing. Sales in the manufacturer\u2019s commercial aircraft unit rose 25% to $7.88 billion from the third quarter of 2022, boosted by deliveries of wide-body 787 Dreamliner planes, though lower 737 deliveries and abnormal production costs led to a negative operating margin of 8.6%. Boeing said it plans to ramp up output of the 737 to 38 planes per month by year\u2019s end and said it is transitioning to Dreamliner production of five per month. It reaffirmed its estimate to hand over 70 to 80 Dreamliners this year. Its defense unit was also losing money in part from a $482 million loss on its Air Force One program because of \u201chigher estimated manufacturing cost related to engineering changes and labor instability,\u201d as well as a $315 million loss on a satellite contract. Here\u2019s how the company performed during the period ended Sept. 30, compared with estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Adjusted loss per share: $3.26 vs. $2.96Revenue: $18.10 billion vs. $18.01 billion Boeing\u2019s net loss narrowed to nearly $1.64 billion, or $2.70 a share, for the third quarter compared with the year-earlier period when it had a loss of $3.31 billion, or $5.49 a share. Adjusting for one-time items, mostly related to pension plans, the company lost $3.26 per share, a wider-than-expected adjusted loss. Revenue rose 13% from the same three-month period a year ago to $18.10 billion, slightly ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates. Boeing will hold a call with analysts at 10:30 a.m. ET when executives will face questions about its production pace, demand and how it expects to improve margins in its defense unit.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Boeing revises down 737 Max delivery forecast amid production issues\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: Boeing (NYSE:BA), under the leadership of CEO David Calhoun, has reported a third quarter loss of $1.64 billion due to decreased deliveries of commercial planes, including its best-selling 737 Max, and increased costs for two new Air Force One jets. This announcement came Today, as the company also revised its 737 Max production forecast down from an initial estimate of 400-450 to between 375-400 due to issues with a pressure-sealing section that required inspections and additional work. The aerospace giant has been grappling with quality issues at Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR), including a defect with misdrilled holes on the 737 MAX 8 aircraft. These challenges have led to a drop in Q3 deliveries to just 70 737s and a cash burn of $310 million. Despite these setbacks, Boeing's shares rose about 3% in premarket trading Today. The company remains focused on stabilizing the supply chain and ramping up aircraft production rates to meet their financial goals for the year. Boeing also incurred losses of $482 million on the Air Force contract and $315 million on a satellite contract. Despite these losses and lower 737 deliveries, the company's revenues rose by 13% to $18.10 billion. The loss per share stood at $3.26, slightly more than the $3.18 predicted by analysts. While there was a decrease in 737 deliveries compared to the previous year, Boeing saw an increase in 787 Dreamliner deliveries. The company plans to increase the 737 output to 38 planes per month by year-end and transition to five Dreamliners per month. Despite facing delivery delays and production flaws, Boeing has upheld its free cash flow projection for 2023 at between $3 billion and $5 billion. The company is committed to increasing production to meet post-pandemic air travel demand, even as these delays have forced customers like Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) to adjust their schedules. In Q3 2022, Boeing's commercial aircraft unit sales rose by 25% to $7.88 billion, largely due to deliveries of wide-body 787 Dreamliner planes. However, abnormal production costs and lower 737 deliveries led to an 8.6% negative operating margin. Despite the challenges, analysts remain optimistic about Boeing's future due to robust order books, including IndiGo's order of 500 Airbus aircraft and Akasa Air's order for four Boeing 737 Max jets.

The car also hit a residence, police said. The car was seriously damaged, and the driver was reported. The driver, a woman, was pronounced dead. She was the only one in the car, police said.

It\u2019s so hard. It\u2019s every parent\u2019s worst nightmare,\" said Tracy Rolston, the mother of 20-year-old Niamh, as she choked back tears. \"You have a kid, and you just hope that nothing like this ever happens.\" Bohm, who is charged with four counts each of murder and vehicular manslaughter, was released Friday on a $4 million bond after spending three days in jail.

While they weren't friends, they've likely crossed paths, she added. Tracy last saw her daughter the weekend before her death. Niamh returned to the family's Los Angeles home to celebrate her mother's birthday. They went shopping on Sunday, and Tracy dropped her off Monday at her dorm room, where she shared a suite with Stewart and Weir, both 21. 4 PEPPERDINE STUDENTS KILLED IN MALIBU COLLISION BY SPEEDING BMW DRIVER: OFFICIALS The foursome, who were all members of the Alpha Phi sorority , headed to a party at the Sigma Chi house at about 8:30 p.m. on Oct. 17 and parked a few houses away. \"He sped so hard that he launched a car into them, and they died from blunt force trauma,\" Tracy said. She and Niamh's father, David Rolston, heard about the crash Wednesday morning and rushed to the scene. \"I drove there hoping that it wasn\u2019t true, but her phone said she was there,\" Tracy recalled, breaking down in sobs. \"She was a happy girl. She loved life. She had everything going for her. They all did, and their lives were cut short.\" The loss has been devastating for Niamh's little brother. LOS ANGELES MODEL FOUND DEAD IN HER REFRIGERATOR WITH WRISTS, ANKLES BOUND: POLICE Weir, of Skippack, Pennsylvania, was an English major while Williams, 21, of Atlanta, was a pre-med biology major. Stewart, of Westwood, New Jersey, studied international business and planned to pursue a career in tech. The Rolston family had a funeral Saturday at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, where Niamh was baptized. Tracy's grief has been compounded by hearing Bohm's high-powered attorney, Michael Kraut, frame his client as a victim. Kraut said last week in Los Angeles Superior Court that Bohm was texting at a stop sign when another driver started yelling at him and then ran him off the road, setting in motion the tragic collision. CHICAGO PROFESSOR APOLOGIZES FOR CALLING ISRAELIS \u2018PIGS\u2019 AND \u2018SAVAGES\u2019 The attorney also insisted that Bohm was only going 70 mph. The posted speed limit is 45 mph. He told Fox News Digital that he'd repeatedly tried to share this information with investigators but that they weren't interested. The attorney said his client wasn't under the influence and had no previous traffic violations. But prosecutor Nathan Bartos said that Bohm, who grew up in an $8.7 million Malibu home with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean, knew the neighborhood well and the dangers of that stretch of highway dubbed \"Dead Man's Curve.\" In an initial interview with detectives, Bohm allegedly admitted that he might have been texting when he crashed and didn't mention that an irate driver had pursued him. CALIFORNIA 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL TOTALS PARENTS' TESLA IN SANTA ROSA CRASH: POLICE \"It was very, very hard to hear his attorney say that he was a victim,\" Tracy told Fox News Digital. \"Our girls are gone, and he was driving 104 mph and possibly texting. I mean, I do realize he didn\u2019t set out to murder them, but at the same time, you can't do what he did.\" The most treacherous section of the Pacific Coast Highway , which includes Dead Man's Curve, inspired the documentary \"21 Miles in Malibu.\" Film producer Michel Shane lost his 13-year-old daughter, Emily, in a car accident on the iconic highway. As for the Rolstons, they're not sure that they will ever heal. \"We\u2019re not over this, and we never will be. It\u2019s very unnatural to bury your child,\" Tracy said.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: One person killed in Colorado Springs car accident, thrown out of vehicle\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: On Saturday night, a fatal accident occurred in Colorado Springs, where one individual was thrown out of the car and lost their life. At approximately 11 p.m., an incident occurred on North Academy Boulevard. According to the authorities, the driver of an SUV was heading down Academy and attempted to make a left turn when they crashed into another car that was traveling towards the south. Sadly, the individual riding in the SUV was thrown from the vehicle and lost their life at the location of the accident. After the accident, the other individuals involved, including passengers and drivers, were transported to the hospital with minor injuries.

According to documents obtained by PEOPLE, the That 70's Show actor, 47, gave his estranged wife Bijou Phillips , 43, full legal and physical custody of their daughter Fianna, 9, with Masterson requesting visitation rights. When she filed for divorce from Masterson in September, Phillips requested legal and physical custody of their daughter, asking that she receive spousal support and to \"terminate the court's ability to grant support\" to Masterson. Her request for divorce came after Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison in his rape retrial in September.

However, a source claimed the That '70s Show actor \"continues to believe he is fully innocent\" more than one month after the 47-year-old was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for raping two women back in 2003. \"But he also realizes that reality is seeping in, and he will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. It is an agonizing ordeal for everyone . But this is their new reality,\" the insider noted to a news publication. The convicted rapist's life was turned upside down ever since he was taken into custody on May 31, shortly after a judge read his verdict declaring he was guilty of two counts of rape by force or fear for the actions he committed 20 years prior. In September, his estranged wife, Bijou Phillips , filed for divorce less than two weeks after his sentence was declared in court . Masterson recently handed over full custody of his and Phillips' 9-year-old daughter, Fianna , though he requested visitation under prison officials' supervision if granted, as OK! previously reported. Phillips' divorce filing came as a surprise since she stood by Masterson's side throughout the entirety of his trials and sentencing. \"When it comes to Danny and Bijou's divorce, everything is being done for the overall benefit of their daughter,\" the source explained of the separated spouses, who tied the knot in 2011 after meeting at a poker tournament prior to the start of their relationship in 2005.

He has been classified as a \"suppressive person\" (SP) by the church, defined as someone whose actions impede spiritual progress, Daily Mail reports. Scientologists who associate with him, including his family and wife, Bijou Phillips , will have to end all communication with the convicted rapist. Insiders told the outlet that the church maintains Masterson is innocent despite the expulsion. Longtime private investigator Jeffrey Augustine revealed the development on his website, The Scientology Money Project , established in 2014 to expose the alleged misdeeds of the church. Former Scientologist Augustine explained to Daily Mail why the organization decided to sever ties with a member they publicly backed in two criminal trials he was involved in. According to Augustine, 66, the Church of Scientology did not intend to go public with the news, and they are still reassuring members that Masterson is innocent and that former Scientologist Leah Remini was a part of the conspiracy to discredit him with other disgruntled former members. \"According to my sources, Danny has been declared a suppressive person, which means he would be expelled from Scientology,\" Augustine said. \"They are telling Scientologists that he will file an appeal and that he is innocent of the charges for which he was convicted. They (church officials) declared Danny a suppressive person for not maintaining the high ethical standards for the Church of Scientology, and other reasons - but not because he was convicted of rape,\" Augustine added. A jury convicted Masterson, 47, of two counts of rape in May. In September, he was sentenced to prison. A third rape case ended with a hung jury, while an earlier trial resulted in a deadlock. In Augustine's view, the church's controversial leader, David Miscavige, has to save face by putting Masterson behind them.\"Miscavige has the International Association of Scientologists event coming up in London. It's the first post-pandemic big multimillion-dollar fundraiser. \"I think Miscavige is clearing the decks ahead of the IAS in London, so he's not asked about Masterson. In other words, he wants it handled. He doesn't want Danny Masterson to be the focus. They are not going to make a public announcement.

The 47-year-old actor responded to Phillips\u2019 filing and agreed to give her physical and legal custody of their 9-year-old daughter, Fianna, according to documents obtained by TMZ. Masterson requested visitation with his daughter be granted, which would have to happen under the supervision of prison officials. Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison in September after the actor was found guilty of two counts of rape in May. Phillips was present at the sentencing and reportedly cried as her now-estranged husband was led out of the courtroom. Days after the September 7 hearing, the Almost Famous actress filed for divorce after nearly 12 years of marriage to Masterson. \"Ms. Phillips has decided to file for divorce from her husband during this unfortunate time,\u201d Phillips\u2019 attorney Peter A. Lauzon told TMZ. \u201cHer priority remains with her daughter.\" He continued, \"This period has been unimaginably hard on the marriage and the family. Mr. Masterson was always present for Ms. Phillips during her most difficult times of her life. Ms. Phillips acknowledges that Mr. Masterson is a wonderful father to their daughter.\" Phillips started dating Masterson in 2004 and the couple tied the knot in 2011. They welcomed their daughter in 2014. Prior to Masterson's sentencing, Phillips wrote a letter to the judge, calling her husband an \u201camazing father\u201d and adding, \u201cOur daughter and I are heartbroken that he is not home with us.\u201d \u201cI can say that Danny has literally been a life-saving partner to me,\u201d she wrote. Masterson was charged in 2020 with raping three women he met through the Church of Scientology between 2001 and 2003. The jury failed to reach a verdict on the third rape charge involving the actor\u2019s alleged longtime girlfriend The incidents occurred at the height of Masterson\u2019s stardom, while playing Steven Hyde on That \u201870s Show. His most famous co-stars on the show, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, were among many who wrote character letters in support of Masterson to the judge during his trial. Kunis\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: What is Danny Masterson\u2019s net worth in 2023?\ndate: 2023-09-13\nbody: Long before he was a convicted rapist, Danny Masterson was one of the most-liked characters on That \u201970s Show. While he never reached the heights of his co-stars, Masterson persisted \u2014 through countless rewatches \u2014 as a common pick for \u201cbest character\u201d in the late \u201990s period piece. His character, Hyde, is witty, straightforward, and deeply anti-establishment \u2014 all traits that speak to modern audiences, and Masterson\u2019s delivery earned him heaps of praise from fans. That is, until his history of sexual assault came to light, and Masterson landed among Hollywood\u2019s most notorious. He\u2019ll likely spend most, if not all, of the remainder of his life in prison, and most of his former fans are wishing the star a not-so-fond farewell. Even as he ruminates in prison for the next 25 to 30 years, Masterson\u2019s got a heftier bank account than many of us will ever lay eyes on. Years of relatively consistent work, from That \u201970s Show to The Ranch, earned Masterson plenty of cash, but he won\u2019t have much opportunity to spend it in prison. Danny Masterson\u2019s net worth Almost every member of the That \u201970s Show cast made it big following their tenure on the show, with even Josh Meyers (from the heavily criticized final season) finding plenty of work in the wake of his appearance. Masterson never boasted the name recognition of Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, or even Wilmer Valderrama, but he never truly left the spotlight behind. After That \u201970s Show, Masterson went on to enjoy a variety of roles in similarly-themed films (Puff, Puff, Pass, Smiley Face) and several lengthy stints on popular shows like Men at Work and The Ranch. Several decades of consistent work earned Masterson a net worth of $8 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He likely earned a minor income as a DJ as well, but it was his work on the big and small screen that really earned Masterson his fortune. That fortune won\u2019t do him much good now, of course \u2014 as he eyes a lengthy prison sentence \u2014 but it should serve his wife, Bijou Phillips, along with their daughter, well.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:34AM\nGiven a question from a America user: National immigration policy changes\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Maine leaders closely follow changes to national immigration policy\ndate: 2023-05-09\nbody: PORTLAND (WGME) \u2013 Maine leaders are watching closely as an immigration policy used to turn away millions during the pandemic is about to expire. The end of Title 42 is expected to result in a surge of migrants at the southern border. Title 42 will go away right before midnight on Thursday evening. After that, projections suggest that Homeland Security encounters could increase up to 13,000 migrants a day. Many migrants will be seeking asylum, and it comes at a time in which Maine is already dealing with an asylum-seeker crisis. Title 42 expires right as communities like Sanford are dealing with a sudden and unexpected influx of about 100 asylum seekers just in the last few days. The city manager says he's concerned about Title 42 ending. Starting Friday, the U.S. will go back to its previous policy, Title 8. \u201cWe have been preparing for this transition for more than a year and a half,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. The Biden administration says there will be new pathways for people to legally enter the U.S. while the administration cracks down on illegal crossings. \u201cIt carries stiff consequences for irregular migration, including at least a five-year ban on reentry and potential criminal prosecution for repeated attempts to cross unlawfully,\u201d Mayorkas said. It would make those people ineligible for asylum. In a statement, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, which is based in Maine, says Title 42 stripped asylum seekers of their legal and human rights. And the Biden Administration's plans to put in a new policy will continue to deny access to asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, disproportionally impacting Black and Brown immigrants, and \"leave people trapped in dangerous situations.\" ILAP calls for building a just, accessible, and welcoming asylum system and support structure from the Southern border to communities across the country, including here in Maine. Everyone deserves a safe place to live and thrive. Resource challenges that we are facing in Maine and beyond should be met with resource solutions, not denying access to life-saving humanitarian protection. We can and must welcome people with dignity. When we do so, we strengthen our communities for everyone.\" National leaders are concerned that smugglers are claiming the border will soon be open, leading to a surge in people trying to get in. Martha Stein is the executive director for Hope Acts, an organization that helps asylum seekers and immigrants. She says it\u2019s unclear what to expect. \u201cWe know that the city of Portland and surrounding communities are struggling to help so many people,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAnd this is playing out all over the country.\u201d In Portland, more than 1,000 asylum seekers arrived in just the first few months of the year. The city's communication director, Jessica Grondin, says they're aware of Title 42 expiring, however, \"There's not much it changes for us since we've already said on previous occasions that we are already at capacity.\" She also says they've been clear with those at the border about the current situation. Stein hopes everyone from the federal level down can get on the same page. \u201cMy hope would be that we could stop weaponizing, demonizing, politicizing and come to a solution that would really serve everyone,\u201d Stein said.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Analysis of Emp & Family Changes in the Dec 2023 FY24 Visa Bulletin and Biden's Immigration Policy Shift\ndate: 2023-10-10\nbody: Dive into the latest updates on US Immigration with the November 2023 Visa Bulletin, freshly released by the State Department.

This is what asylum seeker Juan \u00c1ngel Hern\u00e1ndez Castillo said he lived through at Torrance County Detention Center in Estancia, New Mexico. And despite a recent national Immigrations and Customs Enforcement policy change spurred by another asylum seeker detained in New Mexico, Hern\u00e1ndez Castillo isn\u2019t hopeful that the federal agency will change overall. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lie that they will treat people better,\u201d he said. Discrimination against asylum seeker with disability in NM leads to national policy change It\u2019s unclear if the new rules, which can affect how federal officers restrain people who have disabilities, have been enacted at New Mexico detention centers already. CoreCivic is the company that owns and operates two of three detention centers in New Mexico, including in Torrance County, where federal immigration officials held Hern\u00e1ndez Castillo, and in Cibola County, where they held the asylum seeker that caused the national policy change. Brian Todd, spokesperson for CoreCivic, didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry from Source NM if the updated policy has already been enacted at their facilities. He did say \u201cCoreCivic employees comply fully with all ICE policies\u201d at the Cibola and Torrance county facilities.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn\u2019t respond to several inquiries from Source NM for comment. An injury at a facility with past condition concerns Hern\u00e1ndez Castillo is seeking safety in the U.S. from death threats that came in Honduras after he testified against someone who ran a VISA scam.

He said the conditions living in the facility were horrible. \u201cI would not wish my experience there on anyone else,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez Castillo said.

American immigration policy is enforced by a sprawling bureaucracy rebuilt in the aftermath of 9/11 from the bones of a 20th-century system designed to modulate the flow of temporary workers from Mexico. The resulting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hosts three major immigration agencies with a workforce weary of radical policy changes from administration to administration. Since their creation in 2003, the DHS agencies of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have faced partisan culture shock: the terrorism prevention focus of the Bush administration and the overtly restrictionist policies of Trump, alternating with the more liberal strategies of the Obama and Biden administrations. \u201cIn some ways, the bigger fact here that is really difficult for these agencies is whiplash. And it is the fact that with each administration, there have been really sharp changes in policy, and that is very difficult for large organizations of any kind,\u201d said Doris Meissner, who ran the Immigration and Naturalization Service under former President Clinton and now heads the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cBut certainly, these organizations that are dealing with such controversial issues, those really sharp changes from administration to administration are probably the more difficult thing to live with.\u201d Those changes have been so abrupt as to affect the agencies\u2019 entire mission statements. In 2018, under President Trump, then-USCIS Director Francis Cissna announced a new such statement, dropping the phrase \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d and removing the term \u201ccustomers\u201d for the foreign nationals who petition the agency for work permits, changes in immigration status and naturalizations. Last year, the Biden administration quietly introduced a new, brief mission statement, dropping Cissna\u2019s national security-focused motto without returning to the original, wordy language: \u201cUSCIS upholds America\u2019s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility with fairness, integrity, and respect for all we serve.\u201d The whiplash is more than skin-deep, and it affects leadership at all levels. ICE hasn\u2019t had a Senate-confirmed director since the Obama administration, and CBP has been led by an acting commissioner for four of the last six years. \u201cIt\u2019s affected the bigger vision piece,\u201d said an official who asked for anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cBut the underlying function has been moving toward professionalization.\u201d Trump, for one, weaponized the difficulty of Senate confirmations, spending nearly half his presidency with an acting DHS secretary. \u201cI like acting.

These changes focus on protecting immigrant health and welfare, reversing previous measures that deterred many immigrants from accepting necessary health, nutrition, and housing assistance, according to the Illinois Attorney General's Office. \"Public charge\" refers traditionally to individuals primarily reliant on public cash assistance for income or institutional long-term care. By the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, such individuals often cannot gain admission to the U.S. or secure permanent residency. In December 2022, the Biden administration codified this guidance, reversing previous measures that expanded the public charge category to include short-term recipients of certain federal aids. The coalition contends that these changes are within legal parameters and that it would benefit their respective states' residents, including immigrants, by encouraging enrollment in health and nutrition programs. Perceived advantages include the promotion of health and well-being, improved immunization rates, enhanced student health and performance, and reduced strain on state agencies and public health systems. However, these policy adjustments are meeting resistance. The Southern District of Texas, for instance, has lodged a lawsuit to reverse the revised regulations and reinstate the former administration's broader 2019 definition of a public charge, furthers the Illinois Attorney General's Office. Despite ongoing legal obstacles, the coalition maintains its support for the changes.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Workers can start Social Security at age 62 but doing so results in a substantial and permanent benefit reduction. Workers born in 1960 or later can increase their retirement benefit 77% by claiming Social Security at age 70 rather than age 62.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More As of Sept. 2023, nearly 50 million retired workers receive a monthly Social Security check, and most consider these benefits an indispensable source of income. Indeed, the program keeps over 15 million seniors out of poverty, making it the most successful anti-poverty program in U.S. history. But individual payouts vary widely and it's important to understand why. Read on to see the average retired-worker benefit at age 62, how it compares to the average payout at other ages, and how claiming age impacts the Social Security benefits formula. The average retired-worker benefit at age 62 The Social Security Administration publishes a detailed breakdown of current benefit payments twice each year. The latest report indicates the average Social Security benefit for 62-year-old retired workers was $1,277 per month in June 2023. But that figure means very little without additional context. The chart below offers a basis for comparison. It details the average Social Security benefit for retired workers aged 62 to 70 in June 2023. The chart calls attention to a very important trend. The average retired-worker benefit was smallest at age 62 and largest at age 70, and the difference between the two payments is substantial. That difference is the result of differences between individuals across three variables -- work history, lifetime earnings, and claiming age -- that impact the Social Security benefits formula. Retirees and current workers should have a basic understanding of that equation. How Social Security retired-worker benefits are determined Calculating Social Security retirement benefits requires two easy to understand steps. The first involves calculating the primary insurance amount (PIA), and the second involves applying any reductions or credits based on claiming age, as detailed below: Step 1: Income from the 35 highest-paid years of work is adjusted for wage inflation and converted to a monthly average, which is known as the average indexed\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Can You Claim Your Personal Social Security Benefit as Well as a Spousal Benefit?\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: You may be entitled to Social Security based on your own earnings record as well as a spousal benefit. While you can file for your own benefits and switch to a spousal benefit later on, you can't collect both simultaneously.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More If you're married, you have a few different ways to collect benefits from Social Security. If you worked and are entitled to a monthly benefit of your own, you can claim it based on your wage history. And if you're married to (or divorced from) from someone who's eligible for Social Security, you can collect a spousal benefit once they file for benefits of their own. (If you're divorced, you may be able to get spousal benefits before your ex files.) You may be wondering if you're allowed to collect both your own personal Social Security benefit as well as a spousal benefit. And the answer is yes, you can. But you can't double dip and collect both benefits at the same time. When your spousal benefit is the more generous payday If you're eligible for a monthly Social Security benefit based on your personal earnings history, the only reason to want a spousal benefit off the bat is if it's higher than the monthly benefit you're eligible for on your own. So, let's say that based on your wage history, you're entitled to a monthly Social Security benefit of $1,400. If your spouse is eligible for $3,000, you can collect $1,500 provided you wait until your full retirement age to start receiving Social Security. So in this case, it makes sense that you'd want a spousal benefit, since it's more money. However, if you're still married, you have to wait until your spouse files for Social Security to claim a spousal benefit. And if you're older and are retiring first, you may not want to wait. In that case, you are allowed to claim monthly benefits on your own record and then upgrade to a spousal benefit once your spouse starts collecting Social Security. But in that situation, Social Security will simply bump you up to your higher benefit amount each month. You won't collect two sets of benefits. So for example, let's say your full retirement age is 67 and your spouse hasn't yet claimed Social Security\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Will Social Security be there for me when I retire? Here's how the agency's chief actuary answers that common question\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Many Americans fear Social Security benefits won't be there for them when they retire, yet those worries are largely unfounded. \"It's a long way from not having any money to pay for any benefits,\" Stephen Goss, Social Security's chief actuary, said last week of the program's funds. Here's what may happen in the worst-case scenario, and how you can find out how much you could be eligible for in retirement. When it comes to Social Security, many people have one question: \"Will my benefits be there when I retire?\" Fears that the program could run out of money tempt some people to claim benefits as early as possible to get back the funds they have paid into the program for their retirement. Meanwhile, beneficiaries who are already receiving monthly checks may worry that their income will come to a stop. In a new interview released by the agency last week, Social Security Administration Chief Actuary Stephen Goss sought to reassure people with regard to those doubts. More from Personal Finance: \"It's a long way from not having any money to pay for any benefits,\" Goss said of the program's funding. \"So, people should not worry about the trust fund running out of money, as is sometimes said, and having an inability to pay any benefits,\" he said. What may happen in the worst-case scenario Yet it is possible benefits may be reduced. In the worst-case scenario, Social Security may reach a point within 10 years where the program may only be able to pay about 80% of scheduled benefits, Goss said. Today, Social Security has two trust funds that have a total of $2.8 trillion in reserves and function like savings accounts for the program, according to Goss. The trust funds collect any extra money that comes into the program. When more money is needed to pay benefits beyond what is coming in through payroll taxes, the trusts funds are available. But projections show the $2.8 trillion reserves will be used up around 2033 or 2034, Goss said. At that point, the income coming into the program will be less than what is required to pay benefits under current law. Social Security's actuaries are responsible for estimating the future costs of benefits that must be paid and comparing that with the amount of revenue projected to come in, according to Goss. When there is an imbalance, as with the current projected shortfall, it is up to Congress to make changes. Some lawmakers have started to propose potential ways of approaching the problem. Both Republicans and Democrats will have to approve any changes for them to become law.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Social Security increase: Here\u2019s the COLA increase for 2024\ndate: 2023-10-28\nbody: STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The roughly 70 million Americans who receive Social Security benefits will see a smaller bump in their monthly checks in the coming year than they\u2019ve grown accustomed to. Each year, Social Security benefits are subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) based on inflation rates to ensure that monthly payments keep pace with rising costs. Earlier this month, the Social Security Administration (SSA) announced that beneficiaries will see a 3.2% increase starting January 2024, raising the average monthly payment by more than $50. The SSA will begin notifying recipients of their new monthly benefit amount by mail in early December. Cost-of-living adjustments are determined using third-quarter data \u2013 July, August and September \u2013 from the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Inflation for those three months is added together, averaged and then compared to the previous year\u2019s third-quarter average, with the percentage difference between the current year and the previous year serving as the COLA rate for the upcoming year. In recent years, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\u2019s impact on inflation led to abnormally high adjustments, including a 5.9% increase in 2022 and an 8.7% increase in 2023, which was the largest increase in four decades. Reductions in inflation over the past year brought 2024\u2032s adjustment back down to 3.2%, which is more in line with the 2.6% average annual increase seen over the past two decades. In 2023, an average of nearly 67 million Americans per month collect Social Security benefits, totaling over $1.4 trillion dollars in benefits paid during the year, according to the SSA. Social Security benefits represent about 30% of income for Americans aged 65 and older, the administration said.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: 13 Critical Facts About Social Security Spousal Benefits That You Need To Know\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: We receive compensation from the products and services mentioned in this story, but the opinions are the author's own.

Receiving spousal benefits doesn\u2019t reduce your spouse\u2019s retirement income First of all, it\u2019s crucial to know that applying to receive a Social Security spousal benefit doesn\u2019t take money out of one individual\u2019s pocket and put it into another\u2019s. Instead, your spouse receives the amount they\u2019re entitled to, and you receive up to 50% of that amount as a spousal benefit. Put another way, you don\u2019t need to worry about harming your financial future by taking a spousal benefit.

Drugs, Oct. 27, Raymond Street, CCSO Undersheriff Quentin Reynolds said staff at Volunteers of America conducted a bag search at 9:21 p.m. for an individual upon his return to the VOA for the night. The suspect is a current VOA resident as well as a federal inmate for distributing a controlled substance while possessing a firearm. VOA found two small film canisters with orange backer and rectangular film marked \u201cA8.\u201d Via Drugs.com, staff identified the substance as a schedule III narcotic. Deputies arrested the man for taking controlled substances into the VOA as well as unlawful possession. He is to be held for court. Tobacco violation, Oct. 29, Lakeway Road and Butler Spaeth Road, CCSO Reynolds said deputies at 1:48 p.m. stopped a gray 2007 Subaru that was traveling 48 mph in a 35 mph zone near Lakeway Road and Butler Spaeth Road. Deputies saw a vape pen in the 18-year-old man\u2019s lap. A search of the vehicle found a total of two vape pens. The deputies issued the man a citation for minor in possession of tobacco.

The FBI released its annual national crime data this month, which analyzed 2022\u2019s crime trends, and found violent incidents decreased by 1.7% last year when compared to 2021. Violent crimes are defined as incidents such as rape, robberies, armed assault and homicide. Murders and non-negligent manslaughter, specifically, dropped 6.1% last year, while rape incidents decreased by 5.4%. The national violent crime stats for 2022 are only a fraction of a percent higher than 2019 data, showing a return to pre-pandemic crime levels. FBI'S NATIONAL CRIME DATA FOR 2021 INCOMPLETE, LACKS DATA FROM NEARLY 40% OF POLICE NATIONWIDE For California and Florida, however , the violent crime stats wildly differ from both each other and national trends, which Stimson attributed to state policies and leaders.

While juvenile crime on the whole in Maryland is below pre-pandemic levels, the numbers for particular offenses are \u201coff the charts,\u201d according to Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney John McCarthy. Montgomery County Council members on the Public Safety Committee were briefed on the issue Monday. According to information provided to them, juvenile carjackings in the state jumped by 85% and handgun violations were up 220% between 2021 and 2023. Last week, a high school student was found with a firearm at Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda. On the same day, students at Fairland Elementary School found a gun in a trash can on campus. Also last week, a 12-year-old was found responsible for seven bomb threats directed at Montgomery County schools. A 15-year-old was found responsible for a bomb threat directed at Paint Branch High School on Thursday. \u201cThousands of people were impacted by the conduct of two people,\u201d Council member Dawn Luedtke said during the Monday committee meeting. Luedtke added there doesn\u2019t appear to be an adequate program to address the kind of offenses committed. Police said the 15-year-old was charged with making threats of mass violence. The 12-year-old could not be charged under Maryland state law due to their age. Luedtke said measures are needed \u201cto help that child understand what they did, and to help their parents understand what they did.\u201d Luedtke said she doesn\u2019t see that happening. \u201cThe juvenile justice system is broken. It is broken because there are not programs for kids,\u201d State\u2019s Attorney McCarthy said.

That case attracted national attention because of the anti-white bias that the court found underpinned the incident on West Maui almost a decade ago. Without revisiting the specifics of that case, reports of crime motivated by anti-white bias are relatively rare according to the 2022 Crime in the Nation Statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Nationally, only 8% of hate crimes involved racial bias towards white victims compared to 29% against people of color, the FBI\u02bbs 2022 report found. Those same numbers would have us believe that the dynamic flips in the Aloha State to 41% of hate crimes being motivated by anti-white bias, with anti-Black bias the next highest at 19% in 2022. But, let\u02bbs just stop right there for a moment because here is where we proceed with caution. It turns out that our understanding of offenses in Hawaii, including hate crimes, has been incomplete and that\u02bbs hampered our ability to make meaningful national comparisons. Happily that appears about to change, and here is why. Up until 2021, the FBI had been primarily collating crime statistics for its Uniform Crime Reporting program using a system that had effectively been the same since the 1930s. In January 2021 the FBI implemented a new standard for reporting crimes to the UCR program called the National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS. NIBRS is far more comprehensive, the FBI says, identifying \"when and where crime takes place, what form it takes, and the characteristics of its victims and perpetrators.\" The change initially created a major pothole in the crimes reported to the bureau in 2021 as many departments had not made the shift. The transition to the NIBRS system is a significant challenge for local departments and requires among other things, a half-million-dollar computer setup. Only around 60% of agencies nationwide were able to report under the old system or NIBRS that year, the policy analysis website Stateline found. There were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 limits to participation in the Uniform Crime Reporting program with only some states requiring their departments to submit data. The DOJ found that the 2022 NIBRS data represented around 73% of the\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Vandalized Smitten Ice Cream Store Shuts Down\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: A Smitten Ice Cream store in San Francisco\u2019s Valencia Street has been forced to close after an act of vandalism. The store\u2019s windows were shattered and a message was spray-painted on the exterior. The closure announcement was shared on social media, leaving fans uncertain about whether it will be temporary or permanent. Smitten Ice Cream, known for its unique treats made with liquid nitrogen, has been a beloved part of the San Francisco community since it first opened in 2009. Closure of Smitten Ice Cream Store The Smitten Ice Cream store on Valencia Street in San Francisco recently closed due to an act of vandalism. Unknown individuals smashed some of the store\u2019s windows and spray-painted a misspelled phrase on one of them. Mission Local reported the incident, which happened shortly before the store announced its closure on Instagram. It is unclear whether the closure is temporary or permanent, as Smitten owner Robyn Sue Fisher has not provided any comments. The closure has had a significant impact on the local community, as the store was a popular destination for both residents and visitors who enjoyed Smitten\u2019s unique ice cream, made in small batches using liquid nitrogen. It remains uncertain what the future holds for Smitten Ice Cream in light of this unfortunate incident. Vandalism Incident and Damage In a recent act of vandalism, the Smitten Ice Cream store on Valencia Street in San Francisco fell victim to spray-painting. One of the store\u2019s windows was defaced with the misspelled phrase \u2018FREE PALESTIEN\u2019. This incident occurred shortly before the store announced its closure. Vandals also smashed some of the storefront windows, prompting the use of plywood to cover the exterior. The consequences of this vandalism have been significant for the small business, leading to the store\u2019s closure. Such acts of vandalism can have detrimental effects on small businesses, including financial losses, property damage, and a sense of insecurity for both owners and customers. To prevent and address incidents like this, it is important for businesses to implement security measures such as surveillance cameras, alarms, and strong locks. Additionally, community engagement and cooperation with local law enforcement can help deter such incidents and hold the perpetrators accountable.

As the numbers from their 24-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings show, Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs just aren\u2019t getting it done. The two wideouts combined for a paltry 51 yards on a whopping 17 total targets \u2014 that\u2019s exactly three yards per target \u2014 as they struggled to make any of a series of contested catches, a sign that they\u2019re not getting open. Enter Dontayvion Wicks, the 5th-round rookie receiver who seems to be open consistently. Wicks looks like a player who, based on his tape, deserves more looks. But Wicks continues to be limited to playing a third of the team\u2019s offensive plays or less, while the second-year receivers soak up a massive number of snaps. It\u2019s frustrating to see the players who are playing well (or at least better than their peers) not being rewarded with more playing time. Will that trend change? Here\u2019s a look at all of the playing time numbers from Sunday\u2019s loss. OFFENSE (68 total snaps) Quarterback Jordan Love 68 Love threw an interception in his fifth straight game on Sunday, though that pass was ripped away from a receiver and was not entirely his fault. Still, he completed less than 60% of his passes for the fifth time in seven games and posted his lowest net yards per attempt in any game this season (4.36). His accuracy still leaves something to be desired, but his stat line was hurt significantly by drops, as the Packers were charted with six or more, depending on your strictness as a grader. Love did add another 34 yards on four rushing attempts, but many of those yards came on third-and-long scrambles with no receivers open. Running Backs AJ Dillon 35, Aaron Jones 35 The Packers continued to gradually ramp up Jones\u2019 playing time, as he crept up to about 50 percent of the offensive snaps. He and Dillon also split carries and pass targets about equally; each had five targets while Jones carried the ball 7 times to Dillon\u2019s 6. But neither player was much of a factor with the offense entirely unable to get moving in the first half. Wide Receivers Romeo Doubs 56, Christian Watson 56, Jayden Reed 53, Dontayvion Wicks 23, Samori Tour\u00e9 4 The Packers were in 11 personnel on something like 80 percent of their offensive snaps in this game,\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Eagles snap count analysis: Week 8 at Commanders\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: In their Week 8 win over the Washington Commanders, the Philadelphia Eagles played 63 snaps on offense and 72 on defense. Let's just get right to the snap counts, and some notes. Quarterback \u2022 63 snaps: Jalen Hurts Analysis: Hurts had by far his best statistical performance of the season (29 of 38 for 319 yards, 4 TDs, 0 INTs) while dealing with a bone bruise on his knee. He only rushed 4 times for 6 yards, and most of his damage was done from inside pocket. The Eagles have a huge game next Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys, and then Hurts will be able to get some rest on the bye week. Running back \u2022 44 snaps: D'Andre Swift \u2022 19 snaps: Kenny Gainwell \u2022 1 snap: Boston Scott Analysis: During the 2022 season, Swift came out hot in September, and then cooled off a bit in October due to an injury. That same pattern has held true in 2023, minus the injury: D'Andre Swift Rushes Yards YPC TD Patriots 1 3 3.0 0 Vikings 28 175 6.2 1 Buccaneers 16 130 8.1 0 Commanders 14 56 4.0 1 Rams 17 70 4.1 0 Jets 10 18 1.8 0 Dolphins 15 62 4.1 0 Commanders 16 57 3.6 1 The Eagles' rushing attack as a whole has cooled off in October, really. The return of Cam Jurgens could help. Aside from Week 2 against the Vikings when he didn't play at all due to injury, Gainwell had his lowest snap count of the season. The previous low was last week against the Dolphins, when he played 23 snaps. Based on the snap count numbers, his role seems to be shrinking a bit, despite Nick Sirianni's insistence that the team hasn't lost any faith in him. Scott played his lone snap during the Eagles' first drive of the game. Wide receiver \u2022 62 snaps: A.J. Brown \u2022 61 snaps: DeVonta Smith \u2022 30 snaps: Olamide Zaccheaus \u2022 15 snaps: Julio Jones Analysis: We covered Brown, Smith, and Jones at length in our \"10 awards,\" so we won't rehash all of that here.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Spike in Jets-Giants didn\u2019t violate NFL\u2019s current snap mechanics\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: After a play that got the Jets to the Giants\u2019 17 with the clock ticking under 10 seconds, everyone hustled to the line. That included umpire Bryan Neale. Neale swooped in, slipping between the left guard and left tackle and touching the ball before it was snapped. Neale didn\u2019t spot the ball; the Jets did. Neale simply touched it, allowing it to be snapped. It looked strange. It seemed off. It appeared that the umpire abandoned his duty to spot the ball, making a perfunctory tap and allowing it to be snapped. Many have complained about the perception that the Jets got a gift. But here\u2019s the reality. That\u2019s the approach, and the league is fine with it. If the football is on the ground and in the correct spot, the official simply has to touch the ball before the snap. That\u2019s what happened here. So what about the concern that the Jets spotted the ball on their own? As one source explained it, the downfield officials are marking the spot on the sideline. During training camp, officials work with clubs and players to remind them of the officials that they use as guides when lining up. In this case, the Jets executed everything to perfection. They lined up in the right place, got the ball in the right spot, waited for the official to touch the ball, and then snapped it and spiked it. (It\u2019s possible that Giants defender Kayvon Thibodeaux was in the neutral zone at the snap; if called, that would have given the Jets a shorter field goal try.) As another source put it, the league is comfortable with this approach because it gives the offense a chance to squeeze out another play, setting the stage for more exciting finishes to games.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: What can we learn from the Giants\u2019 PFF grades and snap counts against the Jets?\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: The New York Giants\u2019 2023 season effectively ended yesterday with a 13-10 overtime loss to the New York Jets that evoked memories of the 2010 DeSean Jackson punt return loss to Philadelphia. The good news is: That Giants team won the Super Bowl the following year. The bad news is: That Giants team had many of the players who won it all in 2007 and still finished the 2010 season 10-6, though they missed the playoffs. This Giants team will only finish with six losses if it runs run the table. The odds of that happening are about as good as the odds of blowing a 10-7 lead with 1:26 left with the ball and a first down on the opponent\u2019s 26 yard line. (So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s possible!?!) What do Pro Football Focus grades and snap counts tell us about why this game played out the way it did? Does anyone care at this point? Let\u2019s take a look anyway, there are at least a couple of points to make. OFFENSE PFF grades If we can take any comfort from the Giants\u2019 offense yesterday, it is that Mark Glowinski had his second consecutive strong game (81.0). After a nightmare opening game vs. Dallas temporarily lost him his starting job, Glowinski has rebounded nicely. Stronger in the run game (79.4) than the pass game (55.7), but that was his reputation in Indianapolis. The rest of the offensive line was either slightly below average (Justin Pugh, 55.8; John Michael Schmitz, 55.5) or flat-out poor (fan favorite Tyre Phillips, 45.0; Ben Bredeson, 43.4). Daniel Bellinger, now the supposed blocking tight end, graded 35.0. Also in the bloom-is-off-the-rose category, fan favorite Tyrod Taylor graded 51.1 before his injury and Don Bosco\u2019s own Tommy DeVito garnered a 46.5. Welcome back, Daniel Jones! One surprise to me was that Saquon Barkley was graded slightly below average (58.2). I realize that he averaged only 3.6 yards per carry, and that he went down too early on the critical first down with 1:26 to play (supposedly because he slipped). But when the opponent knows the ball is going to you on almost every down, you\u2019re running behind an offensive line whose collective run blocking grade yesterday was 48.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: BJ's Offers Grocery Delivery for SNAP Recipients\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: BJ's Wholesale Club and Instacart have announced a partnership that allows SNAP recipients to purchase groceries through the Instacart app and website for delivery in just one hour.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:35AM\nGiven a question from a America user: National climate change legislation\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Here's how Americans feel about climate change\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: Most Americans say that climate change is harming people in the United States, and that climate impacts will get worse over their lifetime, according to a new national survey by the Pew Research Center. Nearly 3 in 4 people said that climate change is hurting people in the U.S. today, according to the survey of nearly 9,000 adults. Indeed, this year has seen a record-breaking number of weather disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage each, including the catastrophic wildfires in Maui, a hurricane in Florida and multiple deadly floods. This is the first time the Pew Research Center, which conducts national surveys on a range of salient topics in American life, has included such detailed questions about how Americans feel about the current and future impacts of climate change. Most of those surveyed say they expect climate-driven disasters to intensify in the future. \"The majority of Americans see some fairly severe environmental harms as likely to happen over the next 30 years,\" says Alec Tyson of the Pew Research Center, who helped lead the survey. \"For example, 73% say they think a growing number of plant and animal species will go extinct, 61% say they think heat waves will cause large numbers of people to die in the U.S. every year and 58% think rising sea levels will force large numbers of people in the U.S. to move away from the coast.\" Those sentiments are backed up by scientific research, which has long warned that greenhouse gas emissions would threaten Americans' health, finances and very lives. Reducing fossil fuel consumption dramatically and immediately will help avoid even more dangerous warming in the future. Most Americans expect renewable energy to get more ubiquitous in the coming years, the survey finds, with 57% saying that they expect renewable energy will produce most of the energy in the U.S. in 30 years. In 2022, renewable energy, including wind and solar, accounted for a little less than a quarter of American electricity generation, but investment in renewable energy is accelerating. People aren't necessarily worried about their own communities One thing the survey suggests is that there is tension between Americans' perception that climate change impacts are getting worse, and their understanding of how those impacts might occur in their own communities. Although most respondents say climate change impacts will be more severe in the next 30 years, only 41% think climate change will make their own community a worse place to live over that same time period. And just as many say they don't think climate change will make much difference in their community. That dissonance also shows up in\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Push made to keep companies climate-conscious with legislation\ndate: 2023-10-06\nbody: Local politicians and climate advocates have joined hands in support of the New York Climate Superfund Act, which currently is making its way through the state legislature. Companies with a history relating to the increase of greenhouse gases would be required to take on a portion of the cost for \u201cinfrastructure investments to adapt to climate change,\u201d according to the bill. The bill would be an important step but would only apply to past pollution from companies, Susan Woods of the Interfaith Climate Justice Community said. \u201cThis assessment fee is on past pollution, not what they're currently doing, it's what they have done. And so, it's not part of the current cost of production. And one really important factor, how much each company pays in the Superfund assessment depends on the extent to which that company\u2019s activity has contributed to past fossil fuel pollution.\u201d The Climate Superfund Act passed the state senate last year. Assemblyman Pat Burke, D-West Seneca, pledged to be among the legislation\u2019s sponsors within the state assembly. Last year\u2019s winter storms demonstrate why the climate act should be a priority, said Lynda Schneekloth from the Western New York Environmental Alliance, especially if there again is the potential danger for necessities, like the city\u2019s water treatment plant, to shut down. \u201cCan you imagine not being able to get water when you turn the tap, not being able to get rid of the waste that's in your house and the toilets, that's what could possibly happen,\u201d she said. \u201cJust imagine if that happened in the wintertime, when it was freezing cold and electricity was sporadic anyway. So, we need absolutely need to take care of this infrastructure.\u201d If the legislation passes, how much \u201chistorical polluters\u201d pay toward the climate change adaptation program would be proportional to how much pollution they contributed, so not every company would pay the same amount. These funds could be used for infrastructure needs ranging from drainage system upgrades to \u201cenergy-efficient cooling systems in public and private buildings,\u201d according to the bill.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Newsom signs climate bills that force large companies to reveal role and risks in climate change\ndate: 2023-10-09\nbody: Gov. Gavin Newsom Saturday signed two closely-watched, first-in-the-nation bills that will force large companies to disclose their greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change and their financial risks. Newsom approved Senate Bill 261, which requires large companies to biennially report their financial risks from climate change. But he saidin a statement Saturday that he will work with the Legislature on relaxing the law\u2019s 2026 implementation date because the California Air Resources Board won\u2019t have \u201csufficient time to adequately carry out the requirements.\u201d He added that he also is \u201cconcerned about the overall financial impact of this bill on businesses, so I am instructing CARB to closely monitor the cost impacts.\u201d \u201cI look forward to working with the Legislature on these outstanding items to ensure that the bill\u2019s intent is achieved,\u201d he said. Under the new law, more than 10,000 companies with revenues exceeding $500 million to detail how climate change threatens the profitability and financial stability of their operations, not just in California, but around the world. Examples are high temperatures, wildfires, droughts and other natural conditions altered by climate change. Newsom also signed Senate Bill 253, but voiced similar concerns about the deadline. Under that groundbreaking bill, beginning in 2026, about 5,300 U.S. corporations earning more than $1 billion and doing business in California must annually report their global emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gases. \u201cThe implementation deadlines in this bill are likely infeasible, and the reporting protocol specified could result in inconsistent reporting across businesses subject to the measure. I am directing my Administration to work with the bill\u2019s author and the Legislature next year to address these issues,\u201d Newsom said. In the final weeks of California\u2019s legislative session, business groups, growers and oil companies intensely lobbied lawmakers to reject the greenhouse gas bill, calling it unworkable and likely to lead to inaccurate reports of emissions. Environmental groups, big tech companies Apple, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce, and some global corporations that emphasize sustainability, including IKEA, supported it. Any company that meets the revenue threshold and sells or produces goods or services in California will have to comply, including such large, global corporations as varied as Amazon, Chevron, McDonalds, Kroger and Walmart. Businesses must report not only the tons of gases they emit globally from all of their own global\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Students want action to save world from Climate change\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Students are worried about this year\u2019s drastic climate change events \u2013 and say they won\u2019t let politicians continue to ignore the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival,\u201d said Valencia Hepburn, IT Cyber Security junior. \u201cThis generation feels as if we have to expedite our dreams, goals or aspirations before the earth is \u2026 destroyed.\u201d The federal government reports that 2023 has been a milestone in climate change. The summer brought the world\u2019s hottest temperatures and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the country has set a record for climate-related natural disasters in a single year, including fires, floods and ferocious winds. The combined estimated cost of the 23 disasters reported through September is more than $57.6 billion. \u201cPoliticians have been blind to [climate] change,\u201d said Aleeha Zafar, doctoral candidate in Technology studying human-computer interaction and extended reality. \u201cWe need a government that is pro-climate change and that is intending to make legislation to \u2026 reduce the effects of climate change.\u201d Students say they will try to drive improvement by supporting pro-climate-change candidates. \u201cI will always support and vote for candidates that actually have concerns and take actions to rectify climate change,\u201d said Madison Sanders, Marketing junior. Emilee Allen, a graduate in Technology , agrees. \u201cI am definitely more likely to vote for a candidate who promises to fight climate change. This is one of the main things I look for in candidates, especially presidential candidates.\u201d Andrew Urycki, a senior Integrated Health Sciences major, does not understand politicians who are not passionate about the issue. \u201cIf a candidate doesn\u2019t believe in climate change, they are immediately written [off] as a viable candidate for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how they can\u2019t discuss it and make stopping or slowing it down part of their campaign.\u201d A survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults last month found most are increasingly concerned about climate change. About 55% of respondents said they have grown significantly or somewhat more concerned about the effects of climate change in recent years. About half (49%) said they have personally experienced extreme weather events in the past month. Extreme heat (71%) tops the list of personal extreme weather experiences, followed by poor air quality (49%), severe thunderstorms (39%) and heavy rainfall (38%). The survey\u2019s most surprising finding: About one in four (23%) respondents said it will get more difficult to stay in the area they currently live in due to climate change.

The program\u2019s authorization expired on Sept. 30. The National Dam Safety Program is the primary source of federal support for state-level dam safety programs. Led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the program supports states with resources for training, staffing needs, emergency planning, and dam inspection and monitoring activities. The U.S. is home to roughly 92,000 dams, including nearly 6,000 non-federal high-hazard-potential dams, many of which are in small or rural communities that cannot afford repairs. Federal assistance through the National Dam Safety Program plays a critical role in safeguarding downstream communities from the impacts of dam failure, helping to reduce overall dam operating costs and providing resources for training, staffing needs, emergency planning, and dam inspection and monitoring activities. \u201cAs climate change increases the risks of extreme flooding and threatens our nation\u2019s water infrastructure, we cannot afford to go backward in our commitment to address dam safety,\u201d said Senator Padilla. \u201cOf California\u2019s 1,530 dams, more than 800 are classified as High Hazard Potential. Without consistent maintenance and repair, these dams and thousands of dams across the country will be at risk of failure, jeopardizing lives. We urgently need to reauthorize the National Dam Safety Program so we can keep our nation\u2019s dams up-to-date and help disadvantaged communities invest in necessary infrastructure repairs.\u201d The legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). Representatives Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.-11) and Annie Kuster (D-N.H.-02) introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. Specifically, this legislation would: Reauthorize the National Dam Safety Program through FY 2028.

He struck notes of his traditional unity message, pledging to work with the new Republican House leadership and touting his legislative accomplishments in the past year, but Biden also laid out an Average Joe America vision for 2024 full of poll-tested, middle-of-the-road issues, as well as a healthy dose of left-wing populism. And he showed a clear contrast between himself and right-wing House Republicans, who couldn't help themselves, hectoring Biden repeatedly despite newly minted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy explicitly instructing them beforehand not to do so. It's hard to be both confrontational and paint yourself as reasonable, but for many in the middle and center-left, Biden likely walked that line well. The president didn't call for a whole lot of new policy initiatives from the new Congress \u2014 beyond, for example, ending what he called \"junk fees\" in travel, entertainment and credit cards. It showed he's gearing up for campaign mode \u2014 to \"finish the job,\" as he said some 12 times in the speech \u2014 and that he's likely going to campaign on what he's already done by drawing a big-picture distinction between his vision for America and Republicans'. Here are five takeaways from Biden's speech: 1. The speech had to make Democrats more comfortable with the idea of Biden as the standard-bearer again in 2024 Lots of surveys show Democrats would prefer someone else to run in 2024 instead of Biden, mostly because of his age \u2014 though no one can definitively point to who the alternative should be. Biden is 80 years old and would be the oldest president to run for reelection. And he has suffered from a lack of intensity with rank-and-file Democrats, but he showed in this speech he can ably make and prosecute the case \u2014 not just for reelection, but also for Democratic values. 2. Biden tried to bait the right, and it worked Some of what is likely to make Democrats comfortable is the pluck he showed \u2014 the willingness and ability to spar with Republicans and depict them not as normal, but extreme. The best example of this was on Medicare and Social Security. He deftly riled up House Republicans, accusing some of wanting to cut the popular entitlements. He was careful in that section to note that \"some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.\" That\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Clayton addresses HCS stakeholders at annual State of Schools breakfast\ndate: 2023-10-24\nbody: This past Friday, the Hartselle Area Chamber of Commerce held its annual State of the Schools breakfast at Hartselle First Methodist Church. The event gave Hartselle City Schools superintendent Brian Clayton the opportunity to address those in attendance and outline the progress Hartselle City Schools have made over the past academic year, as well as vision casting for the future. Clayton began his presentation by outlining his vision for Hartselle City Schools, which he said is to inspire and prepare all students for learning, leadership, and life. \u201cIf we keep the main thing, that teacher and student in the classroom every day and give them our support, we will be successful with our mission,\u201d he said. As part of his presentation, Clayton outlined a number of highlights from the 2022-23 academic year. Some of which were attendance rates for all HCS schools over ninety percent, ranking number one in college and career readiness among public schools, continued improvement in ACT scores and the strength of HCS\u2019s career and technical education program. On the future of HCS, Clayton said, \u201cThe difficult job that we have in Hartselle is when things are really good, how do you improve upon them? I think it comes with a mindset, which our staff, faculty and administration has, is to continue not to be satisfied with where you are.\u201d Clayton added that he would like to see HCS continue to do the things that have gotten the system to where it is, but also continue to try and improve. In this respect, Clayton emphasized addressing the continued mental health crisis facing the nation and focusing on new ways to address the needs of the students. \u201cIn Hartselle our kids work hard, our teachers work hard, and our administrators work hard. And we\u2019re going to continue to try to do that,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cOur students represent the leaders for tomorrow. When I first got here we established a student advisory group and they come and meet with me once a quarter and they have been a great encouragement to me.\u201d The event was sponsored by Redstone Federal Credit Union, Hartselle Enquirer, Cerrowire and Sonoco. Additional sponsorships were provided by Hartselle Utilities, JT Ray Company, Alabama Education Association, The Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind and Bailey Harris Construction.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: NYC Museum School Administration Fails to Distribute Jewish Student Union Statement on Hamas Attack in Weekly Newsletter, Cites DOE Regulations\ndate: 2023-10-24\nbody: A statement written on Oct. 12 by the Jewish Student Union (JSU) of the NYC Museum School denouncing the Oct. 7 terror attacks on Israel by Hamas was delayed by multiple offices within the NYC Department of Education (DOE), namely the press, superintendent, legal, and bureau safety office. Although approved for The Gallery, it was denied a suitable platform for publication by the administration of the school in the weekly newsletter, who claimed they were following guidelines established by the Chancellor. The statement, a coordinated effort between the members and faculty advisors of the JSU, grieved the violence and civilian casualties in both Israel and Gaza. It reads as follows: The Jewish Student Union would like to express its deepest condolences in response to the recent terrorist attack by Hamas and the tragic loss of life in Israel and Gaza. This devastating event is deeply affecting and bringing distress to members of the Jewish Student Union, as well as the broader Museum School community. As a school, it is our responsibility to condemn terrorism across the globe and mourn the casualties of thousands overseas. The Jewish Student Union would like to extend our support to anyone who needs it during these turbulent times.

This year\u2019s report delves into the role of education in tackling the increasingly complex and intensifying challenges posed by climate change. India, like many parts of the world, continues to bear witness to the dire consequences of climate change through climate disasters and biodiversity losses. Education\u2019s full potential to shape a generation that understands the gravity of this urgent issue and equip them with the tools to combat it must be realized now. The National Education Policy 2020 underscores the importance of making environmental education an integral part of school curricula at all stages. In order to address climate change in India, the Ministry of Education strongly believes in the role that education can play in resolving impacts of climate change. This report by UNESCO is very timely as it comes at a time when India is making significant strides in working on the issue of climate change. Shri Sanjay KumarSecretary, Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education Education is a transformational tool in our fight against climate change \u2013 when we know better, we can do better. Educational systems must adapt to equip younger generations with the knowledge, skills and competencies to prepare them for the impacts of climate change. This year\u2019s UNESCO State of the Education Report for India is dedicated to the pivotal role of education in addressing climate change. We can see from the research that India has already taken some significant steps in this direction, and in doing so, is helping to promote sustainable and long-term solutions to this global challenge. Tim CurtisDirector, UNESCO New Delhi Regional Office The National Council of Educational Research and Training\u2019s (NCERT) commitment to addressing climate change through school education aligns seamlessly with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The NCERT is delighted to know that the UNESCO New Delhi Regional Office has developed this report on the pivotal theme of education to address climate change and I trust this report will be an informative guide for programmes directed towards climate change education.

Comscore, VideoAmp, iSpot Get Early Nod From TV-Network Consortium Aiming to Devise Nielsen Rival Coverage of the 15-minute speech lasted from approximately 8 pm to 8:22 pm ET, varying by network with nearly 65% of the 20.3 million viewers tuning in to the president\u2019s speech on broadcast networks, Nielsen reports. 35% of the audience watched on cable networks. People ages 55 and up make up the majority of the audience at 15.94 million and averaged an audience rating of 15.7. Notably, the adults 18-34 key demo made up only 4% of the Thursday night audience. Biden addressed the nation on the U.S.\u2019s response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, telling his constituents why it\u2019s necessary to show continued support for America\u2019s partners in Israel and Ukraine. \u201cThe security package I\u2019m asking congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israel\u2019s security that will sharpen their qualitative military edge which we\u2019ve committed to,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAt the same time, President Netanyahu and I discussed the critical need for Israel to operate by the laws of war. That means protecting civilians in combat. The people of Gaza urgently need food, water, and medicine.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:35AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Major natural disaster response efforts\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Phil Scott seeks major disaster declaration from White House to aid in Vermont\u2019s recovery efforts\ndate: 2023-07-13\nbody: Updated at 5:49 p.m. Days after floods ravaged Vermont, and with more severe weather in the forecast, Gov. Phil Scott is seeking an additional major disaster declaration from the White House, which \u2014 if approved \u2014 could open up the state to receive even more federal disaster relief funds. Scott announced his intentions to seek the additional federal aid at a Thursday morning press briefing, one day after officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, traveled to Vermont to assess the flood\u2019s catastrophic damage, trudging through Barre City\u2019s mud-covered streets . By Thursday afternoon, his request was on its way to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk. \u201cThe disaster declaration is one of the reasons it was important to have (FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell) and members of her team here yesterday to see the enormous needs we have as we move forward,\u201d Scott told reporters. The major disaster declaration sought by the governor is separate from a disaster declaration already approved by Biden on Tuesday. The approved declaration has helped to deploy FEMA response resources to the state, with the feds picking up 75% of the tab. An additional declaration would offer federal resources, and potentially millions of dollars, as Vermont moves from its emergency response toward recovery. In response to a question Thursday morning, Scott declined to estimate how many federal dollars could come Vermont\u2019s way if Biden approves his request. \u201cIt would be a guess and I don\u2019t think I should be guessing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much damage that we haven\u2019t seen yet locally, and so much residential damage and business damage and so forth.\u201d Vermont\u2019s farms have also been rocked by this week\u2019s floods , though federal aid to farmers would be approved through a separate disaster declaration issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Vermont officials last month requested one such declaration from USDA , after a late spring frost decimated millions of dollars in fruit crops. If approved, a major disaster declaration could be two-pronged. For one, it could bring federal dollars for public assistance, meaning repairs to vital infrastructure. Additionally, it could deploy funds to Vermonters who suffered financial losses due to the floods \u2014 in many cases, Vermonters whose homes were severely damaged. Under the Stafford Act, each household may be eligible for up to roughly $41,000 to help cover un- or under-insured damages.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Remove FEMA from Homeland Security bureaucracy. It will quicken natural disaster response. | Editorial\ndate: 2023-10-01\nbody: The Federal Emergency Management Agency has to be faster on its feet than just about any agency. Whether responding to a Hawaii fire, a California flood, an Alabama tornado, a Vermont storm or a Florida, Louisiana or Puerto Rico hurricane, FEMA forces must be on the move even before disaster strikes, to reduce misery and accelerate recovery. It's incumbent on the government to remove any unnecessary hindrance to the speed of that response. That's why a bipartisan proposal to elevate FEMA to cabinet-level authority merits serious consideration, to take it out from under the sway of a larger federal bureaucracy, the Department of Homeland Security. In the anti-terrorism reaction of the post-9/11 years, having FEMA under military supervision had a logic to it. Even now, seamless coordination between FEMA and the military \u2014 and many other agencies \u2015 is a must during major domestic emergencies. But with the nation's increasing focus on climate-related disasters, it makes sense to return FEMA to its original status as an independent arm of the government, reporting directly to the President and focused uniquely on its task at hand, rather than having its response slogged down by being just one of more than 20 agencies under the DHS bureaucratic umbrella. FEMA could report to the president:U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz offers bill to help speed up recovery after natural disasters Proposed by U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Parkland, Fla. Democrat who previously served as Florida's emergency management director, and Louisiana Republican Garrett Graves, who also has plenty of experience dealing with the agency, the bill calls for virtually no changes other than its line of authority, and virtually no additional costs. Moskowitz, a former Broward County commissioner who took office just eight months ago, told us his experience as an emergency manager -- the first one elected to Congress -- made him aware of FEMA's challenges. As Florida's emergency manager, he would ask FEMA officials, 'why is the money not moving faster?,' or, why can't we create a new block grant program rather than FEMA trying to do housing out of headquarters?' or, why can't we innovate?\" The answer he got, from FEMA regional administrators and former FEMA administrators, was that as long as they were stuck in a giant bureaucracy, they couldn't move faster. \"The red\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: AI technology can aid rescue efforts during natural disasters, experts say\ndate: 2023-10-05\nbody: A woman is assisted after another earthquake in Antakya in Hatay province, Turkey. All photos by Reuters Space technology and satellites can be used to prioritise the worst-hit areas during natural disasters and help rescuers save lives on the ground, a space conference heard. Although the AI technology used to scour thousands of images from disaster zones is in its infancy, experts say the applications have huge potential. Speakers at the 74th International Astronautical Congress in Baku also said the latest satellite imagery and related software would be helpful for hard to reach areas or regions plagued by conflict, providing usable images in hours rather than days. The earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria in the early hours of February 6, 2023 claimed the lives of more than 40,000 people and displaced 100,000 others. The disaster has been used as a case study on how to better utilise space technology in the hunt for survivors when similar disasters happen in the future. The United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) provides an emergency mapping service and satellite image analysis following major disaster events, complex emergencies and crisis situations. Luca Dell\u2019Oro, chief of the Disaster Risk Management and Climate Resilience Section at UNOSAT, said satellite imagery can play a key role in identifying the hardest-hit areas. \u201cIn Turkey, the co-ordination response was mainly led by the National Disaster Management Authority. But in Syria, the situation was much more complex,\u201d he said. Mr Dell'Oro said that it was more challenging because of a lack of national capacity to co-ordinate response, and there was a huge issue with access. \u201cThere had been 20 years of conflict and right before the earthquake, there were 15 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and 7 million internally displaced people,\" he added. \u201cWe had been asking mainly to focus on Syria to estimate the level of damage, especially because of the lack of information in this area. \u201cOnce we collected the images, we were able to assess areas that were hard to be reached.\u201d Earth observation technology 2023 has been a particularly deadly year for natural disasters so far, with floods in Libya and China, earthquakes in Morocco, Syria and Turkey, as well as wildfires across Europe and tornadoes in the US.

We are committed to supporting our communities over the long haul and thank the Biden Administration for their continued partnership.\u201d The Presidential Major Disaster Declaration will help Californians in impacted counties through eligibility for several programs and supports that can include housing assistance, food aid, counseling, and medical and legal services. Today\u2019s declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Kern, Mariposa, Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Tulare, and Tuolumne counties. It also includes public assistance to help state, tribal and local governments with ongoing emergency response and recovery costs, and hazard mitigation. Additional counties may be added as further damage assessments are conducted, particularly in areas where record snowpack makes it difficult to accurately assess the full extent of damages. At Governor Newsom\u2019s request, President Biden previously issued a Presidential Emergency Declaration authorizing federal assistance to support storm response and recovery efforts. The Governor has proclaimed a storm state of emergency in 47 counties since the start of severe storms in late February, and last week issued an executive order to support flood response and recovery in Tulare Lake Basin communities. The Major Disaster Declaration further bolsters the state\u2019s ongoing response and recovery efforts to support communities across California, including the deployment of the California National Guard and other state personnel to perform lifesaving rescue missions; the mobilization of food, water, sandbags, cots, and other commodities to areas in need; and providing equipment and personnel to assist in the fortification of levees, clearing of debris and snow from roadways, medical support at shelters, and staffing support for local assistance centers.

Their main motive is to alleviate human suffering, offer vital resources, and help affected populations recover from the devastating impact of such events. These organizations mobilize resources, volunteers, and expertise to ensure that those facing the brunt of disasters receive immediate aid, including medical support, shelter, food, and other essentials. They serve as pillars of support, demonstrating the immense impact of collective humanitarian efforts in times of crisis. Let\u2019s explore a comprehensive list of global disaster relief organizations making a significant impact in times of crises and emergencies. 1. Dera Sacha Sauda In times of natural disasters, Dera Sacha Sauda consistently offers assistance and relief. Revered for providing moral support and hope, Dr. Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan Holiness\u2019s teachings empower individuals to rebuild their lives with confidence and resilience. His followers\u2019 humanitarian actions extend to helping those in poverty and those affected by calamities, making a positive impact on humanity. Formed in 2001 by his holiness, Shah Satnam Ji Green \u2018S\u2019 Welfare Force Wing excels in disaster relief. Notable aid during Haryana-Punjab floods in 2010 with 30,000 volunteers, providing tractors, meals, and more, earned widespread respect. In September 2014, Dera Sacha Sauda initiated extensive relief operations in flood-affected areas of Jammu and Kashmir, specifically in Kulgam District. Relief included food, utensils, blankets, medicines, and mineral water. This relief was provided with military cooperation and brought hope to thousands of flood victims. In September 2008, Orissa faced devastating floods, affecting 17 districts and over 4 million people. Dera Sacha Sauda\u2019s Green \u2018S\u2019 Welfare Force Wing provided aid to 9,095 families in 27 villages, overcoming challenges and delivering relief kits of rice, pulses, and clothing. 2.

Russian news reports said the crowd on Sunday surrounded the airliner, which belongs to Russian carrier Red Wings. Authorities closed the airport in Makhachkala, the capital of the predominantly Muslim region, and police converged on the facility. Dagestan\u2019s Ministry of Health said more than 20 people were injured, with two in critical condition. It said the injured included police officers and civilians. Sixty people were detained in the unrest, the Interior Ministry for the federal district that includes Dagestan said Monday. It was not clear if charges had been filed against any of them. Video on social media show some in the crowd waving Palestinian flags and others trying to overturn a police car. Antisemitic slogans can be heard being shouted and some in the crowd examined the passports of arriving passengers, apparently in an attempt to identify those who were Israeli. In a statement Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said Israel \u201cexpects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office added that the Israeli ambassador to Russia was working with Russia to keep Israelis and Jews safe. While voicing support for Palestinians in Gaza, the regional Dagestani government appealed to citizens to remain calm and not take part in such protests. \u201cWe urge residents of the republic to treat the current situation in the world with understanding. Federal authorities and international organizations are making every effort to bring about a cease-fire against Gaza civilians \u2026 we urge residents of the republic not to succumb to the provocations of destructive groups and not to create panic in society,\u201d the Dagestani government wrote on Telegram. The Supreme Mufti of Dagestan, Sheikh Akhmad Afandi, called on residents to stop the unrest at the airport. \u201cYou are mistaken. This issue cannot be resolved in this way. We understand and perceive your indignation very painfully. ... We will solve this issue differently. Not with rallies, but appropriately. Maximum patience and calm for you,\u201d he said in a video published to Telegram. Dagestan Gov. Sergei Melikov promised consequences for anyone who took part in the violence. \u201cThe actions of those who gathered at the Makhachkala airport today are a gross violation of the law! ...

Ukrainian forces have also \u201cmarginally advanced\u201d west of Robotyne, Zaporizhzhia, according to geolocated footage seen by the think tank. It comes as Kyiv said it had \u201csuccessfully hit a strategic object of the air defence system\u201d in western Crimea . Russian sources said the attack was carried out using \u201ccombined\u201d long-range weapons like ATACMS, storm shadow missiles and sea drones. The Russian Ministry of Defence confirmed its air defence systems destroyed eight Storm Shadow cruise missiles over the peninsula. If confirmed, this would be the first time Ukraine has used the top-tier missile system provided by the US to hit targets on the Crimean coast. Meanwhile, Russia has bulked up its forces around the devastated city of Bakhmut in the east and has switched its troops from a defensive posture to taking \u201cactive actions\u201d, a Ukrainian military commander said.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Ukraine Says It Is Ready to Repel Russia's Offensive Actions in Bakhmut\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Kyiv military officials said on Monday that Russia has bulked up its forces around the devastated city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and has switched its troops from defense to offense, but Ukraine has been preparing to repel the attacks. Russia captured Bakhmut, theater of some of the bloodiest fighting of the 20-month-old war, in May. Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in June aimed at retaking occupied land in the country's south and east, including Bakhmut. \"In the Bakhmut area, the enemy has significantly strengthened its grouping and switched from defense to active actions,\" General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine's commander of ground forces, wrote on Telegram. Volodymyr Fityo, head of communications for Ukraine's ground forces command, said Russian forces had been preparing since early this month to retake positions around Bakhmut lost during the Ukrainian counteroffensive. \"We saw this, the intelligence reported everything. We had been preparing, strengthening our defensive positions, engineering fortifications and pulling up reserves,\" Fityo told Reuters by telephone. \"This does not come as a surprise for us.\" Both men said Russian forces were particularly active near the Ukrainian-held town of Kupiansk in the northeast, where Fityo said Russia had numerical superiority. Reuters could not independently verify accounts on the battlefield. In its nightly report, the Ukrainian General Staff said Kyiv's forces remained on the offensive near Bakhmut. \"The enemy unsuccessfully tried to restore lost positions near Klishchiivka,\" it said, referring to a village south of Bakhmut recaptured by Ukraine in September. Russian troops also tried to advance in Synkivka, north of Kupiansk, but made no headway, it added. Russia has also been concentrating much of its efforts in recent weeks on a bid to encircle and capture Avdiivka, a strategic town southwest of Bakhmut.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: This Promise Is Exactly Why Russia\u2019s Putin Loves Trump So Much\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Donald Trump is making his position on this foreign policy issue crystal clear. Donald Trump bragged during a campaign speech about threatening to abandon U.S. allies, even if Russia attacked one of them. Trump appeared in Sioux City, Iowa, on Sunday. During his speech, he made a series of bizarre comments, including mistaking the city for Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and pronouncing Canada as \u201cCanya.\u201d But he notably also said he had threatened to withhold U.S. military aid from NATO members unless they paid the bloc more. He said, at one point, he told member state leaders, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to protect you any longer.\u201d \u201cThe head of a country stood up, said, \u2018Does that mean if Russia attacks my country, you will not be there?\u2019 That\u2019s right, that\u2019s what it means,\u201d Trump said to applause. \u201cI will not protect you.\u201d \u201cAnd the money came!\u201d Trump\u2019s refusal to step in even in the case of a Russian attack is notable considering how much he loves Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir Putin. Trump and Putin enjoy a particularly cozy relationship , and Trump has repeatedly praised the Russian president. Given the fact that Republican support for the war in Ukraine is on the wane, Putin must be overjoyed that the party\u2019s presidential front-runner is actively advocating letting Russia attack whichever countries it wants. Trump falsely claimed throughout his presidency that the other NATO members had failed to make sufficient contributions to the alliance. In 2018, he accused other countries of owing the U.S. \u201ca tremendous amount of money from many years back, where they\u2019re delinquent as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d He also threatened to withdraw the U.S. from NATO over the other countries\u2019 supposed unpaid dues. But in reality, the U.S. has never been shortchanged by NATO allies. \u201cThere is no ledger that maintains accounts of what countries pay and owe,\u201d Aaron O\u2019Connell, a former Obama administration National Security Council staffer, told NPR in 2018. \u201cNATO is not like a club with annual membership fees.\u201d That fact hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from resurrecting his NATO falsehoods during his current campaign. Trump also bragged about his threat to abandon NATO allies to Russian attacks during an early October campaign stop in Waterloo, Iowa.

Styled on the Bollywood theme, the \u2018Raaj Kapur\u2019 restaurant which is one of the three major Indian restaurants in Tashkent, is not new but at least 16 years old and is a hit among not only Indian tourists but also locals for its lip-smacking dishes. Three superstars from the Kapoor family \u2014 Randhir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor, and Shashi Kapoor \u2014 have also dined at the restaurant on different occasions. \u201cPeople in Uzbekistan are crazy about Bollywood and generations of people from Uzbekistan and Russia \u2013 even the young \u2013 are aware of Raj Kapoor and his cinema and regard him as Bollywood\u2019s numero uno. The restaurant attracts more crowd for its name and less for Indian food, which most visitors discover after enjoying a meal,\u201d Sameer Khan, Resident manager, Raaj Kapur restaurant told PTI. Housed in the Le Grande Hotel in Tashkent, the restaurant is a definite stopover for tourist groups from India and is popular for its Bollywood nights where Uzbeks also groove on top chartbusters from the 90s. While Khan, who is originally from Mumbai, manages the property, the idea of the restaurant was first conceptualised by Jay Al Atas, an Indonesian who fell in love with Indian food during a visit to the country and was also impressed with the craze for Raj Kapoor in Russia and Uzbekistan. \u201cA lot of Indian tourist groups come here on a regular basis while Uzbeks enjoy the food on occasions and also love clicking pictures here.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:36AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Kanye West's fashion collaborations\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Kanye West Clothing Line: Redefining Fashion with Yeezy\ndate: 2023-09-18\nbody: Kanye West, the legendary rapper, producer, and fashion guru, has revolutionized not just the music industry but also the fashion industry. His apparel line, Yeezy, has gained international acclaim and captured the imagination and closets of fashion devotees. The development of the Kanye West Clothing Line, its influence on the fashion industry, and the attractiveness of his new merchandise are all topics covered in this investigation. Kanye West Clothing Brand Website: Kanye West\u2019s foray into the fashion industry began as a daring experiment that quickly grew into a ground-breaking fashion enterprise. His eponymous clothing brand, Yeezy, debuted in 2015, and it was more than just another celebrity fashion endeavor. Instead, it signaled the arrival of a creative designer aiming to leave an everlasting impact on the industry. The Yeezy brand immediately acquired popularity for its minimalist aesthetics and distinctive combination of streetwear and high fashion. The official website of the company became the epicenter of this sartorial revolution, a virtual environment where style met innovation. The website\u2019s clean design and user-friendly interface made it easy for fans and fashion aficionados to explore the Yeezy universe. The website became the go-to place for all things Yeezy, from apparel collections to shoe launches. Kanye West Clothing: Kanye West\u2019s devotion to simplicity is at the heart of Yeezy\u2019s success. His clothes designs mirror his own minimalist views, with clean lines, neutral hues, and an emphasis on comfort. Kanye\u2019s attitude was new and groundbreaking in an industry that is frequently linked with extravagance and grandeur. The Yeezy apparel brand immediately became known for its high-quality fabrics and meticulous attention to detail. Each piece, from legendary Yeezy sneakers to giant sweatshirts, made a statement in and of itself. The fashion industry took notice of this break from tradition, and Yeezy\u2019s impact grew. Kanye West New Merch: Kanye West has perfected the art of merchandising in addition to his apparel business. His \u201cYeezy Drops\u201d have turned into worldwide events, generating unparalleled buzz and expectation. Kanye used his social media presence and devoted fan base to instill a feeling of urgency with each product release. The concept underlying these releases is both straightforward and inventive. A perfect storm of demand was produced through limited quantities, unique designs, and savvy collaborations with artists and designers. Fans anxiously awaited each release, and items sometimes sold out in minutes. Kanye West has skillfully exploited the nexus of fashion, music, and\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Kanye West\u2019s Lucky Me I See Ghosts Hoodie- A Journey Through Fashion\ndate: 2023-10-14\nbody: Kanye West, a name synonymous with innovation and creativity, has consistently pushed boundaries across various artistic domains. Be it his groundbreaking music or avant-garde fashion, West continues to redefine what\u2019s possible. In the realm of fashion, the Lucky Me I See Ghosts hoodie represents yet another intriguing chapter in his ever-evolving sartorial journey. The Birth of \u2018Lucky Me, I See Ghosts\u2019 Kanye West\u2019s fascination with fashion isn\u2019t a newfound interest. Long before he ventured into designing clothing, he was making a statement with his fashion choices. His foray into the fashion world commenced with collaborations and streetwear-inspired designs. Notably, in 2018, West introduced the \u201cYeezy Season 6\u201d collection, which gained considerable attention for its minimalistic appeal. However, the origins of the Lucky Me I See Ghosts hoodie can be traced back to his creative partnership with Kid Cudi. Both West and Kid Cudi, celebrated musicians in their own right, joined forces to create the musical ensemble \u201cKids See Ghosts.\u201d This collaboration didn\u2019t limit itself to the realm of music; it expanded into the fashion universe with the unveiling of this iconic hoodie. The Aesthetic Appeal of Lucky Me I See Ghosts One of the most striking facets of this hoodie is its minimalist design. The phrase \u201cLucky Me, I See Ghosts\u201d takes centre stage, subtly surrounded by a ghost-like aura. This simplicity has become emblematic of West\u2019s fashion designs, ensuring that the message remains the focal point. The choice of a neutral colour palette, typically black or white, adds to the enigmatic allure of the hoodie. This simplicity, coupled with monochromatic hues, renders it versatile and easily adaptable to various styles and occasions. More Than Just Fashion \u2013 A Message Woven In Kanye West is renowned for embedding deeper meanings into his creations. The Lucky Me I See Ghosts hoodie is no exception. The phrase itself, \u201cLucky Me, I See Ghosts,\u201d is a reference to their collaborative album title. However, it can also be viewed as an illustration of West\u2019s particular creative process. The hoodie might be read as an acknowledgement of the artistic inspiration he draws from his difficulties with mental health, as he frequently speaks candidly about them. On a larger scale, the statement encourages us to go under the surface and discover the remarkable, ethereal, and intangible aspects of our daily lives. It encourages us to seek inspiration in unexpected places, mirroring\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Kanye West Plays James Blake Collaboration, Wears \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d Shirt at Paris Fashion Week Show\ndate: 2022-10-03\nbody: Kanye West is at Paris Fashion Week. First, he walked the runway for Balenciaga. He then presented his own Yzy Szn 9 fashion show. At the show, West wore a long-sleeve T-shirt with the phrase \u201cWHITE LIVES MATTER\u201d emblazoned on the back. On the front is an image of Pope John Paul II and the words \u201cSeguiremos Tu Ejemplo,\u201d which translate in English to \u201cWe Will Follow Your Example.\u201d As Rolling Stone points out, \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d is categorized by the Anti-Defamation League as a \u201chate slogan\u201d that\u2019s been used by white supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Renaissance Society. On his Instagram story on Tuesday, October 4, West wrote (and deleted): EVERYONE KNOWS THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER WAS A SCAM NOW ITS OVER YOU\u2019RE WELCOME Yzy Szn 9 was streamed on YouTube. Naomi Campbell walked during the fashion show, which was, at a point, soundtracked by a new West collaboration with James Blake seemingly titled \u201cAlways.\u201d In an interview with Vogue, West explained the concept behind his new collection: \u201cThere\u2019s just people. From the same planet. And sometimes, in high school, it feels like we don\u2019t fit in. And in a situation like this, we have the opportunity to come together to express who we are.\u201d West has a history of controversial political remarks and gestures, such as regularly wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat in support of former President Donald J. Trump. In addition, in 2018, West memorably said on TMZ Live, \u201cWhen you hear about slavery for 400 years\u2014for 400 years?\u2014that sound like a choice,\u201d although he later attempted to walk back the remark.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Kanye West just rolled out 8 new looks from his fashion collaboration with Gap \u2014 here's how to buy them\ndate: 2022-02-23\nbody: Two new looks from \"Yeezy Gap engineered by Balenciaga\" Courtesy company Musician Kanye West and Gap announced a partnership in June 2020 West and Balenciaga creative director Denma released a new lineup for Gap on Wednesday. Eight of the \"looks\" will be available for purchase online at yeezygap.com and Farfetch . Musician Kanye West released more items for sale from his 10-year partnership with clothing retailer Gap, this one called \"Yeezy Gap engineered by Balenciaga.\" The artist collaborated with Balenciaga creative director Demna (who asked that press refer to him by only his first name) on the collection. \"I've always appreciated the utilitarianism and the accessibility of Gap,\" Demna said in a release accompanying the announcement. \"This project allowed me to join forces [with Ye] to create utilitarian fashion for all.\" West legally changed his name to \"Ye\" last fall. The complete lineup includes 25 \"looks\" that will be available later this year and 8 of them will be available for purchase online on Wednesday at yeezygap.com and Farfetch , according to the release. Ye has put out other items from this collaboration, including brightly colored hoodies in September 2021 and the first product, a blue puffy jacket in June 2021. The hoodie brought in the most online sales in a single day in the company's history , Gap said. First announced in June 2020, a delay in getting \"Yeezy Gap\" apparel to the public frustrated some Gap employees, the Financial Times reported in January 2022. Gap shares jumped as much as 42% after the collaboration was first announced and was viewed by investors as a link to younger customers, Insider previously reported . This latest clothing lineup was previewed Tuesday at Ye's Miami event for his album Donda 2 , according to the release. Ye said Friday that Donda 2 would only be available on the $200 device called Stem Player due to what he said is streaming services not providing adequate income to artists.

From the outside, the German sportswear brand\u2019s decision to sever ties with the Yeezy-frontman seemed like an informed, but reactionary one \u2013 West had been at the center of several controversies in the months leading to the split. An investigation led by Megan Twohey and recently published by the New York Times, however, found that issues existed since the partnership\u2019s earliest days. \u201cWhen the company ended the relationship last October, it appeared to be the culmination of weeks of Mr. West\u2019s inflammatory public remarks,\u201d writes Twohey. \u201cInside their partnership, the artist made antisemitic and sexually offensive comments, displayed erratic behavior, and issued ever escalating demands [over a decade]. Adidas\u2019s leaders, eager for the profits, time and again abided his misconduct.\u201d From 2013 to 2022, Ye \u2013 the being formerly known as \u201cKanye West\u201d \u2013 and the Three Stripes released over 250 pairs of adidas Yeezy footwear. Some of the partnership\u2019s most popular styles \u2013 Yeezy Boost 350 V2, Yeezy Slides, Yeezy Boost 700, Yeezy Foam Runners \u2013 restocked on a consistent basis, delivering on Ye\u2019s early promise of brining his products to everyone who wanted them (accessibility was a pain point of the artist\u2019s previous endorsement deal with Nike). The decision to frequently reissue product was also an economic one. Yeezys become a $1 billion business by 2021. Five years earlier, Ye\u2019s adidas line had brought in net sales of $65 million. The former-\u201cMr. West\u201d was benefiting immensely from the success of his Yeezy business, too \u2013 not just adidas. His deal with the sportswear behemoth was unprecedented: as a non-athlete, he was receiving a 15% royalty on net sales, in addition to at least $10 million a year guaranteed. An assessment by Forbes in August 2019 found that adidas Yeezy had helped the then-42-year-old become a billionaire, out-valuing his music assets. Behind-the-scenes, friction consistently arose between Ye and his German partner. In 2016, a new contract was drafted up by the Three Stripes. While meant to entice the artist, the document was also meant to better protect the brand.

{"question_id": 1252, "turns": ["[INST] You are a smart AI assistant. Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:36AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Census data release and its implications\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Pandemic-driven population declines in large urban areas are slowing or reversing, latest census data shows\ndate: 2023-06-28\nbody: The first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic took its toll on the populations of many of the nation\u2019s largest cities and metropolitan areas. During the peak pandemic year (July 2020 through July 2021), national population growth dropped to a new low due to diminished immigration from abroad as well as more deaths and fewer births. But it was the movement of residents within the U.S.\u2014from cities to suburbs and away from large metro areas\u2014that made the biggest impact on urban areas\u2019 population declines. Such movement was prompted by a fear of proximity to others in dense urban centers and, for some, the ability to work virtually. Now, the question becomes: Will this sudden dispersal of migrants lead to a long-term decline in urban centers and large metropolises? Or is it merely a blip, after which big city and metropolitan growth will remerge? Newly released census data for July 2021 through July 2022 suggests the latter, showing that the sharp population losses in urban centers and metropolises are lessening and, in some cases, turning into population gains.1 One aspect of this moderation is noteworthy: The rise in immigration from abroad to many large counties and metropolitan areas. An earlier Census Bureau data release revealed a sharp increase in the nation\u2019s immigration compared to pre-pandemic years (when the Trump administration enacted severe immigration restrictions) and early in the pandemic (when U.S. borders were effectively closed). The newly released data shows that many urban core counties and large metropolitan areas benefitted substantially from immigration over the most recent year\u2014in some cases countering a continued domestic out-migration to other parts of the U.S.\u2014while in other areas, domestic out-migration has tapered off. The new data also shows that natural increase (the excess of births over deaths) rose modestly at the national level and served to mute the large urban population declines of the previous year. Many urban core counties tempered or reversed their population declines The newly released Census Bureau estimates permit a look at population shifts in large urban core counties over 2020-21 and 2021-22, in the context of shifts during the previous decade. Figure 1 displays annual growth rates for counties classed as urban cores, inner suburbs, and outer suburbs, aggregated for the nation\u2019s large metro areas based on a typology created by Brookings Metro.2 The trends for urban core counties show the sharpest population decline in the first full pandemic year. While this was the largest aggregate rate of population loss since 2010, these counties, as a group, were already experiencing diminishing growth and decline since the mid-2010s. This was after core counties saw healthy growth levels earlier in the decade in response to the Great Recession, during which many young adults and would-be homebuyers became \u201cstranded\u201d in cities, only to disperse outward as the economy picked up. Nonetheless, the aggregate core county declines\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Upcoming Census Bureau Releases: Key Data Reports and Surveys to Watch Out For\ndate: 2023-10-21\nbody: The U.S. Census Bureau plans to release several data files and reports in the coming weeks. One of these is the Noisy Measurement File (NMF). The NMF is a statistical product created by the 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System&#8217;s TopDown Algorithm (TDA). The TDA adds differentially private noise to each calculation from the confidential data. This can cause internal and hierarchical data inconsistencies. However, a step afterwards corrects these inconsistencies and improves accuracy before the tables are published. The NMF will be released on October 23, 2023. The Bureau will also continue the experimental Household Pulse Survey. This project works to provide up-to-date data on the social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to help federal and state response and recovery planning. Data collection began on August 23, with data being released on a monthly basis. The next release is due for November 8, 2023. The 2023 National Population Projections will also be released by the Census Bureau. These projections will give a detailed analysis of the nation's population up to the year 2100. Subscribers will have access to these projections from 10 a.m. EST, Tuesday, November 7. The full release is scheduled for Thursday, November 9. A new report on the foreign-born population in the United States is also due to be released. The report will compare data from 2010 and 2022. The goal is to give insights into changes in the foreign-born population over the past decade. This report will be released on November 15. In addition, the Census Bureau will keep collecting data from schools for the School Pulse Panel (SPP). The SPP gathers data on various aspects of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students and staff in U.S. public schools. Also, detailed data tables from the 2022 Annual Business Survey (ABS) will be released on October 26. The ABS provides estimates on the number of firms, receipts, payroll, and employment by sector, among other business characteristics. The ABS is run by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES).Visit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.

This marked the highest enrollment count since 2019 of 76.1 million students, from which it was not significantly different. Since 2020, school enrollment has steadily increased and has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels; however, total school enrollment in 2022 remains lower than the 76.8 million students in 2018. Overall, the percentage of individuals age 3 and above enrolled in 2022 (23.7%) remains lower than in 2019 (24.3%). In 2022, the enrollment rate for children ages 3 and 4 in nursery school or kindergarten stood at 53.3%, 13.0 percentage points higher than enrollment in 2020. In 2022, total enrollment in nursery schools or kindergarten reached 8.4 million. Although this number is lower than enrollment of 8.8 million in 2019, this year\u2019s registration was substantially higher than in 2020 when 7.2 million students attended nursery school or kindergarten. Of enrolled elementary students in 2022, 27.6% had at least one foreign-born parent, while 29.4% of enrolled high schoolers had at least one foreign-born parent. Of enrolled elementary school students in 2022, 70.4% were White alone, 15.7% were Black alone, 5.9% were Asian alone, and 25.8% were Hispanic (of any race). Of enrolled high schoolers in 2022, 72.2% were White alone, 14.5% were Black alone, 5.7% were Asian alone, and 25.9% were Hispanic (of any race). In 2022, college enrollment remained lower than in 2019, with 17.3 million college students compared to 18.3 million in 2019. In 2022, 81.1% of students enrolled in college attended a public university or college. This is a 2.3 percentage point increase from 2020. For enrolled college students age 15 and over, 4.3 million students were also employed full-time in 2022, compared to 4.8 million college students in 2021. Another 4.7 million college students were employed part-time, while 8.2 million students enrolled in college were not employed. Detailed tabulations, related information and historic data are available on the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s School Enrollment webpage. The Current Population\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Census data shows thousands moving out of New York\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: (The Center Square) \u2014 New York saw its population shrink again last year, with hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing to Florida, New Jersey and other low-tax states. An estimated 545,598 moved out of the Empire State in 2022, offset by a net gain of about 240,000 people moving into the state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s latest American Community Survey. The census figures show that the most popular destination for people leaving New York was Florida, with an estimated 91,201 moving down to the Sunshine State. New Jersey was the second most popular state, picking up 71,670 former New Yorkers last year. Other top states for departing New Yorkers were Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Texas and California, according to the census data. The number of New Yorkers relocated to Texas hit an all-time high in 2022, or more than 30,000, the data shows. That's a 67% increase from 18,000 in 2019. The least popular destinations for fleeing New Yorkers in 2021 were Wyoming, Montana, Iowa, Mississippi and South Dakota, which each saw less than 500 people relocate from the Northeast state. Critics point to the state's high cost of living, a pressing housing shortage and other issues that are prompting New Yorkers to flee to other states. The population decline has major implications for the states, revenue and tax collections, federal data shows. New York lost an eye-popping $24.5 billion in state-adjusted gross income in 2021 as residents fled to New Jersey, Florida and other low-tax states, according to Internal Revenue Service figures. Based on income tax returns filed in 2020 and 2021, IRS data shows the Empire State lost more than 261,785 residents in a 12-month span ending last July, driven by \"domestic out-migration\" of people moving to other states. The data shows the state lost an estimated $45 billion in taxable income during those two years. Overall, New York lost the ability to tax a cumulative $1.1 trillion in adjusted gross income due to net out-migration from 2000 to 2020, according to Wirepoints, an independent research firm. In 2020 alone, the state would have collected nearly $144 billion in AGI to tax had it not been for the yearly migration losses. New York was ranked second to last in the nation among 50 states in the Tax Foundation's 2024 State Business Tax Climate Index, released this week, which showed the average resident pays $2,273 a year in state and local taxes. Democratic lawmakers in Albany have pushed to increase taxes even higher, with proposals for a new surtax on New York's earners making above $5 million a year.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Understanding the 2020 Census Data Privacy: How Differential Privacy Works for Our Community\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: This is the fourth in a series of briefs describing disclosure avoidance methods used to protect 2020 Census data products and the implications of those methods for data users.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:36AM\nGiven a question from a America user: List of acquisitions by Google parent company Alphabet\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: What is Alphabet, Google's parent company?\ndate: 2023-10-14\nbody: Readers like you help support Android Police. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More. Rebranding gives businesses an image refresh and a competitive edge in an era of dynamic markets. Google underwent it in 2015, creating the Alphabet we now know as its parent company. Its birth has made it possible for its divisions to operate independently. Each remains a part of the company while handling projects beyond the internet search engine, advertising, or making new Google Pixel phones. Google remains the Google you know but falls under Alphabet as a subsidiary and the largest shareholder. It runs alongside Waymo, Calico, and other companies in its diverse portfolio. Learn more about Alphabet, who runs it, and other information in this post. What is Alphabet, and is it the same as Google? Alphabet is a multinational technology company that Larry Page and Sergey Brin created on October 2, 2015. Page and Brin are Google's co-founders and restructured the popular technology company to expand and diversify their operations. Alphabet and Google aren't the same. The former became the parent company, and the latter is now a subsidiary of it. Google shares have also converted to Alphabet stock and retain their ticker symbols as GOOG (Class C shares without voting rights) and GOOGL (Class A common stock) on the NASDAQ stock exchange and other platforms. According to Page in an open letter, the name Alphabet fits the rebranding as it's a \"collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search.\" It also reflects in the website address as abc.xyz. Nothing about how you use Google's products and services has changed. The Workspace apps, YouTube, and Maps, among others, remain intact. The difference is in the corporate structure. Current and future subsidiaries under Alphabet have more autonomy to chase separate goals and enter new markets. Also, Alphabet began generating financial reports in three segments on a quarterly basis. They report the profit and losses for Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. Before that, there were reports for only Google and Other Bets. The segments operate as follows: Google services: Apps or products covering different aspects of technology, communication, and information. They also generate most of the company's revenue. For example, Google Search, Maps, Play, Search, Chrome, and YouTube. Google Cloud: Cloud-based data management tools for individuals and businesses. For example, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Datastore, and Firebase. Other Bets: Subsidiaries and innovative projects not part of the company's core operations. For example, DeepMind and Waymo. Google's overhaul makes the new company more accountable. Its introduction of the above divisions allows investors to monitor the financial performance of core services and startup projects.

The world's largest provider of search and video advertisements reported a net profit of almost $19.7 billion, the company said. It was 7 per cent up on a quarterly basis. The California company reported a 11 per cent annual surge in its last quarter\u2019s revenue to more than $76.7 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $75.9 billion. The double-digit increase in revenue came after four straight quarters of single-digit growth. Despite better-than-expected quarterly earnings, the company's shares dropped as much as 6 per cent in after-hours trading to $130.9 a share. The company\u2019s stock closed 1.7 per cent higher at $138.8 a share on Tuesday, giving Alphabet a market valuation of $1.76 trillion. \u201cI am pleased with our financial results and our product momentum this quarter, with AI-driven innovations across Search, YouTube, Cloud, our Pixel devices and more,\u201d chief executive Sundar Pichai said. \u201cWe are continuing to focus on making AI more helpful for everyone \u2026 there\u2019s exciting progress and lots more to come,\u201d he added. Alphabet earned more than 47 per cent of its third-quarter revenue, or nearly $36.4 billion, from the US market. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the company earned more than $22.6 billion, or more than 29 per cent of its total sales. Alphabet\u2019s operating income soared 24.5 per cent on an annual basis in the third quarter to about $21.3 billion. Its earnings for each share increased 46.2 per cent yearly to $1.55. Google services business \u2013 which includes advertisements, Android, Chrome, hardware, Maps, Search, Google Play and YouTube \u2013 accounted for nearly 88.6 per cent of the company\u2019s total sales. It added more than $67.9 billion to overall revenue, nearly 10.7 per cent more than the third quarter of 2022. Google\u2019s advertising revenue from Search, YouTube and other businesses increased 9.4 per cent to more than $59.6 billion in the third quarter. Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet, said the \u201cfundamental strength\u201d of the company\u2019s business was driven by growth in Search, YouTube and Cloud businesses. \u201cWe continue to focus on judicious capital allocation to deliver sustainable financial value,\u201d Ms Porat said. The total revenue from the cloud business grew an annual 22.4 per cent to over $8.4 billion in the September quarter, missing analysts expectation of $8.6 billion. Google Cloud includes the company\u2019s infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools and other services for enterprise customers. It generates revenue mainly from fees received for cloud platform services and workspace collaboration tools. \"Despite Alphabet topping quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, investors were disappointed by the relatively weak performance at its Google cloud platform,\u201d Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, told The National. \u201cGoogle Cloud sales growth came in below market expectations as customers cut back on cloud spending amid the current\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Google leads list of commercial property taxpayers in Santa Clara County\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Tech companies such as Google provide the lion\u2019s share of commercial property taxpayers in Santa Clara County. Google leads the list of the 10 largest commercial taxpayers on an assessed value of $9.54 billion, the San Jose Mercury News reported, citing a report from the county Assessor\u2019s Office. The other big firms represent a who\u2019s who of the nation\u2019s tech sector, including Apple ($2.88 billion), Apple unit Campus Holdings ($5 billion), Cisco Technology ($1.56 billion), Applied Materials ($1.41 billion), Intel ($1.32 billion) LinkedIn ($1.24 billion) and Planetary Ventures, owned by Google parent Alphabet ($1.56 billion). Non-tech companies Pacific Gas & Electric ($2.99 billion) and Westfield Malls ($1.53 billion) also made the top 10 list. Google shelled out $117 million in taxes, or 1.5 percent of its $9.54 billion in assessed property value, according to the San Jose Spotlight, which also cited the Assessor\u2019s report. PG&E followed with a tax bill of $86.8 million. The report shows an unprecedented 9.6 percent rise in business property value to $47 billion, second to only Los Angeles County, largely because of inflation and the rising cost of acquisitions. The property tax roll in Santa Clara County, which includes secured real estate and unsecured property such as equipment, rose to an all-time high of $661.2 billion as of Jan. 1, the Assessor\u2019s Office reported. The value of the county\u2019s property tax roll increased 6.7 percent this year from 2022, according to the agency. That\u2019s a slight slowdown in the annual increase compared to last year.

Santa Clara County properties had a combined assessed value of nearly $620 billion for 2022, which was an increase of 7 percent from 2021, when the property tax roll totaled almost $577 billion, the Assessor\u2019s Office reported. On the downside, a sharp decline in the number of properties that have lost value this year equals $4.7 billion, which the report largely attributes to residential properties. The number of properties that declined in value rose this year to 19,325, from 2,595 last year, according to the Assessor. Aside from a brief uptick in 2020 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, this is the first time the county has seen such a large decline since the financial crisis of 2008, County Assessor Larry Stone told the Spotlight. \u201cThe local economy and real estate markets have largely for the last nine years, (except during) the Covid year, been strong,\u201d Stone, the county assessor for 29 years, told the newspaper. \u201cI don\u2019t think economically the Fed\u2019s definition of a recession is in existence yet \u2026 (but this year) has a very strong opportunity to be the worst year in assessment roll growth that we\u2019ve had.\u201d \u2014 Dana Bartholomew\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Google-parent Alphabet reports quarterly revenue above estimates\ndate: 2023-10-24\nbody: \u00a9 Reuters.

It generates revenue through online advertising, cloud services, and hardware. Google is now an operating segment of Alphabet. The company was founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page and went public in 2004. Google's AdWords is an auction-based program that lets businesses display ads along with particular search results. Google's AdSense program enables websites in the company's network to serve targeted ads, based on search terms or web content, from AdWords advertisers. Most of the revenue generated through AdSense is shared with network partners. Alphabet also owns YouTube.com, the web-based video site. It has also expanded into mobile telephony with its Android smartphone operating system and into public cloud services. About 54% of Alphabet's revenue is generated outside the United States. On April 3, 2014, Alphabet's new nonvoting class C shares began trading under the ticker GOOG. Alphabet's publicly held class A shares switched to the ticker GOOGL. The effect of the new class C share issuance was a non-economic 2-for-1 stock split. On July 15, 2022, Alphabet executed a 20-for-1 stock split on its Class A, Class B and Class C stock. The stock split had no impact on the economic value of GOOGL shares. However, Nasdaq research suggests that stock splits often provide a modest boost to the share price.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Did Education Reform Just Become Inescapable?\ndate: 2023-09-27\nbody: The Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin published a piece not that long ago arguing that Democrats have an opportunity on K-12 issues: \u201cDemocrats would be wise to reclaim the issue of K-12 education, starting with a recognition that the United States has long been falling behind international competitors and suffered another blow with COVID. They might consider a multipronged approach at both the state and federal levels.\u201d Rubin\u2019s argument is intuitive: there\u2019s ample evidence that the pandemic left U.S. kids academically and socially reeling. There\u2019s also proof that American families are worried about their kids\u2019 well-being and academic progress. Related A Wave of New Political Polls Is Raising Red Flags for Democrats on Education As kids struggle, as parents and caregivers fret, some prominent conservatives are currently exploring whether public schools can be meaningfully improved if we give enough families public vouchers for private schools and/or if we can figure out precisely which books to ban. These are not serious responses to the problems \u2014 and anxieties \u2014 most American families face. Democrats would benefit if they offered something more substantive than this low bar. But what? Rubin suggests a three-pronged framework. Democrats should: Push for significant education funding increases Pay teachers better and hold teacher-candidates in training to higher standards Decentralize more decision-making authority to school districts who are willing to draft innovative plans for reaching \u201cthe goal of educational excellence, mastery of subject matter and parental satisfaction.\u201d It\u2019s a reasonable starting point. Education funding increases improve public schools . Teacher pay is low, relative to other professions requiring extensive credentialing , and it hasn\u2019t increased enough to keep pace with inflation . U.S. teacher training programs are not particularly effective, particularly when it comes to preparing candidates to teach students to read . The educational benefits of decentralization are less obvious: U.S. history is pretty clear that local control of schools often sustains inequities and fosters civil rights abuses. Absent top-down pressure to focus on equity, local ( and state ) decisionmakers regularly default to decisions that are convenient, comfortable and bad for historically marginalized communities . Funding inequities generally thrive under decentralization . The erosion of federal pressure to integrate schools gave local authorities room to resegregate schools through housing policies , gerrymandered enrollment zones and other surreptitious changes.

In the background of this discussion was recent history: A particular brand of bipartisan education reform \u2014 which emphasized charter schools and accountability for student test scores \u2014 dominated Washington during the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations. Now it\u2019s in the rearview mirror, and there\u2019s no indication it\u2019s coming back. The forum highlighted how the parties are further apart on education than at any point in recent memory. And the discussion pointed to why no bipartisan collaboration on education appears to be in the offing, despite nascent efforts to create one and unprecedented challenges faced by the country\u2019s schools. In short, the politics have changed and there\u2019s no education agenda that is unifying both parties. \u201cHow do you think about solutions that are going to feel relevant and are capable of building broad support in a different political landscape?\u201d said Hess. \u201cAnybody who says we do that by going back to the playbook that resonated between 1992 and 2012 is, I think, probably misleading themselves.\u201d The forum was the latest rumbling about the idea of reviving what had been a dominant strain of education policy. Last month, a small cadre of nonprofit leaders published a manifesto titled \u201cA Generation at Risk: A Call to Action.\u201d (This is a reference to \u201cA Nation at Risk,\u201d the 1983 federal government report that spurred a national bipartisan focus on improving schools.)

The panel will be chaired by Australian Education Research Organisation chair Lisa O'Brien and includes experts with diverse experience in school education and policy. The panel is due to deliver a report to federal, state and territory education ministers in October. This will include recommendations with the potential to shape the future of schooling in Australia. Read more: A new review into how teachers are educated should acknowledge they learn throughout their careers (not just at the start) What is the NSRA and why is it important? The NSRA is a joint agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, designed to lift student outcomes in Australian schools. It sets out national policy initiatives and reform directions that all governments agree to implement over a five-year period. The current agreement was due to end this year, but has been extended by 12 months until December 2024. This means the next NSRA will begin in 2025. Clare says the expert panel is a \u201cfirst step\u201d towards shaping the new agreement. While it is likely many teachers, parents and students will have never heard of the NSRA, it is a crucial policy. It is a central pillar of the policy architecture shaping how schooling works in our nation. It has significant power in setting the agenda for what governments do and how they do it. What is \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d of the agreement makes a powerful statement about what our governments value in education and deem necessary to pursue at the national level. How does the NSRA impact school funding? The NSRA is intimately related to school funding. However, it does not directly determine the model \u2013 known as the Schooling Resource Standard \u2013 used by the federal government to decide how it funds schools. The way it works currently is the NSRA sets out the initiatives and reforms that all governments agree on. Each state and territory then signs a bilateral agreement with the federal government. This sets out the specific actions they will adopt to improve student outcomes in line with the NSRA. Each bilateral agreement also sets out the funding individual states and territories will contribute as a condition of receiving Commonwealth school funding. The \u201cschooling resource standard\u201d (often referred to as \u201cthe Gonski model\u201d) is used in the bilateral agreements to measure what federal, state and territory governments contribute.

The state of the education system in America has caused a continuing achievement gap between students from low-income and minority communities. This has led to a growing demand for school choice programs that empower parents to choose the best educational environment for their children. As we explore the positive impact of school choice and the \u201cBlack Minds Matter\u201d project, let us start with a story of someone who has benefited from school choice: Danisha Allen. Danisha Allen was born and raised in the inner city of Newark, New Jersey. Growing up, she faced numerous challenges, including poverty, violence, and a failing public school system. Despite the odds, Danisha was determined to succeed, so her parents went on a quest to find the best educational options for their daughter. This pursuit led them to discover the benefits of school choice. Danisha\u2019s parents chose to enroll her in a private school, where she thrived academically and went on to pursue higher education. Danisha\u2019s story is a prime example of why school choice is so crucial in addressing the unequal opportunities in education. The current education system in America has significant flaws that hinder minority students\u2019 success, due to the funding disparities based on zip codes. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average expenditure per pupil in public schools with high concentrations of poverty was about $11,100 in the 2018-2019 school year, compared to an average of $12,47 in schools without poverty. This funding gap has resulted in a lack of resources and support for low-income students, leading to underachievement and dropout rates. A report by the National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed that in 2019, only 15% of African American students scored proficient or above on 8th-grade reading tests, compared to 43% of their white peers. School choice initiatives give parents the ability to select the best education option for their children regardless of their zip code. Private schools, charter schools, and voucher programs are examples of school choice programs. These initiatives often lead to better academic outcomes for students, increased parental satisfaction, and more competition and innovation in the education system. In Danisha Allen\u2019s case, school choice allowed her to access quality education, leading to better life outcomes\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Educators say student misconduct has increased \u2212 but progressive reforms or harsher punishments alone won\u2019t fix the problem\ndate: 2023-09-28\nbody: The 2022-23 school year was a particularly violent year for educators. In Florida, a high school student beat a paraprofessional unconscious. A 15-year-old in Georgia left her teacher with difficulty walking. And a group of students in Texas sent their assistant principal to the hospital after an assault. Recent headlines suggest the 2023-24 school year may not be much different. Such violence at school disrupts teaching and learning and has elicited calls to reform school discipline policies. As a policy researcher who studies school safety and discipline, I have seen two camps form with polarized and politicized views on school discipline. On the one side are those who seek more restorative responses to misconduct that emphasize building relationships with students and discipline policies that keep kids in school. On the other are calls for greater use of exclusionary and punitive practices like suspension. In my view, making schools safe requires school leaders not to get caught up in this either/or debate. Instead, I believe it requires recognizing a shared goal of safe schools and the need for a comprehensive approach to achieving it. Behavior and the pandemic Recent reports suggest these high-profile incidents of violence in schools are part of a general increase in student misconduct over the past couple of years. This contrasts with a decline over the prior decades. For example, the National Center for Education Statistics found that 84% of public school leaders felt the pandemic negatively affected student behavior. Another survey found two out of three teachers and leaders perceived more student misbehavior in 2021 than in 2019. Studies have shown that students who feel unsafe going to school have worse attendance rates than those attending schools with less violence and misbehavior. They also score lower on standardized tests, particularly when classroom instruction is disrupted. What\u2019s more, teachers who experience threats or physical violence from students are more likely to leave their positions, according to a study I co-authored in 2017. Restorative justice experiences backlash Over the past couple of decades, states and school districts nationwide have adopted school discipline reforms that prioritize relationships between peers and with teachers, positive incentives for good behavior and prevention of misconduct. These policies, often implemented as part of restorative justice initiatives, focus on building community and a positive school climate instead of removing kids from school. But as school violence persists, these restorative justice reforms are being\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:36AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Hurricane Lee\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Lee County set to revise emergency plan ahead of next hurricane season\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: LEE COUNTY, Fla. (WBBH) \u2014 Southwest Florida is in the home stretch of the 2023 hurricane season. As residents look ahead to several months full of sunshine, Lee County leaders are looking ahead to how they will plan for the next storm. The county will soon submit a new emergency management plan to the state. It\u2019s the very plan the county uses to guide it through decisions during hurricanes, including whether or not to order evacuations. \u201cThere are a number of experts at the table going through this to make sure we\u2019re making our community safe and making the right decisions for them, and that\u2019s what is key,\u201d Lee County manager Dave Harner told NBC2. Harner and public safety director Ben Abes sat down with NBC2 to talk about the part of their plan that focuses on evacuations. It\u2019s changed over time to account for changes made by the National Weather Service, including a major update in storm surge modeling in 2010. \u201cThe new SLOSH models for storm surge increased the evacuation areas in Southwest Florida,\u201d NWS Meteorologist Daniel Noah explained to NBC2. \u201cWe have the better elevation data and better model data of what\u2019s going to happen to that water, and we found out that it will potentially cover larger areas and they are at threat.\u201d Noah said while the National Weather Service is not involved in evacuation decisions, they are giving information to those who are making the calls. And that information has only gotten better with time. \u201cBut it\u2019s still not perfect,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou\u2019re making decisions based on an imperfect forecast. But we have to account for the risk in our decision-making.\u201d In Lee County, the new storm surge maps in 2010 prompted a change in their decision-making. With the latest zone maps raising concerns of over-evacuation and evacuation timing, the county shifted from a \u2018Just-in-Case\u2019 methodology to a \u2018Just-in-Time\u2019 approach. \u201cThe changes that occurred in 2010 with storm surge and wind and the separation and now different products being available to help us make decisions in a different way, that has now continued to evolve into better products and products that better inform the decisions,\u201d Abes explained. For the most recent Hurricane, Idalia, evacuations were never ordered. The storm steered west enough to spare southwest Florida the worst of its impacts. Evacuations were ordered for Hurricane Ian, but in the wake of a storm that claimed dozens of lives in Lee County alone, leaders were scrutinized that orders came too late and didn\u2019t follow their own plan. According to a storm surge matrix within the plan, a 40% chance of 4 feet of storm surge indicates the need to evacuate Zone A. Those odds were in the forecast on Sunday night, 3 days before Ian hit, as the National Hurricane Center was predicting 4 to 7 feet of storm surge for the coastline. And yet, the evacuation order wasn\u2019t issued until Tuesday morning. \u201cCorrect, and there\u2019s a couple of factors that go into that,\u201d Abes responded. One of them, he explained, was the uncertainty of Ian. It was originally tracked to make landfall further north. Abes also said the matrix only determines the need to evacuate \u2013 not when. \u201cThat is the next important point. This may indicate the need for evacuation, but it doesn\u2019t indicate the timing,\u201d he explained. Abes said there are many variables that go into that, and that their decisions are not as black and white as the matrix would appear to suggest. \u201cThat is not the only thing that we take into consideration, and I think that\u2019s really important to explain,\u201d Abes said. \u201cAgain, with the rapid advances in technology, there are other forecast products that we consult with, and again, other forecast products that have become more reliable over time.\u201d Harner admitted that adding more context to the evacuation plan could help the public better understand exactly how they\u2019re making decisions. \u201cI think that\u2019s important,\u201d he said. Harner also admits they could add context in press conferences leading up to a storm as well. That was among the recommendations laid out in a Hurricane Ian after-action report, which determined the timing of the evacuation orders did align with the county\u2019s plans, but recommended they be more transparent as they make those decisions. \u201cWe should probably do more of that. Again, just to be transparent and show them the process of what we\u2019re going through and what we\u2019re thinking and the information we\u2019re receiving as well,\u201d Harned said. \u201cYou\u2019re only as good as what you\u2019ve learned from the past, if you continue to do what you did in the past, obviously you\u2019re not learning.\u201d The county\u2019s evacuation plan is just part of its bigger emergency plan. That is required to be revised and submitted to the state for approval every four years. That was supposed to happen last year, but because of Ian, the county was granted an extension. A new version of the plan will be submitted to the state in December, Abes said, and they\u2019ll go through a process to make corrections and revisions. Count on NBC2 to let you know what changes are made.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: LEE COUNTY | Study shows more people are moving after Hurricane Ian\ndate: 2023-10-24\nbody: Over one year after Lee County was named one of the nation's top ten fastest-growing counties one study is claiming Hurricane Ian is reversing those numbers. A report by John Burns Research and Consulting showed in 2021, the year before Ian, Lee County had a net inflow of 7.7% compared to total moves in 2021. The study said this is equal to 5,698 more move-ins than move-outs. After Ian, the numbers show Lee County had a net outflow of 9.5% compared to total moves in Current. This means Lee County had 5,858 more move-outs than move-ins.

This cloud-native, application platform will enable developers and operators to define, deploy, and collaborate on cloud-native applications across public clouds and private infrastructure. First things first, if you're a serious enterprise user, you might be thinking: \"That's not RADIUS!\" You're right. It's not. The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is commonly used in Microsoft software stacks to deliver remote and cloud Active Directory (AD) services. The cloud-native Radius has nothing to do with RADIUS. Also: Microsoft has over a million paying Github Copilot users: CEO Nadella The new Radius aims to simplify the development, management, and operational hurdles in cloud-native computing's complex landscape. As Russionvitch said, \"Cloud native technologies like Kubernetes have made building applications that can run anywhere easier.\" Indeed, as I've argued myself, Kubernetes is the foundation for hybrid clouds. But, that's much easier to say than to do. You may have noticed it's not simple at all to write an application that will run the same on Azure and, say, Amazon Web Services (AWS). As Russinovich explained, \"While Kubernetes is a key enabler, we see many customers building abstractions over Kubernetes, usually focused on compute, to work around its limitations: Kubernetes has no formal definition of an application, it mingles infrastructure and application concepts, and it is overwhelmingly complex.\" You can say that again! So, as \"developers inevitably realize their applications require much more than Kubernetes, including support for dependencies like application programming interface (API) front ends, key-value stores, caches, and observability systems,\" Microsoft has introduced Radius to give them the additional tools. Also: I took this free AI course for developers in one weekend and highly recommend it Russinovich added, \"Radius meets application teams where they live by supporting not just Kubernetes, but other popular infrastructure tools such as Terraform and Bicep, and by integrating with existing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems such as GitHub Actions. Radius also supports multi-tier web-plus-data to complex microservice applications like eShop, a popular Microsoft microservices cloud reference application.\" But, and this is the important bit, even though\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Understanding Microsoft Azure: Your Comprehensive Guide to Cloud Computing\ndate: 2023-05-22\nbody: Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provided by Microsoft.

Microsoft attributed this growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence tools, despite some clients prioritizing cost-saving initiatives. Among the three leading cloud providers, Amazon Web Services had the slowest rate of growth. Microsoft is leading the way in the highly competitive cloud-computing industry, surpassing its top competitors. The latest financial results for major technology companies have been released, with a particular focus on cloud services. Microsoft's Azure platform experienced an impressive growth rate of 29% in the third quarter. In comparison, Google Cloud reported a growth rate of 22%, while Amazon Web Services lagged behind with only 12% growth, less than half of Microsoft's expansion rate. Although AWS remains at the forefront in terms of overall market share, one possible reason for Microsoft's increasing business is that companies prefer to utilize Azure for running their artificial intelligence models. Microsoft already supplies the underlying computational capabilities for the widely-used ChatGPT chatbot and other OpenAI products, which it has been financially supporting since 2019. During a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated, \"Due to our leading position, we are witnessing the initiation of entirely new projects, specifically AI projects. It is important to note that AI projects encompass more than just AI metrics; they also encompass various other cloud metrics.\" The increase in Azure's growth by around 3 percentage points was attributed to AI, surpassing the 2 points that management had predicted. In comparison, Google's growth rate slowed down from about 28%, while AWS remained consistent with its second-quarter growth. According to a note to clients from Bernstein Research analysts, led by Mark Moerdler, Microsoft's results indicate that the company has taken the lead in AI from Google, suggesting that Azure could become a larger and more significant hyperscale provider than AWS. They also highlighted the importance of Microsoft's capital expenditures, which rose to $11.2 billion from $10.7 billion in the previous quarter. Microsoft might be experiencing faster growth compared to its main rivals, but all of them are placing significant emphasis on the significance of artificial intelligence. During Alphabet's earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Sundar Pichai stated, \"Today, more than 50% of all funded generative AI startups are Google cloud customers.\" Amazon's\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

View post on Twitter Under the new multiyear deal, SKIMS will become the \"Official Underwear Partner\" of the NBA, WNBA and U.S. Basketball. According to an NBA press release , SKIMS will also receive \"media exposure,\" including on-court signage during NBA and WNBA broadcasts, and mentions on the league's social media and digital platforms. View post on Twitter This is not the first time the brand has partnered with athletes: SKIMS partnered with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Additionally, the company brought on NFL defensive end Nick Bosa, NBA guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Brazilian soccer forward Neymar for a shirtless campaign to promote the new SKIMS men's line . View post on Twitter Kardashian launched SKIMS in 2019, and has seen a rapid rise in popularity, especially among Millenial and Gen Z customers. SKIMS was valued at $4 billion this summer.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Kim Kardashian's shape-wear brand strikes partnerships with NBA\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: SKIMS, the shape-wear brand co-founded by Kim Kardashian , has announced an exclusive relationship with the NBA, WNBA, and USA Basketball. The brand, which has grown in prominence in the four years since its introduction, is ready to change the concept of sportswear by becoming the official knickers of these major sports leagues. Kim K\u2019s brand intends to extend its impact to major athletic events, such as the NBA All-Star Game and the NBA In-Season Tournament, rather than simply outfitting athletes. Although details are limited at this time, the cooperation promises to elevate the sports-fashion relationship to new heights. Big moment for both brands \"I am incredibly proud of SKIMS' partnership with the NBA, as it is a reflection of SKIMS' growing influence on culture,\" Kim Kardashian expressed her pride in this unique partnership. She also emphasized the ability of fashion, sport, and talent to bring people from diverse backgrounds together. Kardashian's delight at the thriving collaboration is obvious in her message. Jens Grede, co-founder and CEO of SKIMS, underlined the NBA's modern approach and its significant impact on pop culture, entertainment, and design. The collaboration represents an exciting opportunity for both SKIMS and the NBA to engage the next generation of basketball fans. The brand's introduction into the realm of professional sports demonstrates fashion's ever-expanding reach in today's sports landscape. This announcement comes just two weeks after SKIMS launched its menswear branch, along with a high-profile ad starring NBA All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and other renowned sportsmen. SKIMS isn't new to sports; the company previously served as the official knickers partner of the United States Olympic Team during the Tokyo Summer Olympics in 2021. Kardahians and NBA go way back The Kardashian-Jenner family has a long history of involvement in sports. Several Kardashian sisters, notably Khloe, Kim, and Kendall have had high-profile romances with NBA players. The connection between SKIMS and the NBA appears to be a natural extension of the family's involvement with the sport. As the fashion business becomes more intertwined with the world of sports, SKIMS and the NBA's relationship could be a sign of more unexpected collaborations to come. It remains to be seen how this one-of-a-kind collaboration will develop, but it certainly offers an intriguing blend of fashion and professional basketball. \"SKIMS has quickly become one of our most culturally-influential brands.

The theory stemmed from Travis\u2019 description of Kim as \u201cf--king hot\u201d in his 2016 memoir, Can I Say . \u201cI obviously shared all that stuff because I wanted to move past it,\u201d Travis, 47, explained to the LA Times . \u201cIt was therapeutic for me.

You give people a little information and they think they\u2019ve solved the mystery of \u2018this is why they\u2019re fighting.\u2019 It\u2019s just so ridiculous.\u201d In his book, Travis admitted that he used to \u201csecretly check out Kim\u201d while he was hooking up with her friend Paris Hilton in 2006. However, both the drummer and Kim, 43, have insisted that nothing physical ever happened between them. When a fan asked Kim about the rumor in 2021, she replied, \u201cFalse narrative! We have been friends for years and I\u2019m so happy for him and Kourt.\u201d Travis and Kourtney, 44, were also friends long before they started dating. They finally got together romantically in the fall of 2020, and Travis proposed one year later. In May 2022, they tied the knot in Italy with Dolce & Gabbana styling them for the event. Kim and Kourtney began feuding later that year when Kim teamed up with Dolce & Gabbana to create her own collection with the brand. Kourtney felt that her sister was \u201ccopying\u201d her wedding vibe with the pieces she put together. She accused Kim of prioritizing business and money over their relationship. Tensions were high between the sisters for several weeks before they sat down and talked it out. All of the ups and downs were documented on season 3 of The Kardashians . The show\u2019s 4th season premiere featured a resurgence of the drama between the two, as it was filmed while the previous fight episodes were airing on Hulu. They're So Cool!

Kardashian, 43, took to Instagram to announce that her company had inked a deal with the men's and the women's basketball leagues, days after her company launched its first-ever underwear line for men. The TV personality shared a gallery of photos making her announcement, including images of her posing in the shadow of New York City's Brooklyn Bridge as she clutched a basketball. \"Introducing the SKIMS and NBA partnership,\" she captioned the photos. \"@SKIMS is now the Official Underwear Partner of the @NBA, @WNBA and @Usabasketball.\" This is not Kardashian's first foray into dressing athletes. In 2021, Skims landed a deal with Team USA to supply undergarments and loungewear for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. While Kardashian's latest Instagram announcement was met with largely positive comments, the tone was notably less upbeat on X, formerly Twitter , where a number of social media users expressed their objections to the partnership. \"We gotta boycott the NBA now,\" wrote one detractor, while another asked: \"Who allowed this?\" Referencing Kardashian and her sisters' past relationships with athletes, another commented: \"This is hilarious knowing that they [used] to say there's a Kardashian curse for athletes. But now they're wearing her underwear.\" Questioning the point of the deal, one X user asked: \"Why even there is an underwear partner?\" \"The good news for the players is they can just wear something else and no one will notice,\" another quipped. Amid the flood of derisory comments were several posts praising Kardashian for adding to her ever-growing fortune with the deal. \"Say what you want about Kim Kardashian ... But she is really about her business like,\" one commented. \"If the NBA players started playing in just their jerseys and SKIMS underwear, I actually might watch a game or two,\" said another. Referencing Kardashian's controversial comments about work ethic last year, another wrote: \"Y'all shouldn't have gotten upset when she said get your a** up and work 'cause she certainly is.\" Another X user said that while they're no longer a fan of Kardashian, they \"gotta give it to her when it comes to marketing, 'cause girl this is something.\" Meanwhile, Alyssa Milano was among the first cele\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Kim and Kourtney Kardashian Celebrate Corey Gamble\u2019s D&G Collab Post-Feud\ndate: 2023-10-28\nbody: Kim and Kourtney Kardashian seem to be finding the funny when it comes to their Dolce & Gabbana feud. Kim, 43, took to her Instagram Story on Friday, October 27, to repost a photo of Corey Gamble \u2013 who is their mom Kris Jenner\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 amid his recent D&G collaboration. Below the snap, Kim tagged Kourtney, 44, adding the side eyes emoji, \u201c .\u201d The Skims founder appeared to be poking fun at her argument with the Poosh founder, which viewers have seen play out over the last two seasons of The Kardashians. The tension began when Kim revealed she would be curating her own partnership with D&G after Kourtney designed her May 2022 wedding to Travis Barker around the fashion brand. \u201cIt feels awful that my sister used my wedding as a business opportunity. She chose the money over me. That\u2019s why she never truly asked me,\u201d Kourtney explained on a season 3 episode of the Hulu series in July. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she forgot to ask me or thought that I wouldn\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think she knew what to do if my answer was no.\u201d Keeping it in the family. Kourtney Kardashian and Kim Kardashian faced a major setback in their relationship following a business deal \u2014 and Hulu had cameras rolling as things got messy. During the trailer for season 3 of The Kardashians, which was released in April 2023, Kourtney and Kim took center stage as they hashed [\u2026] Kim, however, argued that she tried to wait and specifically didn\u2019t choose items that Kourtney wore during her Italian wedding weekend with Barker, 46. She also claimed that Kourtney had taken inspiration from her own overseas nuptials to now ex-husband Kanye West. \u201cI got married in Italy. Am I saying you copied me by getting married in Italy? Who performed at my wedding? Andrea Bocelli. Who performed at Kourtney\u2019s wedding? Andrea Bocelli,\u201d Kim said in a confessional. \u201cYou stole my f\u2014king wedding country and my wedding performer. Andrea Bocelli is my favorite male singer of all time, but I am copying your Dolce Vita lifestyle?\u201d While the women seemingly reconciled when they wrapped filming season 3, the tension reemerged when episodes began to air months later \u2014 which was caught in a dramatic phone call at the start of season 4. \u201cYou are talking about the bulls\u2014t details because it is all your egotistical selfish mind can think\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:37AM\nGiven a question from a America user: High School Football\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: High School Football: Loss shuffles playoff picture for Central High\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: It was not the way Central High envisioned closing out the regular season, failing to hold a late fourth quarter lead in a heart-breaking 28-21 loss at Amelia County. Lunenburg was looking to win their fifth straight in the series and take a 9-1 record into the Region 2A playoffs as the top seed. Instead, they will be 8-2 and may have to play the region title game, if they get there, on the road. \u201cThree turnovers didn\u2019t help with two interceptions and a fumble. We haven\u2019t been turning the ball over and take pride in that. Nonetheless, it happened. Hat\u2019s off to Amelia, though. They played well and made the plays,\u201d said Lunenburg coach Will Thomas. \u201cThey put a little stress on us defensively that we hadn\u2019t seen. We still had well over 300 yards of offense. We\u2019re just having a hard time stopping anybody, which is crazy because we only gave up 13 against Buckingham, the best team that we played. We gave up run plays, pass plays and we\u2019re not very good right now on that side of the ball.\u201d The Chargers led 13-0 in the first half, but Amelia rallied to grab a 14-13 advantage by half-time. However, Central High\u2019s ground attack \u2013 which churned out 366 yards \u2013 enabled them to take a 21-20 fourth quarter lead following a touchdown and successful two-point conversion. Another splendid rushing performance was turned in by senior two-way star Connor Mattox, who ran for 231 yards and a touchdown on 30 attempts. It puts Mattox over 1400 yards on the campaign. Last chance for Central High falls short With 35 seconds to go, Amelia re-claimed the lead. Tony Jones returned the ensuing kickoff to about the 20-yard line of the Raiders. As time expired, Lunenburg\u2019s final pass play in the red zone fell incomplete. In the latest power ratings, Lunenburg is No. 2 in Region 2A at 22.3, just barely ahead of Amelia 21.89 and trailing top-seeded Poquoson (24.22). Unless Amelia beats Buckingham, the Chargers will be the No. 2 seed in the opening round and likely draw a first round opponent of Southampton, who\u2019s currently 4-5 overall. Even as frustrating as the loss was for Lunenburg, their goals do not change. They\u2019re aiming to be the last team standing in Region 2A, no matter who they end up seeing in the playoffs. \u201cTo me, a regional runner-up doesn\u2019t mean as much to the rest\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Alabama high school football: Gadsden area rankings of top 10 football teams\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: Here are the all-class power rankings ahead of Week 10 of the high school football season in the Gadsden area.

To be eligible for the state's tax rebate , taxpayers must file their returns in the Old Dominion by the Nov. 1 extended deadline. This deadline is six months after the regular May 1, 2023, deadline to file 2022 Virginia state income taxes. If a resident filed his or her income taxes at the regular deadline, no additional steps are required to get the rebate. PRAMILA JAYAPAL WARNS BIDEN'S APPROACH TO ISRAEL COULD COST HIM VOTERS IN 2024 Rebates are worth up to $200 for individual filers and up to $400 for joint filers. Not every taxpayer in the state will be eligible for this rebate, but those with a tax liability are among those who are eligible. The Virginia Department of Taxation has created a website for residents to check if they are eligible for the rebate and how much money are eligible for in this rebate. The tax rebate from the state is going out now to eligible residents in the state, either via direct deposit or paper check, depending on how they received their refund earlier this year. Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) announced last week that the distribution of the tax rebate would begin on Oct. 25 to eligible taxpayers in the commonwealth, with distribution going out on a rolling basis over a three-week period. Youngkin said the rebates will help residents \"keep more of their hard-earned money.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \"We\u2019re excited to announce that tax rebates will begin to be distributed in the coming days. As Virginians continue to face inflation and high prices as a direct result of policies out of Washington, D.C., these rebates are an important step going into the holiday season to help Virginians keep more of their hard-earned money for gas, groceries and essentials,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"My administration has delivered over $5 billion in tax relief to Virginians, and we\u2019re pleased that these rebates will provide needed relief to Virginians,\u201d the governor said.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Stimulus Update: Thousands of Americans To Receive Up to $2,500 Checks Soon \u2014 Will Your State Send You One?\ndate: 2023-07-22\nbody: The possibility of a fourth federal stimulus payment has been on the table since the last of three Economic Impact Payments (EIP) was issued by the IRS to qualified Americans.

In Montana, for example, married filing jointly taxpayers can receive an income tax rebate up to a maximum of $2,500 if eligible. Some states have designated stimulus funds for targeted groups like teachers and energy savers, while others have provided bonuses to farm workers, essential workers and frontline workers. A growing number of cities \u2014 like Chicago, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Seattle \u2014 are sending stimulus payments to low income households this year, according to Ramsey Solutions. The Sun detailed an exhaustive list of job-, city- and state-specific stimulus check updates. Checking it regularly and looking at your city and state websites (and state Department of Revenue sites) for news on relief payments is wise. Make sure to follow up on any stimulus program payments and tax rebates that were already distributed this year to see if you were eligible for any benefit offered. There are some state-wide stimulus programs that are in full-swing or just getting started, some of which follow. Alaska The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend pays Alaska residents a portion of the state minerals revenue in the form of an annual dividend to benefit current and future generations.

Although the deadline is March 31 of the year for which you are applying, there are some exceptions. \u201cApplicants who filed an online application (web) and selected direct deposit and have been determined eligible for payment by September 22, 2023, will receive their 2023 dividend through direct deposit on October 5, 2023.

Only three days left to claim tax rebates up to $400 by filing your 2022 state income taxes. Don\u2019t miss out! The extended deadline for filing tax returns in the Old Dominion is November 1, 2023, which offers a six-month extension beyond the regular May 1 deadline. Final Opportunity for Tax Credit Eligibility This delayed deadline is, crucially, the final chance for people to be eligible for the tax credit. If they meet the requirements and submit their tax returns by the customary date, there are no further measures necessary for them to obtain the reimbursement. The rebate amounts vary, with individual filers eligible for up to $200 and joint filers potentially receiving up to $400. However, not all Virginia residents will be eligible for these rebates. Eligibility is primarily determined by having a tax liability, and the state has provided an official website where residents can check if they meet the criteria. Governor Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, recently announced that the distribution of these tax rebates will commence on Wednesday for eligible taxpayers across the Commonwealth of Virginia. Governor Youngkin\u2019s Perspective The distribution process will occur on a rolling basis over a three-week period, offering timely financial relief to those who qualify. In a statement, Governor Youngkin highlighted the importance of these rebates in the face of rising inflation and high prices driven by policies from Washington, D.C. He stated, \u201cAs Virginians continue to face inflation and high prices as a direct result of policies out of Washington, D.C., these rebates are an important step going into the holiday season to help Virginians keep more of their hard-earned money for gas, groceries, and essentials.\u201d He also proudly noted his administration\u2019s commitment to delivering over $5 billion in tax relief to Virginians, emphasizing the crucial role these rebates will play in providing much-needed financial relief. The rebates will be distributed through direct deposit or paper checks, depending on how individuals receive their tax refunds.

This time, millions are again waiting for the 4th stimulus check release date. In a published article in the U.S. News, nine states and cities are sending extra money as a form of 4th stimulus check to ensure that American families face financial problems amidst the increasing inflation rate and the impact of the pandemic. 4th Stimulus Check Release Date According to a published article in Ramsey Solutions, some states and cities have already released their own 4th stimulus checks to their residents. These states diverted some funds and sent them to low-income families and residents who needed financial assistance. Furthermore, the Internal Revenue Service has not yet released information but the 4th stimulus check release date. However, there are rumors that some lawmakers are pushing for a 4th stimulus check to face the effects of the inflation rate.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Arizona\u2019s Economic Lifeline: Everything You Need to Know About Stimulus Checks\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Arizona is one of the few states still conducting a Stimulus check. The nature of this however varies from time to time. This is a surprise as most other states have already wrapped up these relief programs. The Arizona Freedom Caucus drove hard negotiations. A stimulus check has been followed by many governments for the past year to combat the Economic Slowdown. In this program, the governors directly deposit money into the bank account of citizens to boost their disposable income and increase consumption power. This most often comes in the form of tax rebates. The said rebates would be made according to the number of dependents in the family. A family with a child under 17 years of age is entitled to receive $250 for each child. The maximum amount that can be received is $750. Meanwhile, the older dependents are entitled to get $100, with the maximum being $300 in this case. All this was negotiated and approved in the budget negotiations made earlier this year with the Republican leaders. Governor Katie Hobbs had signed a $17.8 billion dollar budget with an approved amount of &260 million as a tax rebate. The rebate is subjected to those citizens who have claimed Arizona\u2019s existing tax credit for dependents and filed a state income tax return for the years 2019, 2020 or 2021. In addition to that the family must have had a tax liability of at least $1 in either of these years. Another condition put forth is that only those who are dependents till the year 2021 are eligible. This implies that newly made parents in the year 2022 are not eligible under this scheme. The $100 rebate has no age criterion. It has also been mentioned that even if residents have live-in partners who do not work can be classified as dependents and thus, can avail of this $100 rebate. The deadline for declaration is November 15, and the issue of the same will begin on Oct 30.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Authorities say the Trooper Dakotah Chapman-Green stopped Cristobal Santana. Gunshots were fired and the trooper was hit in the leg. Santana ran off but was taken into custody and charged with Attempted Murder. He is also a suspect in the deadly shooting of his ex-girlfriend in Chicago.

As far back as January, Card\u2019s mental health had already started to decline, his family said. By May it was getting even worse, and they were concerned for his well-being, and that he had access to firearms. Despite some follow-up between local police and the Army Reserves regarding Card\u2019s apparent paranoia, verbalized threats to shoot people and recurrent aggressive behavior in recent months, the documents do not indicate that Card was ever taken into protective custody or judged mentally incompetent by a medical professional which is required to trigger Maine\u2019s yellow flag law. On Oct. 25, Card\u2019s repeated warning signs would prove fatal, when he would act on his threats in back-to-back massacres that claimed the lives of 18 and injured 13 more. Family seeks help On May 3, Card\u2019s ex-wife and their teenage son went to the office of the Topsham School Resource Officer with concerns about Robert Card, according to an incident report from responding officer, Sagadahoc County Deputy Chad Carleton. In all caps at the top of that report, a notice to patrol advises to \u201cUSE CAUTION IF RESPONDING\u201d to Card\u2019s residence due to his \u201cPARANOID BEHAVIOR\u201d and that he has \u201c10-15 FIREARMS\u201d in his house and/or truck. \u201cI learned from [Card\u2019s son] that his father's mental health is in question. [Card\u2019s son] told me that back around January, he noticed his father was starting to claim that people were saying things about him, while out in public,\u201d Carleton wrote. In public, Card\u2019s son said his father would \u201cstart to claim that people around them were talking about him\u201d even when nowhere nearby, and saying nothing in his direction. Card\u2019s son concluded his father was \u201clikely hearing voices or starting to experience paranoia,\u201d a \u201cre-occurring theme\u201d as Card claimed derogatory things were being said about him, \u201csuch as calling him a pedophile,\u201d Carleton wrote. That paranoia and anger would be turned towards his own family, [Card\u2019s son] recounting that in April he had visited his father and Card \u201cbecame very angry, accusing him of saying things about him behind his back,\u201d In the aftermath of the carnage that rocked rural Maine last week a portrait of who Robert Card was is now coming into fuller public view \u2013 though the documents show that worrisome warnings had already been communicated to law enforcement for months. \u201cRobert is currently an Army Reservist assigned to a training unit in Saco and has historically instructed soldier's on the use of hand grenades,\u201d Carleton learns from Card\u2019s son and ex-wife, according to the May incident report. \u201cCara said she is very worried about [their son] spending time with Robert, considering what may be a deteriorating mental health condition,\u201d Carleton wrote. \u201cCara also told me that Robert had recently picked up 10-15 handguns/rifles that had previously been stored at his brother Ryan Card's house. [His son] said the majority of the guns are locked up in Robert's bedroom but added he may have one in his truck. [Card\u2019s son] denied that Robert has done anything threatening with the guns, but is concerned that his father has them.\u201d Though the Card family was \u201caware of Robert's deteriorating mental health,\u201d mother and son told investigators all mitigating efforts \u201chave been in vain as Robert is in denial,\u201d Officer Carleton recounted, and that \u201cRobert has been historically resistant to admitting anything is wrong.\u201d Card\u2019s brother Ryan had not realized he was \u201cbecoming this paranoid or hearing voices,\u201d but that during episodes of \u201cheavy drinking\u201d he would make \u201cangry rants about having to shoot someone,\u201d Card\u2019s ex-wife said, according to the May incident report. Card\u2019s brother was also \u201cnot aware Robert had picked up his guns and was concerned over this,\u201d Carleton recounts from a conversation they had, the May incident report said. According to the May incident report, Card\u2019s brother told investigators he believed the paranoia and anger began when Card got hearing aids for the first time, in February, which Sagadahoc County Deputy Carleton says from his research could possibly be part of the constellation \u2013 but also could be a coincidence. Card\u2019s ex-wife and son \u201cboth don't want Robert to know they are bringing this information forward to law enforcement, for fear it will aggravate the situation,\u201d Carleton\u2019s May report said \u2013 that for the time being they were \u201csimply going to try and avoid contact\u201d and that \u201ceveryone agreed\u201d the \u201cbest avenue of getting Robert some help\u201d might be to contact Card\u2019s command in the Army Reserves. After speaking with the family, Deputy Carleton reached out to Card\u2019s Army Reserves battalion in Saco \u2013 who in turn informed him \u201cthere has recently been considerable concern for Robert.\u201d \u201cIt sounded like they may be aware of his recent mental health decline,\u201d Deputy Carleton wrote in the May incident report. Carleton was told that Card \u201chad been accusing other soldiers of calling him a sex offender which seems to coincide with some of the behavior [Card\u2019s son] has witnessed,\u201d he writes, but that the full extent of the issue may not have been known. \u201cFirst Sgt. Mote said he had no idea the problem is perhaps as bad as (Card\u2019s son) is now describing. He thanked me for the notification because they are scheduled for an upcoming training exercise involving crew served weapons and grenades,\u201d Carleton wrote in the May incident report. Brewing paranoia sours to aggression According to sheriff\u2019s department incident reports Card\u2019s concerns over being labeled a pedophile boiled over this summer. In July, while on a beer run with fellow soldiers, Card accused them of calling him a pedophile and even questioning the size of his manhood, then got into a physical confrontation one soldier described as a \u201clongtime friend,\u201d shoving him, the letter from Card\u2019s army reserve unit to the sheriff\u2019s office says. An email from a member of Card\u2019s army reserve unit to the sheriff\u2019s office says that incident led to Card being evaluated by an Army psychologist who determined he needed further treatment. According to the email Card was taken to Four Winds Psychiatric Hospital in Katonah, NY for treatment and evaluation in mid-July and was released after 14 days. Documents from the sheriff\u2019s office show in early September the Army Reserve requested a health and welfare check for Card, after a reserve soldier expressed concern that Card was going to commit a mass shooting. The soldier says he was in the car with Card when Card started talking about shooting up places and punched him. \u201cAccording to Hodgson, Card said he has guns and is going to shoot up the drill center at Saco and other places. He also said he was going to get \u2018them.\u2019 Since the commander and I are the ones who had him committed we are the \u2018them.\u2019 He also said I was the reason he can't buy guns anymore because of the commitment. Hodgson is concerned that Card is going to snap and commit a mass shooting,\u201d the email\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Family Feud Turns Violent: Gunfire Erupts at Orlando Home\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: ORLANDO, Fla. - A peaceful neighborhood was shattered by violence when a domestic dispute turned deadly in an Orlando home. Details on the Shooting Incident Monday morning saw a terrifying episode unfold on Fitzgerald Drive, near the bustling S. John Young Parkway. Authorities responded swiftly to a distress call, discovering a man and a woman with gunshot wounds. Both were immediately transported to the Orlando Regional Medical Center to attend to their injuries. The events leading to the violent altercation, according to Orlando Police, appear to have stemmed from a \"family altercation\" that escalated tragically. An Insider's Heartbreaking Account Pastor Stovelleo Stovall, familiar with the house where the grim incident unfolded, revealed to reporters that it was, in fact, his childhood home. The shocking revelation was that the alleged shooter was one of his own family members. Shaken by the traumatic event, Pastor Stovall described the chilling moment, saying, \"This man turned around with a gun while everybody was in the house \u2013 my wife, my sister, people helping us clean the house up \u2013 and just went to shooting.\" Disrespecting a Cherished Memory To make matters even more painful, Pastor Stovall shared that the house had recently been the venue of a family event, a solemn gathering to remember his late mother whom they buried this past Saturday. The alleged shooter, having been raised by the departed matriarch, disheartened the pastor with this extreme act of violence. The shocking incident, he felt, was a grave dishonor to his mother's memory. Reports further elucidated the condition of the victims. While Pastor Stovall's sister underwent surgery for an injury to her upper arm, another relative confirmed that her nephew, the male victim, had been grazed in the head. Despite the scare, he is expected to recover fully. In a deeply poignant reflection on the devastating turn of events, Pastor Stovall lamented, \"He done just destroyed the family that\u2019s done the most for him, in the wink of an eye.\" Awaiting Further Updates As of now, the Orlando Police Department has retained discretion on the suspect's identity, promising updates as investigations progress. The incident underscores the unpredictable and destructive nature of domestic altercations and their potential to tear families apart. Source: Fox35orlando.com Did this story resonate?

Jamaica was hit with a 5.4 magnitude on Monday (October 30) that caused panic throughout the country as people fled for safety, CBS Miami reports. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred about 2 miles west-northwest of Hope Bay at a shallow depth of 6 miles. The earthquake hit the U.N.'s International Seabed Authority that was on Monday. After everyone was safe, it was decided to postpone the session. \"We need some time to adjust emotionally,\" said Elza Moreira Marcelino de Castro, who represented Brazil at the meeting. An anonymous journalist was on camera when he felt the reverberations of the earthquake and shared his experience in an interview. \"We're having an earthquake,\" he said while the lights flickered. \"Oh, God,\" he said as he sought shelter under a desk. Following the unexpected incident, Prime Minister Andrew Holnessannounced that no deaths, injuries, or severe damage had been reported as a result of the quake. \u201cDamage has been minor, but nevertheless, we are taking all precautions,\u201d Holnes said in a message online. \u201cI want to say to all Jamaicans, remain calm.\u201d The prime minister implored the people to find shelter and safety saying that many areas are without electricity and phone service because of the earthquake. \u201cWe give God thanks for sparing us the worst,\u201d Holness said.

Keep in mind that Long Valley Caldera in California has been under the watchful eye of volcanologists, seismologists, and geologists for decades. While volcanic eruptions are unpredictable, they do typically occur in similar patterns. A volcano\u2019s sleeping phase indicates a volcano\u2019s dormancy before it wakes up and erupts. There is no telling how long a volcano may be dormant; it may be days, or it may be decades. A study published by National Geographic, however, says that the dormancy period of a volcano is typically shorter in cases where the magma chamber below is active \u2013 which is the case for Long Valley Caldera. Long Valley Caldera last erupted over 100,000 years ago. Then, from 1978 until 2004, it began to display periods of unrest, which has raised concerns about the next big eruption. Presently, there are more than 625 cubic miles of magma bubbling up belowground at Long Valley Caldera. Recently, activity at Long Valley Caldera has begun intensifying. CIT\u2019s study suggests that the maga is boiling underground presently, and pressure is beginning to build up. Since the magma chamber 12 meters underground has filled, this is drastically affecting the height and overall appearance of the Long Valley Caldera. Periods of regular seismicity (earthquakes) have altered the elevation of Long Valley Caldera dramatically, which gives proof that the magma below ground is brewing and that the volcano was preparing for its next eruption. The earthquakes mentioned here occurred within the vicinity of Long Valley Caldera over the last week and have been examined closely by USGS, CalTech, EarthquakeTrack, Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, and Alaska Earthquake Observatory \u2013 all credible and globally recognized seismic activity monitoring systems.

Lunenburg was looking to win their fifth straight in the series and take a 9-1 record into the Region 2A playoffs as the top seed. Instead, they will be 8-2 and may have to play the region title game, if they get there, on the road. \u201cThree turnovers didn\u2019t help with two interceptions and a fumble. We haven\u2019t been turning the ball over and take pride in that. Nonetheless, it happened. Hat\u2019s off to Amelia, though. They played well and made the plays,\u201d said Lunenburg coach Will Thomas. \u201cThey put a little stress on us defensively that we hadn\u2019t seen. We still had well over 300 yards of offense. We\u2019re just having a hard time stopping anybody, which is crazy because we only gave up 13 against Buckingham, the best team that we played. We gave up run plays, pass plays and we\u2019re not very good right now on that side of the ball.\u201d The Chargers led 13-0 in the first half, but Amelia rallied to grab a 14-13 advantage by half-time. However, Central High\u2019s ground attack \u2013 which churned out 366 yards \u2013 enabled them to take a 21-20 fourth quarter lead following a touchdown and successful two-point conversion. Another splendid rushing performance was turned in by senior two-way star Connor Mattox, who ran for 231 yards and a touchdown on 30 attempts. It puts Mattox over 1400 yards on the campaign. Last chance for Central High falls short With 35 seconds to go, Amelia re-claimed the lead. Tony Jones returned the ensuing kickoff to about the 20-yard line of the Raiders. As time expired, Lunenburg\u2019s final pass play in the red zone fell incomplete. In the latest power ratings, Lunenburg is No. 2 in Region 2A at 22.3, just barely ahead of Amelia 21.89 and trailing top-seeded Poquoson (24.22). Unless Amelia beats Buckingham, the Chargers will be the No. 2 seed in the opening round and likely draw a first round opponent of Southampton, who\u2019s currently 4-5 overall. Even as frustrating as the loss was for Lunenburg, their goals do not change. They\u2019re aiming to be the last team standing in Region 2A, no matter who they end up seeing in the playoffs. \u201cTo me, a regional runner-up doesn\u2019t mean as much to the rest of our staff. We\u2019d like to win a region championship. You have to be a good football team to do that, and right now we\u2019re not a consistently good football team,\u201d noted Thomas. \u201cUp until a minute and a half to go, it was looking good and like we might get out of there. You can have a bad game, but you better find a way to win it. We\u2019ve been able to do that most of the time all\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Whether you're leaving your home or hunkering down for the storm, these tips can help you make sure you and your furry friend are secure ahead of ferocious weather. Make sure your records are up-to-date. Vaccination papers, medical records, and identification tags are included. Have copies of this information and keep them in waterproof containers. As for your pet's tags, ensure the information is secured on their collar. Micro-chipping, pet trackers, and GPS collars also come in handy, if not already done. Never leave your pet alone or outside. Always bring your pets inside during a severe weather event. They could be exposed to structural damage, flooding, and other dangers when a hurricane sweeps through. This is the same case if they're left alone at home during a hurricane. Always make sure you have a carrier or leash with you, as well. Introduce your pet to a shelter room. If you have a room dedicated to sheltering yourself against severe weather, try and get your pet acquainted in this space. It can range from bathrooms and closets to basements. Have them eat food and water to get comfortable and even sleep here so they feel more comfortable. If you have no other options, you go to a pet-friendly shelter or location that can brave the storm. Prepare a disaster kit for your pet. If you have a hurricane kit ready, you should have one for your pet, too. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources, the kit should include a two-week supply of food, water, and medication for each animal, as well as their up-to-date veterinary records, photos of your pet, registration, and contact information of friends and family. It also includes instructions for the food and medication, non-spill dishes, blankets, and first aid. What about my fish? If you have an at-home aquarium, experts recommend you purchase a battery-powered oxygen pump and extra batteries so your fish can survive for up to 48 hours after a power outage. If power isn't restored for days, rent or borrow a generator. Temperature regulation is also important, and Something Fishy has tips for that.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Tropical depression or storm may form Sunday near Bahamas; Tammy fades\ndate: 2023-10-29\nbody: A short-lived tropical depression or potentially a short-lived Tropical Storm Vince could develop near the Bahamas on Sunday, one of two disturbances the National Hurricane Center is tracking. The system located east of the southeastern Bahamas early Sunday was expected to move west-northwest. As of 8 a.m. Sunday, it was given a 70% chance of developing. However, dry air and strong upper-level winds on Monday should prevent further development, according to the hurricane center. Meanwhile, an area of low pressure may form in the central or southwestern Caribbean this week. It was given a 20% chance of developing further in the next seven days as it moves west, the latest advisory stated. By Sunday, Tropical Storm Tammy was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, no longer being formally tracked by the National Hurricane Center. It was located 610 miles east of Bermuda, with tropical-storm force winds extending out 90 miles from its center. Tammy\u2019s maximum sustained winds had dropped to 40 mph and it is forecast to continue weakening until it dissipates in a few days. Tammy made landfall on Barbuda on Oct. 21, then lashed the Leeward Islands. The hurricane swiped the far eastern Caribbean two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe dumped 6 to 8 inches of rain over Antigua and Barbuda and knocked out electricity there, according to the Associated Press. So far this season in the Atlantic, there have been 19 named storms, seven of which were hurricanes . Of those, three were major hurricanes, meaning Category 3 or above. Those were Hurricane Lee, a rare Category 5; Hurricane Franklin, a Category 4; and Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall on Florida\u2019s Big Bend region at Category 3 strength on Aug. 30. The remaining storm names for 2023 are Vince and Whitney. If all those names end up being used this season, the National Hurricane Center would turn to the supplemental list of names from the World Meteorological Association. In previous years, the Greek alphabet was used for additional storm names \u2014 which had only happened twice before \u2014 during the record-shattering hurricane seasons in 2005 and 2020.

Here\u2019s the total impact on SC from Idalia\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Nearly two months since Tropical Storm Idalia chugged along South Carolina\u2019s coast, the National Weather Service published a review of the storm\u2019s impact to the Palmetto State. On Aug. 30, Idalia swirled from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane, weakening as it moved up through southeast Georgia and reached southeast South Carolina as a tropical storm. It then exited into the Atlantic, south of Myrtle Beach. Idalia brought tropical storm-force winds and heavy rains to the state, causing damaging flooding, storm surge and a few tornadoes. It forced the closure of schools and businesses, and set off a chain reaction of cities and towns issuing state of emergency declarations. Over 350 incident reports from Idalia were called in between southeast Georgia and South Carolina, detailing downed power lines, hour-by-hour rain counts, whipping winds, felled trees and impassable roads. Idalia\u2019s greatest weapon was storm surge. Coinciding with a rare supermoon , the evening\u2019s high tide was already set to be higher-than-normal. In the Lowcountry, many tide gauge locations showed 2-3 feet of inundation. The Charleston Harbor gauge clocked nearly 3.5 feet of inundation, with the total tide at 9.23 feet. According to the NWS, it\u2019s the fifth-highest value on record dating back over 100 years. Storm surge flooding flowed into the Gay Fish Company on St. Helena Island and in Geechie Seafood in Mount Pleasant. Water that covered roads and parking lots in Folly Beach, Seabrook Island and McClellanville was so deep in some areas, that demarcation lines blurred and road access was cut off. In Downtown Charleston, flooding rose above car tires and washed crashed over the High Battery sea wall. While Georgia got the bulk of river flooding, the Edisto River near Givhans Ferry peaked at over 14 feet. The storm chewed away at the state\u2019s coastline. Dunes on the Isle of Palms, Hunting Island, and Edisto and Folly beaches were eroded by several feet in some places. Strong waves breached the dunes at Edisto Beach, causing water to surge onto Palmetto Boulevard. On Hunting Island, its south beach lost between 5 and 7 feet of dune . Tropical storm force winds ripped through the coast, downing trees and power lines. Beaufort recording the fastest wind speed at 66 mph, according to reports uploaded by the NWS. Mount Pleasant, and Daniel and Hilton Head islands registered the lowest wind speed at 30 mph. Four confirmed tornadoes touched down, with three falling under the EF-0 rating. The other tornado, in Berkeley County south of Eccles Church Road, over Muddy Creek, caused EF-1 damage. The Berkeley County twister snapped and uprooted several large hard and softwood trees, the NWS said. The EF Scale is used to assign a tornado a \u2018rating\u2019 based on estimated wind speeds and related damage There is still a little over a month left of Atlantic hurricane season. If another storm forms, it would be named Vince.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Tammy redevelops into tropical storm; forecasters watch another system in Caribbean Sea\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: The storm system that had been Hurricane Tammy redeveloped into a tropical storm Friday morning, a day after it was downgraded to a strong post-tropical cyclone. Tropical Storm Tammy is forecast to bring wind gusts and heavy rain to Bermuda for the next few days, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday night. Swells could affect the northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. As of 11 a.m. Friday, Tammy was located about 215 miles east of Bermuda, moving northwest at 3 mph. It is expected to turn north tonight, then to the east in coming days, beginning to move away from Bermuda Saturday morning. Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph, and the storm\u2019s strength is not expected to change much over the next day or so. Afterwards, the storm is expected to gradually weaken, forecasters say, becoming a depression in five days or sooner. Tammy made landfall on Barbuda on Oct. 21, then lashed the Leeward Islands. The hurricane swiped the far eastern Caribbean two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe dumped 6 to 8 inches of rain over Antigua and Barbuda and knocked out electricity there, according to the Associated Press. Tammy had weakened into a post-tropical cyclone early Thursday morning. Forecasters are watching a second area in the Atlantic for potential tropical development as of Friday afternoon, in the western Caribbean Sea. A broad area of low pressure is expected to form there in the coming days, and it could slowly develop early next week while moving north. As of 2 p.m., it has a 30% chance of developing in the next seven days, the National Hurricane Center said, a slight increase from 20% the night before. So far this season in the Atlantic, there have been 19 named storms, seven of which were hurricanes. Of those, three were major hurricanes, meaning Category 3 or above.

On Aug. 20, remnants from Hilary dropped about a year\u2019s worth of rain for the park in just one day. The rainwater flowed into nearly every basin in the park, forming ephemeral lakes. \"The most notable one is the one at Badwater Basin,\" said Matthew Lamar, park ranger at Death Valley National Park. He noted that Badwater Basin, a salt flat that is 282 feet below sea level and as far as the eye can see, is the lowest point in North America. Photos taken last weekend and earlier this week showed just how much rainwater remained in the usually dry Badwater Basin, which has turned the salt flat into an expansive reflecting pool. The basin filled with about 2 feet of water soon after the storm. The last time a similar lake formed at Death Valley was in 2005, when another major rain event occurred, according to Lamar. DEATH VALLEY FLOODED BY REMNANTS OF HURRICANE HILARY \"The event we experienced in August was one of these dynamic events that has helped to shape Death Valley,\" Lamar said. \"Some of those impacts will last for years and some, like the lake, will maybe only last for weeks or months.\" The current depth of the lake in Badwater Basin stands at about a couple inches, but the view is still impressive, he said. Park officials are unsure about how much longer the lake will last, but Lamar believes visitors will still be able to view the transformed Badwater Basin at least through next week and the weekend. In addition to the temporary lakes, the August storm also caused the desert park to become greener than usual for this time of year. HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER \"It's a really special thing,\" Lamar said. \"If people have the ability to come out and experience those changes, even the temporary ones, it truly is special.\"\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Ephemeral Beauty: Death Valley Gleams With Color Upon Reopening After Hurricane Hilary\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Those who are fortunate to visit Death Valley in the very near future might be able to experience an incredibly rare sight: a lake and flowers in the middle of a desert. The National Park reopened last week after being closed for two months after the remnants of Hurricane Hilary passed over it. The storm, at one point a potent Category 4 hurricane, dumped a record-breaking year's worth of rain on the desert in just one day. Every road in the park was damaged, washed out or covered by mud from the massive flash flooding. Ephemeral beauty Following the floods, some amazing things happened. Visitors and park rangers reported that shallow ponds and lakes had formed in the lowest-lying areas of the park and between sand dunes. Around them, out-of-season wildflowers bloomed. At Badwater Basin, a stunning transformation has occurred. The basin, which covers nearly 200 square miles, was once home to an ancient lake that dried up tens of thousands of years ago. The famous salt flats are the lowest and hottest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level and with summer daytime highs of 110 degrees or more. But now a portion of these flats, which usually showcase impressive salt formations, are covered by an ephemeral lake. Ephemeral lakes, also called \"intermittent lakes,\" occur when large amounts of precipitation fall in an area where there is no way for the water to leave. Badwater Basin is one such area and has seen ephemeral lakes in the past, notably in 2005 and 2019. The current lake in Badwater Basin formed after Hilary delivered over two inches of rain on August 20. Death Valley has never received that much rain in a single day since records have been kept. The lake is believed to be about two feet deep and stretches several miles along the desert floor. But it's fading fast The lake and wildflowers emerged as if by magic from the arid desert floor, transforming the barren land into a shimmering oasis. But their ephemeral beauty is fleeting. The flowers are already a bit harder to find. The lake at Badwater Basin is still there, partly because daily temperatures are no longer in the 110s. Therefore, evaporation occurs more slowly. Soon enough, this enigmatic wonder will disappear completely. Just as quickly as it materialized, it will vanish, leaving little to no trace of its existence. * * * * * Read more: 'I've never seen anything like this': Death Valley gleams with water, wildflowers and color (msn.com) Rare lakes form in Death Valley after historic rainfall | The Sacramento Bee (sacbee.com) Death Valley visitors delight in rare ephemeral lakes left behind by storm | National parks | The Guardian Death Valley is an oasis of lakes and wildflowers after Hurricane Hilary | CNN\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Hurri-quake?

We are an NPR station. In August, our region was hit by the first every tropical storm to make it to our region. Then, just as the storm was arriving, we had a magnituide 5.1 earthquake, followed by a series of aftershocks.

President Joe Biden today released his much-awaited executive order on the subject of AI. The headlines are justifiably about the order\u2019s safety and security aspects (we have a story up on that here), but there\u2019s also a fair amount in there about privacy and other civil liberties. The U.S. lacks a comprehensive federal privacy law, with existing rules relating narrowly to either children (COPPA) or health information (HIPAA). Biden clearly doesn\u2019t like this\u2014in his State of the Union earlier this year, he identified data privacy as a rare opportunity for bipartisan legislation, mostly with a focus on protecting under-18s, but also featuring \u201cstricter limits on the personal data that companies collect on all of us.\u201d Now the president is using AI-related risks to bolster his case and slowly move towards action. From today\u2019s White House statement: \u201cAI not only makes it easier to extract, identify, and exploit personal data, but it also heightens incentives to do so because companies use data to train AI systems.\u201d \u201cTo better protect Americans\u2019 privacy, including from the risks posed by AI, the President calls on Congress to pass bipartisan data privacy legislation to protect all Americans, especially kids,\u201d the statement continued. A plea to a broken Congress is one thing, but Biden also directed a slew of actions around \u201cprivacy-preserving\u201d technologies and techniques. There\u2019s now going to be more federal support for their development, and federal agencies will be encouraged to use them, with guidelines being established to evaluate their effectiveness. There will also be an evaluation of how government agencies buy personally identifiable data from commercial sources such as data brokers and new guidance about avoiding \u201cAI risks\u201d when using it. Biden\u2019s White House has previously laid out concerns about AI and data privacy\u2014a whole section in last November\u2019s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is devoted to it\u2014but now it\u2019s actually starting to do something about the issue. The bar may be low, but I\u2019ve never seen a U.S. administration being so proactive on privacy, and I\u2019m intrigued to see whether this momentum can be maintained or even hopefully increased. Biden\u2019s AI order is also proactive on other fronts, in ways that ought to help tackle both longer-term and more immediate risks. Among other things, federal agencies will have to: develop AI safety and security standards\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Biden\u2019s new executive order marks another inflection point for AI and data privacy\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: Describing artificial intelligence as the \u201cmost consequential technology of our time,\u201d President Joe Biden signed a new executive order yesterday to guide responsible AI development and guard against risks. A milestone for AI policy in the U.S., the new EO covers a wide array of issues with broad implications for government agencies, businesses and consumers. Using the Defense Production Act, the sweeping order addresses a range of concerns including data privacy, cyber attacks, disinformation and national security. It also directs federal agencies to explore AI\u2019s potential implications for civil rights, health care, innovation, competition, education and the economy. In a speech Monday afternoon, Biden listed a range of ways AI has the potential to both help and harm \u2014 and even joked about watching an AI deepfake of himself that made him think, \u201cWhen the hell did I say that?\u201d \u201cOne thing is clear,\u201d Biden said before signing the executive order. \u201cTo realize the promise of AI and avoid the risk we need to govern this technology.

But now there's finally a way to turn off Facebook and Instagram's tracking all in one place. The new Activity Off-Meta Technologies tool, previously known as Off-Facebook Activity, lets you see and control data that apps and websites share with the platforms -- and monitor the kind of information third-party apps can access. With the privacy feature, you can clear the history of apps and websites that have shared your data. You can also disconnect any information Meta has shared from your account. Or you can selectively choose which companies you want to stop sharing your activity with, and it'll stop showing those targeted ads. Here's how to get a better grip on your Facebook and Instagram privacy. How to manage what sites share with Facebook and Instagram using the Activity Off-Meta Technologies tool Using Meta's business tools, you can see what information apps and websites have sent to the company. From there, you can clear the information from your account and turn off future tracking from your account. You'll be able to control this for all apps and websites so they'll no longer be able to share your search activity with Facebook or Instagram. To get started on Facebook, go to Settings & Privacy > Settings > Off-Facebook Activity. From there, you can manage your Off-Facebook Activity, clear all history and disconnect any future activity on your account. On Instagram, click on your profile button and select the stacked three lines in the top right. Then, go to Settings and privacy > Accounts Center > Your information and permissions > Your activity off Meta technologies. From here, you can disconnect specific activity, clear activity and manage future activity. What happens when you turn off Activity Off-Meta Technologies Once you clear the activity managed by the tool, Facebook and Instagram will remove your identifying information that the apps and websites share. That means the Meta apps won't know which websites you visited or what you looked at, so you won't see targeted ads from those sites. What else you can do to improve your privacy on Facebook and Instagram If you'd like to control which ads you see (or don't) on Facebook, go to your Settings on your phone or desktop and select the Meta Accounts Center, then tap on Ad preferences. Here, you can see recent ad activity, advertisers you've seen, ad topics and ad settings. Note that you can access your Instagram settings from Facebook, too. Under Advertisers You've Seen Most Recently, you can see which advertisers have\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: 5 Reasons You Should Stop Using Facebook Right Now\ndate: 2023-10-18\nbody: Facebook has as many as 2.9 billion monthly active users worldwide, and is constantly making the news for scandals and social issues related to its platform. Though it started out as a way to keep in touch with people, it's now used to keep track of everything that happens in and outside of your social circle, keep up with the news, buy products, and consume various types of media. It's become an activity that people can spend hours on every day, with the average adult in the UK investing 16 hours a week on Facebook. But is Facebook really worth your time? Depending on what you use it for and how it affects other aspects of your life, it could be a good idea to simply quit. Let's look through a few of the compelling issues that affect some users and evaluate whether using Facebook is a net positive for you. 1. It collects too much data Everyone knows that Facebook collects user data and that there are countless scandals around how they do it and what they use it for. It's been in the news so much in recent years that it feels too normal to even be shocking. The normalization of this data-collecting practice, however, is quite dangerous, and it's important to remember just how much information Facebook collects. If you look at the privacy details for the Facebook app on the Apple App Store, there's a list of data types the app collects. It includes contact information, purchase history, financial information, location, contacts, photos and videos on user devices, search history, browsing history, health and fitness information, and audio data on user devices. It also includes data types labeled \"sensitive information\" and \"other data types,\" showing that this already long list is not exhaustive. The dangers of corporations collecting data like this are varied. For example, when Meta sells your data, it increases the chances of your information being exposed in breaches. While there are privacy settings you can change, and users who don't mind that their data is being mined, the fact is that you're selling important personal information that makes the Meta company a lot of money. At the very least, you should receive something positive in exchange for this data \u2014 but, as the rest of this article will argue, using Facebook often doesn't result in many benefits. 2. Its content is too negative Another all-too-familiar topic when it comes to Facebook is the potential danger of its algorithms. These machine learning algorithms feed on your data, using who you are, what you liked, what you clicked on, what you bought, who you know, and many other factors to determine what to show you. Their goals are to find the ads you're most likely to click on so advert\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

The 43-year-old had been dealing with complications and kidney failure since 2011 after she received surgery at the hands of cosmetic surgeon An\u00edbal Lotocki . Her lawyer, Fernando Burlando , confirmed the news on social media. The statement comes two weeks after Mariano Caprarola , who was also his patient, died of acute kidney failure. \u201cAn ending that hurts; a pity and unworthy. Hopefully Silvina\u2019s fight will help the Justice take notice as well society and there will be no more deaths. I hug her family who never gave up and who, like Silvina, kept their guard up. God save you, dear Silvina Luna,\u201d Burlando stated. Luna died waiting for a kidney transplant in an Italian hospital. She had been sharing her journey with dialysis on social media until her last post, on June 5th. She reportedly spent the last 79 days in the ICU and contracted Covid during her hospital stay. Burlando said that Luna had been \u201cbattling for her life,\u201d and they made the difficult decision to disconnect her from life support.

Luna became a public name after she was a participant on Big Brother 2 in 2001. With dreams of becoming a model and actress, she decided to undergo cosmetic surgery in 2011, which is believed to be the source of her health problems. She had a procedure done to her buttox, and Lotocki, Luna\u2019s cosmetic surgeon, injected her with polymethylmethacrylate, a synthetic polymer that is a type of plastic. It\u2019s often used as a substitute for glass because of its similar optical properties in automotive parts, transparent sheets and panels, optical lenses and eyeglasses, aquariums, and more. Needless to say, it should not be injected with this type of procedure. Burlando said the treatment was tantamount to \u201cputting stones and sand in an engine that needs lubrication.\u201d In 2015 she was hospitalized with kidney stones, and Luna was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and hypercalcemia and was prescribed a dialysis treatment three times per week until she could receive a new kidney.

Gambon brought a steely edge to the role, one that would neatly fit the remainder of the franchise, which grew darker and showed Dumbledore as a more complex character.

The vibe of Sol y Luna is lush tropical Peruvian bush throughout. Think Marrakech\u2019s Jardin Majorelle meets a touch of curated South American technicolor swagger. A kind of manicured mirage, if you will. Palms, cacti and a profusion of kaleidoscopic flowers spring up at every corner of the Relais & Chateaux resort with bees buzzing, butterflies fluttering and birds chirping over its stone clad casitas, or \u201clittle houses\u201d day and night. All set within the confines of a very private slip road, dead centre in the Sacred Valley, the appeal of Sol y Luna is that it\u2019s all very hush, hush and is suited to well-heeled type travellers whose definition of trekking up to Machu Picchu is their own version of hell. At surface level Sol y Luna\u2019s gratuitous luxury looks much the same as every other swish pad on the planet but look beyond its polished floors and fancy starlit pool and you\u2019ll soon learn it\u2019s a hotel with an inspiring story that tugs the heartstrings. Founder and owner of the hotel Petit Miribel built the resort to help fund local projects and support communities. Over the years, the successes grew, and the hotelier quickly learned that the best way she could best help the people of Urubamba (the hotel\u2019s home) would be to build a school, and so the Sol y Luna foundation was born. There are four main branches. The first is an Intercultural school; the second the Paqari School for children with special needs; the Sol y Luna home which provides a safe haven for children who have been the victims of violence, maltreatment and abuse; and the Sol y Luna school recently set up to help support students once they have graduated. Post pandemic, much of it is funded now by guests who stay at the hotel who, after requesting visits to the nearby foundation, donate to a school of their choosing. Sure, it\u2019s beautiful and Andean to a tee, but the joy of staying at Sol y Luna is, without doubt, the fact that your bucks go straight to a cause that instantly goes back into supporting the locals and traditions that make this part of the world so special. It is, best summed up, as a luxe hotel doing good.

Cherelyn Gesalan, 50, is cooking the Filipino staple, taking pictures for me as she goes. \u201cI only use Datu Puti soy sauce and vinegar, no other brand,\u201d she tells me, referencing the condiment manufacturer that is a household name in the Philippines. Cherry, as her friends and family call her, has lived and worked outside of her home country since 1997. She isn't a chef, but cooking is something of a coping mechanism whenever she feels homesick, and Cherry banks on the nostalgic charm of her favourite Filipino dishes. But her proclivity towards familiar flavours has also been serving a different purpose. Cultural exchange The fragrant adobo she's preparing is a regular addition to the school lunch boxes of Nacho, six, and Luna, four, and \u201cit has always been like that\u201d, declares Cherry. The two children aren't hers and they aren't even Filipino, but she's been their nanny all their lives. \u201cThey really love Filipino food,\u201d she says. It's not just Nacho and Luna, either; Cherry says their parents, Silvina and Diego Meneghetti, who both work at Emirates, are also fond of South-East Asian cuisine. After six years with the Argentinian-Brazilian family, Cherry has introduced them to an array of Filipino dishes, from the now mainstream adobo and lumpia to more traditional tinola and afritada. Silvina's favourite is ginataang bilo bilo, a coconut milk soup with sticky rice balls and sweet potatoes. Filipino staples aside, every meal Cherry serves to the family is a poignant cultural mishmash, even if some dishes are not intuitive for her. Cherry is just one of tens of thousands of Filipinos who work as domestic helpers in a UAE household. \u201cThe Meneghetti family treat me like their own. They are open-minded and very respectful,\u201d she says. This dynamic is critical in the organic cultural exchange, she says, as Cherry can stay in touch with her roots with no inhibitions while working for and living with them. During birthday parties and gatherings with other non-Filipino guests, Cherry's tray of stir-fried pancit is the culinary star of the show, she says proudly. Perhaps it helps that Filipino culture and cuisine have Hispanic influences, which also span Argentinian and Brazilian societies.

See below for the latest updates. The U.S. rejected accusations by Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West and Ukraine had orchestrated an anti-Israel riot in an airport in the Russian republic of Dagestan over the weekend, calling the allegations \"absurd.\" In a televised meeting, Putin said the West and Ukraine had organized the \"deadly chaos,\" saying it is \"the current ruling elites of the U.S. and their satellites who are the main beneficiaries of world instability.\" John Kirby, spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council, described the claims as \"classic Russian rhetoric\" and said \"the West had nothing to do with this. This is just hate, bigotry and intimidation, pure and simple.\" Ukraine also rejected having any role in the incident \u2014 which saw an angry mob storm the airport in Makhachkala, reportedly looking for passengers arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. Antisemitic slogans were chanted by some of the protesters and a plane was surrounded, with passengers having their documents taken.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said that three drones armed with explosives targeted the power plant on Thursday evening. 26, hitting both the station\u2019s administration building and a warehouse storing nuclear waste. The press service for the Kursk nuclear power plant confirmed the strike on Friday, but told journalists that there had been no significant damage or casualties and that operations were continuing as normal. Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry said that the country\u2019s air defences shot down six Ukrainian drones in the early hours of Saturday, including four in the western Oryol region, and two more over the Tula region, south of Moscow. Ukraine\u2019s air force reported four Iskander cruise missiles over the country\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region Saturday night, three of which were destroyed. The apparent lull in aerial attacks at the start of the weekend follows several weeks of intense fighting close to the key city of Avdiivka, which lies in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin on Saturday that Russia had lost approximately 4,000 troops in Avdiivka, according to Kyiv\u2019s Ministry of Defense. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also said Friday that Russia had lost at least a brigade trying to capture the embattled city, whose location provides Ukrainian forces with artillery advantages over the city of Donetsk and could serve as a launch pad for them to liberate the rest of the region. Weeks of bitter fighting in the region have been costly, mostly for the Russian attackers, analysts say. The bid to overrun Avdiivka has backfired on the Kremlin\u2019s forces, robbing it of troops and heavy equipment that \u201cwill likely undermine Russian offensive capabilities over the long term,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War said. Satellite images show the Russian military lost at least 109 military vehicles, mostly armored fighting vehicles and tanks, near Avdiivika between Oct. 10 and 20, the institute said. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Notable Events of October 30th\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Explore the labyrinth of history as we delve into the events of October 30th.

The Huntsville, Alabama, native was a four-year starter in black and gold and was selected in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft in June. Brown\u2019s first basket, a fourth-quarter transition 3-pointer, was a familiar sight for Missouri fans, who saw Brown knock down 100 triples in his collegiate career, including 51 in the 2022-23 season.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson lead Pelicans past Knicks, 96-87; NBA Scores\ndate: 2023-10-29\nbody: NEW ORLEANS, Oct 29 \u2013 The New Orleans Pelicans, led by the dynamic duo of Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson, handed the New York Knicks their first loss of the season with a 96-87 victory on Saturday night (28). Complete Box Score Here Ingram and Williamson Take Charge Ingram, showcasing an impressive arsenal of mid-range pullups, turnarounds, and fades, scored 26 points. Williamson, who powered his way to the rim with finesse, added 24 points. The pair proved too much for a Knicks team that was playing its second road game in less than 24 hours. \u201cWhen we\u2019re on the court together in the fourth quarter, we kind of give each other that look, like, all right, it\u2019s on us now,\u201d Williamson said. Pelicans coach Willie Green echoed the sentiment, stating, \u201cThey carried us tonight offensively and that\u2019s what they need to do night in and night out.\u201d Zion Williamson\u2019s Comeback Williamson, who missed most of last season due to a hamstring injury, has now scored at least 23 points in each of the Pelicans\u2019 first two games. His ability to hit difficult leaners or one-handed floaters through crowds of defenders electrified the home crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy seeing it in real-time,\u201d Ingram said, marveling at Williamson\u2019s touch around the rim. Knicks Struggle on Back-to-Back Nights RJ Barrett led the Knicks with 18 points, but the team seemed to lose steam in the final quarter, coming off a win in Atlanta the previous night. \u201cWe were a step behind, a step slow,\u201d said Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau. The Knicks were as close as six points late in the third quarter but couldn\u2019t sustain the momentum. Supporting Cast and Stats Jonas Valanciunas sparked a 10-1 run early in the fourth quarter that extended the Pelicans\u2019 lead to 85-69. New Orleans-area native Mitchell Robinson grabbed 15 rebounds for New York, while Julius Randle struggled, missing 11 of his 15 shots. The Knicks will visit Cleveland on Tuesday night, while the Pelicans will host the Golden State Warriors on Monday.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Latest NBA scores, results and recap on Oct. 27\ndate: 2023-10-28\nbody: MIAMI, FL (Oct. 28) \u2014 The latest NBA scores, results and recap on Friday night (27).

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:39AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Netflix's original content releases\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Netflix vs. Disney Plus: How to Pick Which Streaming Service Is Best for You\ndate: 2023-08-17\nbody: We're living in an era where streaming viewership frequently outpaces cable at monthly intervals during throughout the year, demonstrating how much time and money audiences spend on streaming TV. But given the current financial climate, you may have moments when you question whether you need all those streaming platforms. Within the past six months, these services have all changed. Netflix now charges an extra fee to share your account, but removed its $10 plan. Disney Plus is upping prices, adding a new bundle, removing content and has plans to launch an app that merges Hulu and Disney titles. Meanwhile, Max is here with Discovery Plus content, and Peacock and Paramount Plus have also increased their prices. Netflix imposed a price hike 2022, added a cheaper ad-supported plan and bills you $8 for extra users. Amid the cost and password crackdown, some people are considering canceling their subscriptions. Disney Plus provides high-quality content that's on par with Netflix, and its pricing options make it stiff competition. But, how do these two streaming giants compare in content and value? Both services have spawned huge pop-culture hits, as seen with The Mandalorian and 2022's most-streamed show, Stranger Things. Last year, Netflix had the most popular streaming content of the year, according to Nielsen, with Disney Plus snagging a few spots. Both carry family-friendly gems, superhero stories, documentaries and feature films with A-list talent. You may be a longtime Netflix subscriber or only keep Disney Plus for your kids, and you've found a routine with all the streaming platforms you use. However, if you're someone who's weighing costs against which service to keep, here's guidance on how to choose. : Best Streaming Service of 2023 Netflix Netflix can be credited with kicking off the streaming wars back in 2007. Since then, the streaming pioneer has increased its subscription prices, added fees for extra members and launched a cheaper tier with ads. But Netflix continues to lean into originals while providing a range of licensed TV shows and movies. Its interface makes it easy to sift through content based on genre, popularity or age. Read our Netflix review. Disney Plus Disney Plus rises to the top with its family-friendly stable of movies and shows. At $8 a month for the ad-supported version, it's a bargain for anyone\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: New Warning Coming to Certain Netflix, Disney+ Content\ndate: 2023-10-29\nbody: It seems that Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming giants will potentially be adding a new warning to some of their iconic shows and movies. In recent years, the once-unquestioned dominance of Netflix in the world of streaming content has been challenged by the likes of Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. This time last year, it was reported that it had lost nearly a million subscribers, and shareholders were all but revolting against CEO Ted Sarandos. Now, Netflix is showing astronomically higher numbers, including adding nearly six million new subscribers and increasing its free cash flow from approximately $13 million to a staggering $1.3 billion. The streaming platform home of The Witcher, Wednesday, Stranger Things, Squid Game, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Black Mirror turned its fortunes around so abruptly with the recent addition of password crackdowns, much like we are about to see Disney+ do. Netflix has been the most influential streaming platform, originating as a DVD service and now, housing some of the most popular series to ever be created. Netflix has even changed the film industry by making it so that a new movie can be of an award-winning status, but no longer needs a theatrical release, which has been customary for over 50 years. In competition with Netflix, we have Disney+. When subscribers initially signed up for Disney+, they did so that they would have a library of everything Disney at their fingertips. No more would you have to purchase a DVD or find a way to watch your favorite Disney films and shows online, it was all available in one place. Then, to compete with the other big players in the streaming market like Netflix, Disney had to move past their regular content and create Disney+-specific and original content for viewers. With this realization came a massive explosion of content that really helped transform Disney+ into one of the largest streaming services available. We have been able to see the Star Wars universe expand with three award-winning seasons of The Mandalorian, which has constantly broken records, and now, Ahsoka. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) growth for individual storylines and characters has been exponential, with so many series being created to dive deeper into different characters, which will only culminate as one massive storyline within the MCU timeline. The next big release on the Marvel side will be Loki, season two. Although the platform is trying to compete with the likes of Netflix, Amazon\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Netflix Set for Major Content Removals, Other Changes Announced\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Netflix is set to bid farewell to hundreds of titles as several changes are set to come to the platform. One of the standout features of Netflix is its ability to cater to a wide range of tastes. The platform has something for everyone, from riveting crime dramas like Mindhunter to epic fantasy series like The Witcher. Netflix\u2019s original content, in particular, has captured the hearts and attention of viewers worldwide. Shows like Stranger Things, set in the 1980s with supernatural elements and a group of endearing kids as protagonists, have become cultural phenomena, while Bridgerton, a Regency-era period drama, has sparked a new wave of romance series. Netflix\u2019s popular shows aren\u2019t limited to one genre, and that diversity is one of its strengths. Whether you\u2019re into thought-provoking documentaries like Making a Murderer or lighthearted comedies like The Crown, the platform offers an extensive array of choices. The ability to binge-watch entire seasons at one\u2019s own pace has redefined the way people consume television, making it a cornerstone of modern entertainment. As Netflix continues to invest in original content and expand its global reach, it remains a dominant force in the streaming industry, shaping the future of entertainment. Though Netflix remains the most popular streaming platform in the world today, that doesn\u2019t mean that the company hasn\u2019t been faced with its own set of unique challenges. Netflix cracked down on password sharing earlier this year, making it so that subscribers of the standard plan could no longer share their passwords with friends or family outside of their household. In that same time frame, Netflix increased its prices significantly. Now, Netflix\u2019s standard with ads costs $6.99 per month. The standard subscription is $15.49 per month (extra member slots can be added for $7.99 per month), and the premium subscription is $22.99 per month (extra member slots can be added for $7.99 per month). With prices increasing and demand for content at an all-time high, Netflix has had to continuously make decisions on what contracts it keeps in place and what it moves on from. This includes cutting movies and television shows\u2013 which typically get picked up by another streaming company weeks later\u2013 and bringing in new ones. In November 2023, Netflix reportedly bids farewell to a multitude of titles, including beloved classics and more recent add\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: New Netflix Original Movies and Shows Coming in November 2023\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: Netflix is headed into November with a long list of new titles coming to the streaming library. As the streamer continues to stock the final titles from its October 2023 content list, Netflix on Wednesday unveiled its complete list of new arrivals for November 2023 , promising subscribers a total of 74 new and returning Netflix original TV series, films, documentaries, and specials.

Headlining the lineup will be the sixth and final season of The Crown , the streamer's award-winning historical drama about the late Queen Elizabeth II's reign. Other high-profile returning favorites include the second half of Virgin River Season 5 and Selling Sunset Season 7.

On the series front, Netflix will debut Squid Game: The Challenge , the Peter Dinklage-narrated How to Become a Mob Boss , and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off , the animated revival of the popular film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World that brings back the voices from the original movie.

The plot felt semi-relatable to audiences since it took place during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 when a billionaire hosted a murder mystery game at his mansion on a private island in Greece (the latter is obviously why we said \u201csemi-\u201d relatable). 3. \u201cThe Irishman\u201d (2019) It\u2019s hard to go wrong\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

While spending time in Italy, they were caught getting carried away during a Venetian boat ride and were forbidden to board again. Then, they were repeatedly seen in revealing clothes that inspired plenty of people to talk about them. In recent weeks, there has been some concern among the couple's fans due to the lack of news from them. However, celebrity psychic Inbaal Honigman has done a Tarot reading on their behalf and shares that it \"is not an indication of things to come.\" Inbaal concluded that the recent silence between Kanye and Bianca was not an indication of anything to come. According to the Knight of Disks card, which was drawn during their quiet period, the two are making essential plans. She further expressed to The Mirror that the pair has ambitions they would like to fulfill and have \"targets for the next 2-3 years\" as well. To help them on their path, they are engaging with experts and assistants to launch new projects alongside each other. Inbaal predicted that the pair were in a position to create unified fashion lines, explore foreign countries together, or even bring in an adopted child from overseas. She ultimately concluded her expert prognosis by encouraging: \"This enterprising duo has plenty of irons in the fire.\" This week, while consulting Tarot cards, the psychic predicted that this couple would make it to their first wedding anniversary. This comes although they have been embroiled in controversy and had faded from the public eye. With confidence, Ibaal boldly admitted there are still \"concerns.\" In the interview, she further said: \"The Tarot card 'the Emperor' is a symbol of endurance and strength, which shows that they will make it to their first wedding anniversary this December still together,\" she commented. Continuing, she said: \"There are some obstacles in the marriage according to another card titled 'Adjustment'; however, these issues mainly surround legal matters and paperwork; nothing so serious as to stop them from having a successful union.\" \u00a9 2015 MusicTimes.com All rights reserved.

But who exactly is she? Let's delve into the life and background of this intriguing personality. Censori hails from Melbourne, Australia. She's not just any ordinary individual; she's an accomplished architect. Her journey into the world of architecture began in her childhood. Growing up, she felt a strong inclination towards creative pursuits, particularly artistic ones. For Bianca, architecture symbolizes the perfect blend of art and practicality. It's like sculpting on a grand scale, where the earth becomes the canvas. Educational Background & Professional Journey Her passion for design and aesthetics was nurtured during her younger years, thanks to her aunt. This influential figure in her life exposed her to a diverse range of art, film, and architecture, fostering a love for design that Bianca carried into her adult years. Further, Bianca's dedication to her craft led her to pursue higher education in the field. She holds a master's degree in architecture from the prestigious University of Melbourne. Her professional journey saw her collaborating with West as she began working for Yeezy in 2020. Bianca & Kanye: A Blossoming Relationship The relationship between Bianca and West became public knowledge in early January 2023. While there were rumors about their marriage, it was confirmed that they hadn't legally tied the knot when the news first broke. Interestingly, following the news of their potential union, Bianca's Instagram account seemed to have vanished. This move sparked further curiosity among the public and media alike. Kanye's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, also seemed to react to the news of their relationship. She shared cryptic messages on her Instagram, hinting at her feelings and stance on the matter. One of the quotes she shared read, \"Just remember, the black sheep turns into the goat. Keep doing you.\" Another message emphasized the importance of genuine support, stating, \"People who want to see you win, will help you win. Remember that.\" Family & Public Perception Bianca's family has been supportive of her relationship with Kanye. Alyssia Censori, a relative of Bianca, expressed her happiness for the couple. On the other hand, Kardashian's perspective on the relationship seems to be one of understanding. Sources suggest that Kim isn't against their union, as long as Bianca proves to be a positive influence on Kanye. Kim's primary concern appears to be Kanye's well-being and peace. Throughout the first half of 2023, the couple continued to make public appearances, further solidifying their relationship in the public eye. One of their notable outings was a trip to Japan in June. In Conclusion Bianca Censori is more than just a name linked to Kanye West. She's a talented architect with a passion for design and aesthetics. Her relationship with Kanye has brought her into the limelight, but it's essential to recognize and appreciate her for her individual accomplishments and\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Fans React To Kanye West\u2019s Alleged List Of Rules For His Wife Bianca Censori: 'This Is Abuse'\ndate: 2023-10-22\nbody: Kanye West , 46, is used to causing a stir, not just with his comments but also with his behavior. And the alleged treatment of his wife, 28-year-old Australian architect Bianca Censori , is the latest thing to grab the headlines. Kanye and Bianca tied the knot in a private ceremony in December 2022, just one month after West finalized his divorce from Kim Kardashian . The Daily Mail reported that they used a \u201cconfidential marriage license.\u201d According to reports, the \u201cEazy\u201d rapper allegedly has a long list of rules for his wife to follow, including instructing her to \u201cnever speak,\u201d and dictating what she can eat and what she can wear. Of course, everything that has been reported is a rumor and not confirmed, but many people on the internet firmly believe it based on his past behavior. Kanye West's Alleged Rules For Bianca Censori According to the Daily Mail , insiders have claimed that Bianca has \"no mind of her own anymore\" and just \"obeys\" the Yeezy designer because he has allegedly convinced her that they are \"royal.\" \"Kanye has a set of rules for Bianca, which includes never speak and wear what he wants her to wear,\" an insider told the pub. As per the insider, Bianca \"is also required to eat certain food items and to work out even though Kanye doesn\u2019t work out.\" While we don\u2019t know what exactly is on the list of approved and banned foods, we assume that kebabs, ice-cream and watermelon juice are all on the approved list, as the pair have been pictured eating and drinking them in the past few months. Bianca Censori's Friends Say Her Current Behavior Is Very Out Of Character The Daily Mail also reported that Bianca's friends are worried about her and have tried to make her see sense, but she doesn\u2019t want to listen. \"A few of her friends were finally able to reach her but she wasn\u2019t interested in talking, nor was she interested in anyone\u2019s concerns for her,\" an insider, who is apparently a close friend, said. \"She\u2019s shut everyone out and told one of her former friends to '[expletive] off' when they tried to ask if she was okay. She is saying that her friends are just jealous of her stardom.\" Another friend said that Bianca's current behavior is very out of character, claiming: \"Everyone is extremely concerned. This isn't who she is. She is an incredibly outspoken and lively person who is never one to keep her mouth shut.\" They also thought that the \"Praise God\" rapper wanted Bianca to resemble ex-wife Kim Kardashian, adding: \"Kanye is trying to make Bianca into a radicalized version of Kim \u2013 almost like Kim 2.0. The difference is that when Kim was with Kanye he was respected in the fashion world. He has since lost this respect.\" Fan Reactions Naturally, social media had a *lot\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

As we navigate through the intricacies of health systems worldwide, it\u2019s essential to understand which countries are leading the way in providing top-notch healthcare services. In this article, we\u2019ll delve deep into the world\u2019s best healthcare systems, drawing insights from reputable sources and presenting them in a digestible format. The Pinnacle of Healthcare: Top Countries According to the International Citizens Insurance, healthcare systems vary significantly by country and region. The United States, despite its vast resources, ranked 11th. France: A Healthcare Marvel France stands out with its comprehensive healthcare framework, marked by universal access and state-driven initiatives. It boasts one of the world\u2019s premier healthcare systems. The expansion of Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) in 2000 ensured coverage for every citizen. While direct payments for medical consultations are prevalent, a significant portion is typically reimbursed by the state. The World Health Organization\u2019s extensive study places France at the pinnacle, further accentuated by its impressive health outcomes. The nation\u2019s focus on both innovation and accessibility, combined with its stellar cardiovascular mortality rates, sets it apart in the global healthcare arena. Germany: A Medical Powerhouse Germany is universally acknowledged for its top-tier healthcare. The nation\u2019s medical advancements are further bolstered by housing a significant number of the world\u2019s leading medical technology institutions. In pan-European healthcare evaluations, Germany consistently ranks among the top 15 nations. The Commonwealth Fund lauds its accessibility, with its hybrid public-private system ensuring minimal costs and wait times. For a deeper dive into the overall health and well-being of nations, it\u2019s worth exploring which countries are considered the healthiest based on various factors Singapore: Asian Healthcare Gem Singapore clinches a top spot in the World Health Organization\u2019s global evaluation, making it a standout in Asian healthcare. The city-state\u2019s healthcare system is renowned for its efficiency, underpinned by a hybrid financing model. While direct payments are a norm, schemes like MediShield Life, MediSave, and MediFund assist Singaporeans in managing these expenses.

Britain\u2019s beloved but battered National Health Service turns 75\ndate: 2023-07-05\nbody: Britain\u2019s King Charles III, meets staff and patients at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, to celebrate 75 years of the NHS at NHS Lothian, as part of the first Holyrood Week since his coronation, Scotland, Tuesday July 4, 2023. (Jane Barlow/Pool Photo via AP) LONDON (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s unusual to throw a birthday party for a health care system, but that\u2019s exactly what the U.K. did for the National Health Service, a beloved but increasingly creaky institution that turned 75 on Wednesday. The date was marked with charity tea parties, royal visits and a service of thanksgiving at London\u2019s Westminster Abbey complete with hymns and prayers. It was a fitting tribute for an institution that is often likened to Britain\u2019s secular religion \u2014 though one in which some people are losing faith. Backlogs, treatment delays, funding gaps and an unhappy workforce have created an increasingly threadbare and overstretched system. Three respected health think tanks warned Wednesday that the NHS is \u201cin critical condition\u201d and won\u2019t make it to 100 without more money and better long-term planning. \u201cPressures on services are extreme, and public satisfaction is at its lowest since it first began to be tracked 40 years ago,\u201d the King\u2019s Fund, Health Foundation and Nuffield Trust said in an open letter. But, they added, \u201cdespite this, public support for the NHS as an institution is rock solid.\u201d Britain\u2019s affection for what politicians call \u201cour NHS\u201d is striking, and at times puzzling, to outsiders. Dancing nurses pushing children on hospital beds formed a key part of the opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics, to the bemusement of many non-British viewers. Founded in a country determined to build a fairer society out of the ruins of World War II, the NHS provides free health care to citizens and residents, funded through taxation. Its anniversary is also the 75th birthday of Aneira Thomas, the first person born into the new health service, just after midnight on July 5, 1948. \u201cI used to be introduced by my mother as \u2019This is my National Health baby,\u2019\u201d said Thomas, whose parents named her after the country\u2019s postwar health minister, Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, considered the father of the NHS. \u201cAs a child,\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: AMA President Sounds Alarm on National Physician Shortage, Health System in Crisis\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: In a national address yesterday, American Medical Association President Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, M.D., MPH, spotlighted the growing national physician shortage and corresponding health system in crisis. In remarks delivered at the National Press Club, Dr. Ehrenfeld outlined critical strains on physicians, including enormous administrative burdens, burnout, attacks on science, increased consolidation across health care, a broken Medicare payment system, and health crises that worsen each day. Dr. Ehrenfeld enumerated five steps to get us out of this crisis, including specific legislation and solutions from the AMA Recovery Plan for America\u2019s Physicians: Pass meaningful Medicare payment reform; Reduce administrative burdens like the overused, inefficient prior authorization process; Pass bipartisan legislation to expand residency training options, provide greater student loan support, and create smoother pathways for foreign-trained physicians; End the criminalization of health care; and ensure physicians are not punished for taking care of their mental health needs \u201cThe physician shortage that we have long feared \u2013 and warned was on the horizon \u2013 is already here. It\u2019s an urgent crisis \u2026 hitting every corner of this country \u2013 urban and rural \u2013 with the most direct impacting hitting families with high needs and limited means,\u201d Dr. Ehrenfeld said in remarks as prepared for delivery. \u201cImagine walking into an emergency room in your moment of crisis \u2013 in desperate need of a physician\u2019s care \u2013 and finding no one there to take care of you. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re up against. \u201cAnd so while our current physician shortage is already limiting access to care for millions of people, it\u2019s about to get much worse.\u201d The complete text of the speech as prepared for delivery is below. There is an insidious crisis going on in medicine today that is having a profound impact on our ability to care for patients, and yet isn\u2019t receiving the attention it deserves. This crisis is physician burnout. Let me share three quick anecdotes \u2013 all very personal to me \u2013 that illustrate the problem. Two years ago, a dear friend of mine and medical school classmate, an emergency room physician in California who worked tirelessly on the frontlines throughout COVID, took his own life. He was an energetic and loving soul \u2026 a brilliant and caring doctor \u2026 who felt the weight of the pandemic on his shoulders. He struggled to get out from under it.

From next year, they aim to treat some opioid overdose deaths as homicides and charge drug dealers with murder. This policy change is a response to the ongoing opioid crisis affecting many communities nationwide. In other health news, a Riverside County resident has been diagnosed with active tuberculosis. Public health officials have contacted about 150 people from the California Baptist University community who may have had contact with this individual. Tuberculosis is a severe infectious disease that mainly impacts the lungs and can be deadly if not treated properly. The state Department of Justice has revealed in an investigation that only 17% of hospitals have complied with a law mandating racism in medicine training for maternity care staff, more than two years after it came into effect. This training is critical due to the high death rates among Black mothers in the state. Attorney General Rob Bonta highlighted the importance of this training in a press conference. In the healthcare sector, Scripps Health has ended its collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, established in 2016. The San Diego provider had stated that this partnership would allow them to offer optimal cancer treatment. The reason for ending the partnership remains undisclosed. Furthermore, state regulators are looking to discipline another physician involved in treating Elisa Serna before her 2019 death in the Las Colinas women&#8217;s jail in Santee. Finally, the Biden administration is suggesting new requirements for insurers to lower out-of-pocket costs for mental health care and substance use disorder treatment. The insurance industry opposes this, claiming it would increase prices and set unachievable standards. The Biden administration also proposed a solution for the dispute resolution process, which is part of the federal ban on surprise billing. The No Surprises Act has protected patients from out-of-network provider bills for in-network facility care since 2022. However, disputes over care costs between providers and health insurers have increased.Visit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.

Few would disagree with that premise. Innocently, however, there is a profound assertion being made here; EMS serves to function as a member of the healthcare community, not the public safety community. While this assertion might seem obvious when you consider the fundamental nature of the services we provide, it has profound implications and is worthy of careful consideration. The clear articulation of EMS as a branch of the healthcare community as opposed to the public safety community represents a change in thinking that is vital to our industry\u2019s progression. It is reasonable to believe that EMS deserves ample respect, pay and so on. But when juxtaposed against other pillars of the healthcare community (e.g., nursing, respiratory therapy, etc.), it is obvious that those items are sorely lacking. So why does EMS not have those things? It is a question worth exploring. Dare I say it is a question worth answering. As is true in countless other areas, the first step to solving problems involves understanding them. In America, the contemporary model integrates EMS into the public safety system instead of the healthcare system. At the federal level, oversight belongs to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is a branch of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).1 As such, EMS is aligned with public safety instead of healthcare. This is problematic for a few reasons; not the least of which is funding. Under the current model, EMS must compete with other public safety entities for funding, but where most of what EMS does is healthcare-related, there are no significant funding sources. Hence the proliferation of volunteer agencies and for-profit EMS providers.2 This mislabeling of EMS from the top-down paves the way for a myriad of other problems that the industry has imposed on itself. One example would be to note that our close alignment with public safety entities has led to similar educational requirements. Police officers and firefighters often have entry requirements that prioritize practical skills, experience, and dedication over formal education. These roles emphasize the value of hands-on training and the ability to respond effectively to dynamic situations. While formal education may be of some benefit in these roles, these professions certainly do not mandate its acquisition. In contrast, other fields of healthcare (e.g., nursing) mandate that their prospective workers acquire a college\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Electric vehicle sales continue ramping at a record pace. By the end of 2023, global EV sales are expected to surpass 14.5 million units, according to data from CounterPoint Research. Over 2.15 million EVs were sold in the second quarter alone. Legacy automakers and startups alike are fighting for a position in the new electric era. Tesla has maintained its lead, delivering 466,000 EVs in the second quarter, while China\u2019s leading automaker, BYD, closed the gap with 352,000 passenger EV sales. Meanwhile, of Toyota\u2019s 4.15 million vehicles sold globally in the first half of the year, only a fraction (around 0.19%) were fully electric. Several automakers have been caught flat-footed by the rapid transition. Many of them, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, have recently announced plans to accelerate their electrification strategies to turn things around. Toyota revealed several new technologies at a workshop in June, including several straight out of Tesla\u2019s playbook. The automaker gave us a sneak peek of what we can expect during a plant tour, showing off its next-gen EV production line for the first time. Toyota shows off new EV production line technology One of the biggest highlights was its Giga casting technology, a process Tesla introduced at its Fremont factory in 2020. Giga casting involves producing significantly larger aluminum parts to reduce complexity while saving critical resources. Tesla is said to have reduced costs by around 30% using the method. Toyota claims its \u201cwealth of knowledge\u201d about molds enabled it to develop \u201cquick mold replacements.\u201d By doing so, Toyota says it reduced the lead time for changing the mold to around 20 minutes compared to 24 hours. Furthermore, the automaker will use proprietary analysis tech to improve the casting quality, reducing the number of defective parts. Toyota also emphasized its self-propelled EV production lines. The technology was developed using sensor technology from autonomous driving to enable \u201csizable travel at low speeds.\u201d Using self-propelled lines, Toyota can reduce the need for conveyor equipment, a major cost associated with manufacturing. Toyota also introduced a three-part modular structure consisting of the vehicle\u2019s front, center, and rear to enhance work efficiency and further reduce complexity. Facing a labor shortage, the automaker showed off its Vehicle Logistics Robot (VLR), designed to improve vehicle transportation at the finished vehicle yard. Toyota also revealed its EV battery roadmap last week, which includes new EV\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Could Tesla Be in Trouble With This Potentially Game-Changing Electric-Vehicle Development?\ndate: 2023-09-06\nbody: Which company first comes to mind when you think of electric-vehicle (EV) innovation? I suspect many, if not most, people would have the same answer: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) . Elon Musk's company didn't invent the electric car, of course. However, Tesla was a pioneer in showing how EVs could be practical, fast, and stylish. Today, Tesla dominates the U.S. EV market. In the first half of 2023, the company sold close to 300,000 more electric cars than its nearest rival. But could Tesla be in trouble with a potentially game-changing EV development from another automaker? Finding \"the Holy Grail\" Toyota (NYSE: TM) recently announced what could be \"the Holy Grail\" of electric vehicles. The Japanese automaker revealed plans to launch a new battery-powered car with a driving range of over 900 miles and a charging time of only 10 minutes. The key to this game-changing development is Toyota's solid-state battery technology. Solid-state batteries are similar to the lithium-ion batteries currently used in most EVs. Instead of using liquid electrolytes through which lithium ions flow, they use a solid electrolyte. However, solid-state batteries are better than lithium-ion batteries in several ways. They last longer, take less time to charge, and are smaller. They're also less likely to catch on fire. The main problem with solid-state batteries, though, has been they're more expensive to make than lithium-ion ones. Toyota believes that it has achieved a breakthrough that will allow it to manufacture solid-state batteries at a much lower cost. The company stated that it expects to begin mass production of its solid-state battery as soon as 2027. Leaving Tesla behind? Tesla's Model S boasts a driving range of a little over 400 miles. Musk has claimed in the past that the company could extend the range to 600 miles. However, he said that Tesla didn't want to make the trade-offs that would be required to do so, including lower acceleration and poorer handling. Actually driving 400 miles in a Tesla Model S depends on several factors, though, notably including weather conditions. Cold weather can negatively impact the range of lithium-ion batteries.

Between changing cities every night, performing late into the night and long stretches away from home, touring can take a mental and physical toll on musicians. That's why some of the world\u2019s biggest stars admit that they're just not a fan of hitting the road. Despite fans\u2019 desires to see their favorite performers on tour, sometimes it just isn't the best idea. Read on to find out why these stars don't like touring\u2026 1. Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus hasn't embarked on a major headlining tour since 2014 and even though her fans want her to hit the road again, she doesn't see it in her future. She recently explained that while she loves performing, touring is \"not natural\" and is \"isolating because you're in front of 100,000 people then you are alone.\" \"After the last [headline tour] I did, I kind of looked at it as more of a question. And I can't. Not only can't, because can't is your capability, but my desire. Do I want to live my life for anyone else's pleasure or fulfillment other than my own?\" she told British Vogue. \"Like singing for hundreds of thousands of people isn't really the thing that I love. There's no connection. There's no safety.\" Miley later clarified her comments, sharing a statement on Instagram last month. \"For clarity I feel connected to my fans NOW more than ever. When I win, WE win. \u2764\ufe0f,\" she began. \"Even if I don't see them face to face every night at a concert, my fans are felt deeply in my heart. I'm constantly creating and innovating new ways that I can stay connected to the audience I love -- without sacrificing my own essentials.\" \"Performing for YOU has been some of the best days of my life & we will continue this journey together as we have for the last almost two decades,\" she continued. \"This has nothing to do with a lack of appreciation for the fans & everything to do with I simply don't want to get ready in a locker room. Which is the reality of life on the road.\" \"These looks I've been turning don't travel well. The archival looks don't fold. I just don't want to sleep on a moving bus,\" Miley added, before noting that this is \"what's best\" for her currently, but she may \"change\" how she feels in the future. 2. Shawn Mendes Shawn Mendes recently opted to cancel all of his upcoming tour dates in order to prioritize his mental health. While reflecting on the situation in an open letter to fans, Shawn admitted he didn't realize what a \"toll\" being on the road would\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Why Every Traveler Should Know Taylor Swift\u2019s Upcoming Concert Cities and Dates\ndate: 2023-10-21\nbody: I travel to 20+ countries a year sharing my firsthand knowledge of reward travel, travel credit card deals, travel tips and more. Even if you\u2019re not a Taylor Swift fan, or a Swiftie, as I understand they\u2019re called, you have to at least respect what this talented musician and businesswoman has done to the entertainment industry \u2026 and the economy, for that matter. Wherever she goes, her fans follow and prices go up considerably for everything but especially lodging. RELATED: Taylor Swift\u2019s Clever Southwest Airlines Tip For Keeping the Seat Next to You Empty According to the U.S. Travel Association, Taylor Swift has had an unprecedented impact: \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour went to 20 U.S. cities, and the concertgoers far outpaced typical spending patterns. Swift fans\u2013\u2013\u201cSwifties\u201d\u2013\u2013averaged $1,300 of spending in local economies on travel, hotel stays, food, as well as merchandise and costumes. That amount of spending is on par with the Super Bowl, but this time it happened on 53 different nights in 20 different locations over the course of five months. Downtowns across the country have enjoyed an influx of visitors\u2014and a spending boost thanks to Taylor Swift.\u201d Keep in mind this is just her U.S. tour. Her worldwide tour is set to kick-off next month in Argentina and then Brazil before taking a break for Christmas, then continuing to the world by storm in 2024. She has 90 concerts planned spanning from Australia to Zurich in 19 countries. Her full schedule can be found below. My wife was disappointed when she missed her L.A. concert since it took place just four miles from where we live. So I suggested we go to one of her international stops. However, we would need someplace we could leave our kids with good friends or family members for the five hours we would be away. We settled on the closest and what made most sense, Natalie\u2019s native Toronto, which is where Taylor is ending her Eras Tour, a week before Thanksgiving 2024. When I spoke to my brother yesterday, he said he wanted to join us and take his daughter. I was shocked he\u2019s even a fan but he said he just saw her movie and it was so inspiring. We both quipped how crazy it that she\u2019s everywhere. You turn on a football game, there she is. Turn on SNL or late night TV or the radio and there she is. I happened to have the local news on when my brother called and I said the anchors are literally taking about her right now. (There\u2019s a Taylor Swift academic conference to be held by Indiana University.) While researching stories for today\u2019s travel news round-up, I came across a piece in the New York Times titled: \u201cWant to See Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour?

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:40AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Putin\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: US dismisses Putin\u2019s claim that west was behind Dagestan antisemitic riots\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: The United States has dismissed Russia\u2019s attempt to blame Ukraine and the west for an antisemitic riot at an airport in Muslim-majority Dagestan. President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine and \u201cagents of western special services\u201d after a mob descended on Makhachkala airport in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus on Sunday evening in search of Jewish passengers on a plane that arrived from Israel. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, said on Monday the riot was the result of a \u201cprovocation\u201d orchestrated from outside Russia, with Ukraine playing a \u201cdirect and key role\u201d. Earlier in the day, Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, claimed the unrest was \u201cthe result of external intervention, including external information influence\u201d. Neither Zakharova or Peskov provided evidence to support their claims of outside interference. Asked about the accusations against the west at a White House briefing, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: \u201cClassic Russian rhetoric, when something goes bad in your country, you blame somebody else.\u201d \u201cThe west had nothing to do with this. This is just hate, bigotry and intimidation, pure and simple,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cSome people will compare it to the pogroms of the late 19th and early 20th century and I think that\u2019s probably an apt description, given that video that we\u2019ve seen out there,\u201d he said of anti-Jewish attacks. Kirby criticised Putin for not doing more to condemn the violence, which he described as \u201ca chilling demonstration of hate\u201d. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller earlier called Russian allegations of Ukrainian involvement \u201cabsurd\u201d. \u201cWe call on Russian authorities to publicly condemn these violent protests, to hold anyone involved accountable and to ensure the safety of Israelis and Jews in Russia,\u201d Miller said. Ukraine \u2013 which Russia invaded last year \u2013 has also strongly rejected the allegations and pointed to Russia\u2019s \u201cdeep-rooted antisemitism\u201d. The anti-Jewish demonstrations come against the backdrop of Putin taking a pro-Palestinian stance in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, a position that aligns the Kremlin with its ally Iran in what analysts have described as a growing global divide between east and west. Last week, a senior Hamas delegation travelled to Moscow to meet Russian officials in the organisation\u2019s first high-profile international visit since it launched a raid in southern Israel on 7 October. Israel criticised the visit, saying inviting Hamas \u201csends a message legitimising terrorism\u201d.

A crowd stormed the airport in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim republic in southern Russia, reportedly looking for Israeli passengers. Russian police took over the airport in response, and Putin on Monday called a meeting of security officials to discuss the incident. Kirby called the scene a \u201cchilling demonstration of hate, bigotry, intimidation.\u201d \u201cMr. Putin has decided to have some sort of meeting with the security officials, but outside of that, we\u2019ve heard crickets from the Kremlin,\u201d he added. He stressed that Putin did not condemn the protests when they occurred the day prior. \u201cNothing, and I think that speaks volumes,\u201d Kirby said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that \u201cexternal interference\u201d was to blame for the incident, which included people in the crowd holding signs saying, \u201cChild killers are not welcome in Dagestan,\u201d and, \u201cWe\u2019re against Jewish refugees.\u201d Kirby mocked the notion that it was external inference, telling reporters, \u201cIsn\u2019t that sweet?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s classic Russia rhetoric isn\u2019t it? When something goes bad, you\u2019re blaming somebody else, blame it on outside influences. The West had nothing to do with it, this is just hate, bigotry, and intimidation,\u201d he said, adding that a \u201cgood leader\u201d like President Biden calls out hate for what it is. The protest in Russia comes as Israel has expanded its ground operations into Gaza over the weekend, about three weeks after militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. Peskov said Monday that during the security meeting Putin called for, officials will discuss \u201cattempts by the West to use the events in the Middle East to divide the [Russian] society,\u201d The Associated Press reported . \u201cIt is well known and obvious that yesterday\u2019s event around the Makhachkala airport is largely the result of outside interference, including information influence from outside,\u201d he said during his daily news conference, according to the AP.

Donald Trump bragged during a campaign speech about threatening to abandon U.S. allies, even if Russia attacked one of them. Trump appeared in Sioux City, Iowa, on Sunday. During his speech, he made a series of bizarre comments, including mistaking the city for Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and pronouncing Canada as \u201cCanya.\u201d But he notably also said he had threatened to withhold U.S. military aid from NATO members unless they paid the bloc more. He said, at one point, he told member state leaders, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to protect you any longer.\u201d \u201cThe head of a country stood up, said, \u2018Does that mean if Russia attacks my country, you will not be there?\u2019 That\u2019s right, that\u2019s what it means,\u201d Trump said to applause. \u201cI will not protect you.\u201d \u201cAnd the money came!\u201d Trump\u2019s refusal to step in even in the case of a Russian attack is notable considering how much he loves Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir Putin. Trump and Putin enjoy a particularly cozy relationship , and Trump has repeatedly praised the Russian president. Given the fact that Republican support for the war in Ukraine is on the wane, Putin must be overjoyed that the party\u2019s presidential front-runner is actively advocating letting Russia attack whichever countries it wants. Trump falsely claimed throughout his presidency that the other NATO members had failed to make sufficient contributions to the alliance. In 2018, he accused other countries of owing the U.S. \u201ca tremendous amount of money from many years back, where they\u2019re delinquent as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d He also threatened to withdraw the U.S. from NATO over the other countries\u2019 supposed unpaid dues. But in reality, the U.S. has never been shortchanged by NATO allies. \u201cThere is no ledger that maintains accounts of what countries pay and owe,\u201d Aaron O\u2019Connell, a former Obama administration National Security Council staffer, told NPR in 2018. \u201cNATO is not like a club with annual membership fees.\u201d That fact hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from resurrecting his NATO falsehoods during his current campaign. Trump also bragged about his threat to abandon NATO allies to Russian attacks during an early October campaign stop in Waterloo, Iowa.

As the invasion of Ukraine began, Russians fled the country in droves. And now, 100,000 Russians are living in Georgia. But there's significant concern among some Georgians that their arrival will lead to a \"Russification\" of their country and be used as a pretext for Russia to invade Georgia again, as it did in 2008 when they took about 20% of Georgia's sovereign territory. Denial of Georgia's EU membership bid would be \"a big victory for Russia,\" President Zourabichvili says Emmanuil Lisnif, George Smorgulenko and Pavel Bakhadov arrived in Tbilisi last year. All Russians in their twenties, they fled their home country for fear of being drafted or punished for speaking out against President Vladimir Putin. Alfonsi spoke with the three young men at the Russian-owned comedy club where they work. She asked Bakhadov why he decided to speak to 60 Minutes. \"For me, it's really important to say for the big audience that can see this, that Russians are really against the war,\" explained Bakhadov. Bakhadov said there is anti-Russian graffiti that is visible from his apartment window: \"Russians Go Home.\" But Bakhadov doesn't pay that suggestion any mind. \"I'm already home,\" he told Alfonsi. 60 Minutes also spoke with a married couple, Viktor Lyagushkin and Bogdana Vashchenko, who have a unique story. Lyagushkin is Russian. Vashchenko is Ukrainian. Before the war, they lived in Moscow and worked documenting underwater caves for National Geographic. When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Vashchenko, who holds a Ukrainian passport, says she became terrified about what could happen to her in Russia and feared for her friends and family still living in Ukraine. She said she couldn't tolerate living in Russia, the aggressor in a war against her home country. \"Physically, psychologically, I couldn't. I couldn't stay there. I couldn't sleep,\" Vashchenko said. They decided to flee Moscow. Lyagushkin phoned some friends that were living up north, hoping they could stay with them before fleeing to Norway. They asked whether Vashchenko supported \"fascists\" in Ukraine and explained that if she did, they would have to report her to Russian intelligence. The couple then drove more than 1,200 miles from Moscow to Tbilisi. Vashchenko said she hid under a blanket in the backseat of their car because she was so afraid of what might happen to Ukrainians at Russian checkpoints. They eventually made it across the Georgian border. \"I\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Alabama US Senator \u2018Coach\u2019 Tuberville Blames the Dems for Gaza and Ukraine.\ndate: 2023-10-28\nbody: Tommy Tuberville, the Senator form Alabama who has been blocking more than 250 military appointments, claimed in a radio interview that if Ukraine had just given land to the Russian Aggressor, that war could have ended before it started. History shows he was not correct. Hitler was appeased in that way before WW II but still went on to conquer much of Europe and murder millions of people in doing so and ended up costing tens of thousands of American lives to stop eventually stop him. During an interview that aired Thursday on Mobile, AL radio\u2019s FM Talk 106.5, Tuberville maintained President Biden stood in the way of an agreement between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the early stages of the conflict that would have resulted in Ukraine conceding land. If true, history shows it was the correct stance to take. Not satisfied with his Russian apologist stance, in a Newsmax interview, Tuberville also claimed the Israeli-Hamas conflict is also the fault of the Democrats. \u201cThey need to be worried about what\u2019s going on in Ukraine, the Middle East, the wars that their side, the Democrats, and Joe Biden have created.\u201d \u2018Coach\u2019 Tuberville said.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:40AM\nGiven a question from a America user: China\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: China\u2019s billionaires looking to move their cash, and themselves, out\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Billionaires are notoriously difficult to track. It\u2019s no surprise \u2013 the easier they and their assets are to find, the easier they are to tax. But by all accounts, the number of uber-wealthy people in China is in decline. Of the world\u2019s estimated 2,640 billionaires, at least 562 are thought to be in China, according to Forbes, down from 607 last year. With crackdowns on financiers and a roiling political climate, many of China\u2019s rich people are looking to move their money, and themselves, out of the country. China\u2019s elites have long looked for ways to take their money overseas. Officially, individuals are only allowed to transfer $50,000 (\u00a341,000) out of the country each year. But in practice wealthy people have a range of official and unofficial ways of shifting their funds, whether that is through money exchanges in Hong Kong, where capital controls do not apply, or funnelling cash into overseas businesses. Related: China seeks to stifle public grief for former premier Li Keqiang In August, police in Shanghai arrested five people who worked at an immigration consultancy, including the company\u2019s boss, on suspicion of facilitating illegal foreign exchange transactions in excess of 100m yuan (\u00a311m). In a state media report, the police said \u201cillegal foreign exchange trading seriously disrupts the order of the country\u2019s financial market\u201d. Before the pandemic, about $150bn flowed out of China each year via tourists taking their funds overseas, according to estimates from the Natixis, a bank. Although international travel has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, high US interest rates and a weak yuan are a strong incentive for cash-rich Chinese to move their money out of the country, economists say. In the first half of 2023, there was a shortfall of $19.5bn in China\u2019s balance of payments data, which economists use as an indicator of capital flight, although the true value of money unofficially leaving the economy may be higher. Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, says that \u201ca high level of uncertainty about future economic policies and business opportunities in China\u201d also encourages people to take their savings out of the country. In 2021, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, resurrected a call for \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d, which was widely interpreted as a call for tycoons to share their wealth more widely. That year Alibaba\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Crumbling buildings and broken dreams: China\u2019s unfinished homes\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: Taichung, Taiwan \u2013 Around a tiled square on the outskirts of the Chinese city of Nanjing, a cluster of apartment buildings rise like concrete columns towards a grey sky. At first glance, the structures look like a testament to China\u2019s awe-inspiring construction boom, which saw the country use more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the United States did throughout the entire 20th century. But upon closer examination, the development is more like a scene out of a post-apocalyptic story than a symbol of grandeur. There is no light in any of the buildings and most of them lack doors or windows. An eerie silence lies over the compound, which is strewn with disassembled equipment and construction materials, broken occasionally only by the sound of a tarp flapping lazily about on top of a stack of iron rods. There are no residents in sight. \u201cThe workers stopped building in 2019,\u201d Ji Zhang, a 61-year-old resident who asked to be referred to by a pseudonym, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThey say it was because the developer ran out of money.\u201d Over a grainy video call, Ji gestures towards one of the unfinished high-rises, where she and her husband purchased a sixth-floor apartment in 2017. Ji felt like they were buying into a dream when they poured most of their life savings into a 60 percent down payment for the property. \u201cIt was all just an old village back then, but when the sales agents showed us the plans for the area, I saw how it could give my husband and me the retirement we were looking for,\u201d Ji said. The compound promised a range of modern amenities, proximity to an array of shopping options and access to far better medical facilities than the urban village outside Nanjing where Ji and her husband had been living. Most importantly, the apartment offered the chance for Ji and her husband to live much closer to their daughter and two grandchildren in Nanjing. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t had a chance to enjoy any of that,\u201d Ji said with tears in her eyes. But with their apartment still unfinished five years after their purchase, Ji\u2019s retirement dream lies in tatters. \u201cAnd this is not just happening to us,\u201d Ji said, wiping away her tears. \u201cIt is unfortunately happening all over China.\u201d \u2018Rotten-tail buildings\u2019 Across China, from Guilin in southern China to Dalian in the north, countless home buyers have emptied their life savings into homes that never materialised.

Wang Yi met with Biden, as well as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, during a three-day visit to Washington. Both sides agreed to work toward a bilateral meeting on the side of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco that begins Nov. 11. In an statement released by China\u2019s foreign ministry summarizing the discussions, Wang said the road to the bilateral meeting would not be \u201csmooth sailing\u201d and that they could not rely on \u201cautopilot\u201d to make it happen. Wang\u2019s visit to Washington came at a time when tensions between the countries remain high, including over U.S. export controls on advanced technology and China\u2019s more assertive actions in the East and South China seas. The statement said that although there are still many issues to be resolved, both sides believe that it is both beneficial and necessary for the U.S. and China to maintain dialogue. The meeting is the latest in a series of high-level contacts between the two countries as they explore the possibility of stabilizing an increasingly tense relationship at a time of conflict in Ukraine and Israel. According to the foreign ministry statement, Wang also said that China and the U.S. needed a \u201creturn to Bali,\u201d in a reference to Xi and Biden\u2019s meeting at a G20 summit last year, where both officials discussed issues relating to Taiwan, U.S.-China trade tensions as well as cooperation to address issues like climate change, health and food security. Wang said that the two countries must \u201celiminate interference, overcome obstacles, enhance consensus and accumulate results.\u201d Other issues discussed between Wang and Biden included military exchanges between the U.S. and China, as well as financial, technological and cultural exchanges and cooperation, as well as the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: China\u2019s censors warn against \u2018effusive comments\u2019 while mourning Li Keqiang\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: China\u2019s government censors have ordered media and government WeChat accounts to be on the lookout for \u201coverly effusive\u201d comments about former Premier Li Keqiang as the country prepares for his cremation on Thursday. The instructions were leaked to the China Digital Times along with details on how to report information about Li\u2019s death, such as exclusively using content from state-run Xinhua, CCTV, or the People\u2019s Daily and instructions to monitor the comments section. The warning about \u201ceffusive comments\u201d reflects fear that such phrases might \u201coffer exaggerated praise on the surface of what is actually an act of criticism\u201d, the Digital Times said, in this case against Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chinese censorship of the internet is such that many users will often speak in code to criticise the government, making use of homophones, \u201ctypos\u201d, or slang to stay one step ahead of censors. Deaths of political leaders are considered particularly sensitive in China as they have been linked to political upheaval in the past, most famously in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests that followed the death of reformist leader Hu Yaobang. The Digital Times said similar restrictions were posted by government censors last year following the death of former President Jiang Zemin. The advice came as China said Li, who died from a heart attack at the age of 68, would be cremated on Thursday, with flags flown at half-mast. Describing the former premier as an \u201coutstanding\u201d leader, the Xinhua news agency said Li\u2019s remains had been transferred from Shanghai to Beijing on a special flight on Friday. \u201cHe was extolled as an excellent CPC member, a time-tested and loyal communist soldier and an outstanding proletarian revolutionist, statesman and leader of the Party and the state,\u201d the state news agency said. Known for his pro-reform agenda, Li\u2019s political legacy stands in contrast to Xi, who has consolidated personal power since taking office more than a decade ago and reversed many aspects of China\u2019s economic opening. By the time he stepped down in 2023 at the end of his second term as premier, Li had been effectively sidelined as a political force and did not continue into an unprecedented third term like Xi. Comments from internet users have reportedly included the phrase \u201cthe Yangtze and the Yellow River won\u2019t flow backwards\u201d, a famous saying of Li promising that reforms would continue in China, which has been seen as a tacit criticism of Xi\u2019s ag\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: US Navy Sends Warships To China If Order Comes From The President And Congress To Protect Taiwan\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: This article asissted with AI. The US Navy is readying its formidable fleet in the event the President and Congress decide to safeguard Taiwan. With tensions rising in the region, the strategic importance of Taiwan cannot be understated. As China continues to flex its military muscle and assert its territorial claims, the US must ensure that Taiwan remains a stable and secure ally within the Pacific. The US Navy possesses immense capabilities to project power across the seas. Its aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines serve as crucial assets that can effectively deter potential adversaries and maintain a strong presence in the region. In close coordination with its allies and partners, the US Navy can contribute significantly to regional stability and uphold global norms. However, any decision to protect Taiwan should be carefully considered, taking into account the possible ramifications and potential escalation of tensions. Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation should be prioritized, as a military confrontation could have far-reaching consequences. Nonetheless, the US Navy stands ready to fulfill its duty to protect American interests and ensure the security of its allies if called upon to do so. China's recent threat to the US regarding a potential conflict arising from a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is concerning. Tensions have been escalating between the US and China, and such a statement only heightens the already strained relationship between the two nations. The issue of Taiwan's sovereignty has long been contentious, and any military action by China would have serious implications for regional stability. It is crucial for the US to carefully navigate this situation. The US has historically supported Taiwan and has a vested interest in maintaining peace and stability in the region. However, getting involved in a potential conflict between China and Taiwan could escalate tensions further and potentially have severe consequences for both sides. Diplomacy must be prioritized to defuse this volatile situation. Engaging in dialogue and negotiations is essential in finding peaceful resolutions. It is also crucial for the international community to play a role in facilitating discussions between China and Taiwan to avoid any military confrontation. Ultimately, it is in everyone's best interest to find a peaceful resolution to this dispute. The US should continue to support Taiwan in diplomatic efforts and encourage dialogue rather than exacerbating tensions. Only through diplomacy and dialogue can a potential conflict be avoided, ensuring stability and peace in the region. Follow me as this conflict like so many we are involved with grows.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Yahoo Finance Live's Rachelle Akuffo and Akiko Fujita preview the earnings expectations for chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 which is set to report earnings on Tuesday, October 31 \u2014 and Apple (AAPL) \u2014 reporting on Thursday, November 2. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: What to expect from Apple's Q4 2023 earnings report\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Apple's fourth fiscal quarter results will be issued on November 2. Here's what happened in the quarter and what to expect Apple will reveal in its figures. \u2014 Apple confirmed on October 5 that it will announce its fourth-quarter earnings on November 2. As is customary for the results, a conference call will follow, hosted by CEOTim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri, with the results due at around 4:30 p.m. ET followed by the call itself from 5:00 p.m. ET. Last Quarter: Q3 details \u2014 Apple's results release for thelast quarter, Q3, was relatively level for the company, with it posting revenue of $81.8 billion for the period, down just 1% year-on-year. The quarterly earnings per diluted share was up 5% year-on-year, however, at $1.26. Traditionally the quietest quarter, iPhone revenue was down 2% year-on-year to $39.67 billion, with iPad down 20% to $5.79 billion, and Mac down 7% to $6.84 billion. Wearables, Home, and Accessories saw a 2% rise to $8.28 billion, and Services saw an 8% YoY growth to $21.21 billion. For the quarter, Cook mentioned the \"all-time revenue record\" for Services driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions. Maestri said the quarterly YoY performance improved from the March quarter and that Apple had a \"very strong operating cash flow of $26 billion.\" During the Q3 quarter, Apple made several product introductions, including theM2 Max and M2 Ultra versions of the Mac Studio, the Mac Pro with Apple Silicon, and the 15-inch MacBook Air. While the launches had a small effect on the Q3 results, their availability throughout the whole of Q4 should be more meaningful for investors. This was also the quarter that Apple WWDC revealed the Apple Vision Pro, a product that won't have any meaningful impact on the balance sheet until its launch, sometime in early 2024. As usual for Apple's financials, the company declined to offer a forecast for the Q4 results. \u2014 Year-Ago Quarter: Q4 2022 With year-on-year figures being important to investors, the data points compared to the year-ago quarter of Q4 2022 will be important. At that time, Apple earned $90.15 billion in revenue, with an earnings per share of $1.29. Revenue from iPhone was up 9.7% to $42.6 billion, iPad went down 13.1% to $7.17 billion, and Mac sales skyrocketed 25.4% to $11.5 billion. Services reached $19.18 billion, and Wearables, Home, and Accessories rose to $9.65 billion. What happened in Q4 2023 The quarter, which runs from the start of July until the end of September, is usually a great time for Apple to introduce the products that it will be releasing to take advantage of holiday season sales. Due to the timing, this will always include the annual September Special Event, which sees the launch of iPhones. There were slightly fewer products launched in the quarter than in Q4 2022, partly because of the timing of launches in both periods. For example, Apple launched an updated MacBook Air at the start of Q4 2022, but it launched the Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and MacBook Air at the end of Q3 2023 instead. The key items, as usual, were the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple also introduced an update to the AirPods Pro to include a USB-C ase, as well as new USB-C EarPods, the Apple Watch Series 9, and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Since these were all introduced on September 22, there will be minimal impact to Apple's revenue since any possible preorders or purchases were only made in a little more than a week in the quarter itself. Investors probably won't see much benefit from the launches for the quarter, with the holiday season sales during the next quarter, Q1, will always be the big one to watch for. What Wall Street Thinks Using figures sourced from Yahoo Finance on October 23, a consensus of 24 analysts reckon that Apple will report a revenue of $89.25 billion on average. The estimates ranged from $87.8 billion at the low end to $92.1 billion on the high side. The group's earnings per share estimate is $1.39, based on the opinions of 28 analysts. The range is from $1.35 to $1.45. Analysts monitored by CNN Money on October 23 believe the fourth quarter revenue will be $90.3 billion on average. The range goes from $82.8 billion at the lowest point to $97.2 billion at the highest. The earnings per share estimates have a consensus of $1.36, ranging from $1.17 to $1.51. On Marketwatch on October 23, the analyst estimate consensus for the earnings per share is $1.39, with a range of $1.35 to $1.45. Individual analysts on Apple JP Morgan In an October 30 note from JP Morgan seen by AppleInsider, analysts believe that revenue of $88.9 billion will be reported for the fourth quarter, implying a -1 YoY decline. Slow momentum in consumer spending on smartphones, PCs, and tablets is blamed for this trend. There is an expected growth of 7% in iPhone revenue to $45.8 billion, thanks to a period of inventory build and an extra week of shipping compared to the iPhone 14 series. Lower demand in China and underwhelming consumer spending momentum have been \"driving an elongation of the replacement cycle,\" JPM reckons, impacting sales of recently launched products. Services is expected to reach double-digit growth again, offsetting hardware revenue contractions. Price increases for Services products will help accelerate growth, but JPM thinks it will also drive consumers towards bundled plans. Apple will \"modestly beat consensus for earnings with tight cost control and robust gross margins,\" the analysts write, in what is described as results that \"fare better than feared.\" Earnings per share is forecast at $1.40. JPM has a 12-month price target of $2.30 and rates Apple as \"Overweight.\" Morgan Stanley The October 30 note from Morgan Stanley has Apple posting a \"better than expected Sept Q but guide to a below seasonal/Consensus Dec Q,\" which creates \"a tactically cautious setup.\" Overall revenue is expected to hit $89.9 billion with a $1.39 EPS. Revenue from iPhones is thought to be around $45 billion, with Canalys and IDC figures indicating shipments of 50M to 53M in the quarter as being higher than Morgan Stanley's 48M forecast. \"We know iPhone channel inventory was at the low end of the normal range coming into the quarter, and thus it's reasonable to assume shipments could have outpaced builds in the quarter given the need to fill the channel,\" the firm writes. An acceleration of Services growth is expected again, and record gross margins are expected to be called out during the results. AAPL is rated as \"Overweight\" by Morgan Stanley, with a 12-month price target of $210. Oppenheimer In an October 30 interview, Oppenheimer cut its price target for Apple from $220 to $200, citing China demand concerns and \"macro-related factors.\" A lack of return for consumer sentiment and worsening exchange rate headwinds make the quarter tough for the iPhone maker. For the period, it is reckoned that iPhone, Mac, and iPad shipments will be \"weaker than what we expect.\" However, demand in North America and Europe is still considered \"pretty healthy,\" thanks to \"robust\" net additions from carriers. Piper Sandler Piper Sandler used its pre-financials note to discuss Q1 2024 earnings estimates rather than Q4 2023. The discussions were largely about weak demand in China potentially harming Q1 earnings and the iPhone \n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Video Report: Apple earnings preview: Investors brace for iPhone 15 headwinds and sales guidance\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: Get ready for a double whammy from Apple next week with a rare Monday event and Q4 earnings report on Thursday.

The new line-up of MacBooks, which are priced between $1,299 and $2,499, are expected to launch over the coming weeks and provide some support for Apple's product sales over the holiday quarter, following a disappointing spring and uncertain demand over the summer months. Apple is also advancing its drive into chip design following its split with Intel INTC in 2020, with the new MacBooks powered by a trio of new chips, the M3, the M3 Pro and the M3 Max, the latter of which can be used for AI developers and could be seen as an early challenge to Nvidia ( NVDA ) - Get Free Report early market dominance. Apple will publish its fourth quarter earnings after the close of trading Thursday, with analysts looking for a bottom line of $1.39 per share, up 7.8% from the same period last year, on revenues of $89.28 billion. Key to the update, however, will be Apple's forecast for the holiday quarter, with sales of the new MacBooks now a crucial factor following suggestions that take-up of the new iPhone 15 has been weaker-than-expected in key markets, including the U.S. and China, following its launch in early September. Apple shares were marked 0.32% lower in pre-market trading to indicate a Tuesday opening bell price of $169.75 each.

Asa Hutchinson on Monday unveiled a federal law enforcement reform plan that he's calling \"critically important\" and overdue -- and a preview of legislation he would push if he is elected president in 2024 . \"If there's anything that my life has represented, it is both my faith but it's also support for the rule of law,\" Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor now seeking the Republican presidential nomination, told \"GMA3.\" \"I've spent my private life, my public career, defending the rule of law and our justice system -- and it needs a correction. We haven't had a major reform in our federal law enforcement in over 20 years.\" Hutchinson said his proposal is intended to help restore confidence in federal law enforcement by giving them more accountability -- by requiring agent interviews be recorded, for instance -- without undercutting the mission of public safety and protecting the nation. The proposal includes eight reforms: transferring drug enforcement responsibilities from the FBI to the Drug Enforcement Administration; elevating the Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties now under the FBI's general counsel to the FBI director's office; requiring the FBI to record agent interviews; reassigning administrative support offices within the FBI to the Department of Justice; creating a unified charter for federal law enforcement agencies; establishing a commission on the future of federal law enforcement; reforming intelligence collection under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and reaffirming the relationship between the president and attorney general. Hutchinson is holding a press conference at 3 p.m. ET at the National Press Club in Washington to discuss the proposal.

Brown\ndate: 2023-10-02\nbody: The National Policing Institute (NPI) is honored to recognize two leaders for their significant and positive impacts on the law enforcement profession overall, and the agencies and communities they have each so admirably served. NPI\u2019s National Awards Program comprises two prestigious recognitions: the Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy Award for Leading Change in Policing and, for the first time, the Hubert Williams Equal Justice and Effective Policing Award. These awards recognize the boldness and forward-thinking efforts of law enforcement leaders and professionals consistent with NPI\u2019s mission to pursue excellence in policing through science and innovation. This year, former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey is honored with the Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy Award. Former Houston Mayor and NYPD Commissioner the Honorable Lee Brown is receiving the inaugural Hubert Williams Award. Both recipients will be honored during a closed reception in San Diego, in October. As recipient of the Patrick V. Murphy Award, Commissioner Ramsey exemplified Murphy\u2019s legacy of leading change in policing that encourages more professional policing and safer communities. For more than 35 years, Commissioner Ramsey has been established as a recognized innovator, educator, and practitioner of community policing. While serving across many major police departments, he spearheaded the development of cutting-edge policing strategies and organizational change. Commissioner Ramsey also refocused those departments on crime fighting and prevention by implementing a more accountable organizational structure, new technology, and innovative homeland security and counter-terrorism efforts. Commissioner Ramsey\u2019s accomplishments directly resulted in the decline of violent crime in Philadelphia and encouraged the emphasis on evidence-based policing and neighborhood-based policing initiatives.

The report lists 12 overarching improvements to enhance the trust afforded to Interior Department law enforcement, support the safety, health and wellness of officers, and ensure that law enforcement programs effectively continue to provide for safe and equitable access to public lands and the free exercise of fundamental rights in public spaces. The Department\u2019s Law Enforcement Task Force, established in 2021 by Secretary Deb Haaland and led by Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau, was charged with implementing a vision of utilizing an equity lens and evidence-based decision making to identify opportunities for improvement in the law enforcement programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. \u201cLaw enforcement professionals at the Interior Department work every day to ensure that everyone who visits our public lands and waters can recreate safely. Their service is critical in helping the Department realize its mission as they work diligently to solve complex crimes and keep personnel, visitors and our nation\u2019s natural resources safe,\u201d said Secretary Deb Haaland. \u201cI am grateful for the leadership of Deputy Secretary Beaudreau and the members of the Task Force who have spent months listening to the public and our workforce to develop recommendations that will help ensure law enforcement officers have what they need to do their job and help the Department lead the way towards community-centered law enforcement that ensures transparency and accountability.\u201d \u201cThe recommendations outlined in the Task Force\u2019s report will help strengthen the unique connection that law enforcement officers have with the communities that they serve and continues the Interior Department's leadership in supporting law enforcement officers and strengthening policing practices to be more equitable and community-oriented,\u201d said Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible honor to work alongside dedicated career Interior officials and law enforcement leaders who come to work every day focused on creating a better environment for their peers and the public that they serve.\u201d The Task Force held listening sessions, invited public comment, engaged with Tribal stakeholders, and coordinated various internal and external questionnaires to ensure that a wide range of perspectives were included in the new recommendations. The recommendations build on the Interior Department\u2019s progress to develop law enforcement policies that advance transparent and accountable polic\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: How does law enforcement know if you\u2019re too high to drive? What California law says\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: Though California has legalized the use of recreational marijuana, there are laws surrounding how much you can have and where you can use it . When it comes to using then driving, how high is too high to drive? How does law enforcement test for a cannabis-induced DUI? Here\u2019s what California law states on driving under the influence of the recreational drug: Marijuana effects while driving According to the California Office of Traffic Safety website , marijuana can have the following effects on a driver: Slows reaction time and ability to make decisions Controls the part of the brain responsible for body movement, balance and coordination Impairs judgment and memory Negatively impacts attentiveness Impacts perception of time and speed \u201cThe effect of marijuana is strongest during the first 30 minutes after consumption,\u201d the website states. While these effects can be delayed if the marijuana is ingested rather than smoked, the website states people who drive immediately after using marijuana can increase their risk of getting into an accident by 25% to 35%. Is there a legal limit for cannabis and driving? California Vehicle Code 23152 states it is illegal for a person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol to drive. That includes cannabis. While California\u2019s level of impairment for drunken driving is a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or higher for those of legal drinking age, there is no similar way law enforcement measures what is \u201ctoo high.\u201d Matt Radke, a spokesperson for California Highway Patrol, said a person\u2019s level of cannabis influence is subjective. \u201cWhen it comes to driving under the influence of cannabis much like with an alcoholic beverage, it is a totality of circumstances while driving,\u201d Radke wrote in an email to The Bee. A person would get pulled over to be tested for sobriety depending on their driving patterns. If a person does have drugs in their system at the time they were driving, Radke said it would be determined by a blood test. \u201cTesting is ongoing to assist law enforcement with determining which level of cannabis in the system is too much to be driving,\u201d Radke wrote. Cannabis can be detected in a person\u2019s blood system for up to 12 hours, according to the American Addiction Centers website .

This funding is designed to not only assist with the Department\u2019s crime reduction efforts, but also to provide much needed assistance to agencies looking to expand their law enforcement mental health and wellness services, combat the distribution and trafficking of illicit drugs, and receive active shooter training. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement underscores the Justice Department\u2019s commitment to supporting our state and local law enforcement partners as we work together to keep our communities safe,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B.

The Justice Department will continue to do everything in our power to get law enforcement officers the resources and assistance needed to help keep them and their communities safe.\u201d \u201cEvery day, across the country, our state and local law enforcement partners are working tirelessly on the ground to protect our communities and preserve public safety,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O.

The latter is a general celebrity fixture, often defined by outrageous excesses and Kardashian-esque displays of said excesses. But Pitt is hardly one to flaunt. It's no secret that the man in possession of countless awards and nearly synonymous with Hollywood iconography itself is rich. And we mean filthy rich. His net worth estimably soars near the $400 million mark, with Forbes further broadcasting his affluence by ranking him sixth on its 2023 list of the world's highest-paid entertainers. What sets Pitt apart from his more flamboyant peers in showbiz is his relationship with the monied status he enjoys. To say Pitt lives lavishly would be a gross understatement; palatial homes, innumerable automobiles, overwhelmingly expensive watches, and rare antiques account handsomely for his investments. The details of it sometimes don't even become general public knowledge but add to his Hollywood legend in an unassuming, elegant manner that mimics his own. When he splurges on a vacation rental or buys a multimillion-dollar property, it does become front-page news. But many of his indulgences are meant for private satisfaction. As Pitt once expressed to Esquire, \"I like the feel of a Leica camera or the way a watch feels. I don't want to look ostentatious, but if you come close, you notice.\" Let us, by getting up close into the incredibly lavish life Brad Pitt leads. The value of Brad Pitt's real estate portfolio is through the roof Prudent real estate decisions are central to the status of the ultra-rich and Brad Pitt is a great example. Since the 1990s, when films like \"Thelma & Louise\" and \"Legends of the Fall\" set him on the path to stardom, Pitt has made judicious use of his ever-booming fame and money for property investments across the world. In 1994, he forked over a cool $1.7 million on a Los Feliz home, and then proceeded to fork over a few more million to expand it. As noted in Architectural Digest, Pitt reportedly swapped out this property in 2023 for a smaller pad in the same neighborhood that he bought off oil heiress Aileen Getty for $5.5 million.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Jessica Chastain Was Once Told She Wasn\u2019t Allowed to Work With Brad Pitt in a Film\ndate: 2023-10-21\nbody: By a stroke of luck, Jessica Chastain was able to collaborate with Brad Pitt in the Terrence Malick movie \u2018Tree of Life\u2019. Brad Pitt was one actor that the Zero Dark Thirty star Jessica Chastain never thought she\u2019d work with. Especially since she lost a role in a potential Pitt film because of who she was in the movie industry. Jessica Chastain wasn\u2019t big enough to work with Brad Pitt Chastain once shared that she wasn\u2019t initially meant to co-star with Pitt in a Tree of Life. Before the Terrence Malick feature, Chastain was still a bit of an unknown. She tried auditioning with Pitt in another film, and couldn\u2019t secure the role because of her lack of starpower. \u201cRight before I auditioned for the Tree of Life, I was a complete unknown,\u201d Chastain once told Vanity Fair. \u201cAnd there was an audition for a film that Brad was going to do, and I was supposed to play opposite him. And I was trying to get an audition, and then I heard back, \u2018Never cast an unknown opposite Brad Pitt.\u2019 So I couldn\u2019t even go in and audition.\u201d When she was cast in Tree of Life, her husband was going to be another actor. But as luck would have it, her co-star would drop out of the project. Pitt would later be cast in his place. \u201cAnd I thought, in four months it went from \u2018we\u2019ll never cast an unknown opposite Brad Pitt to, now, I am playing his wife. I just could feel like something in my life had clicked, and that things had started to change,\u201d she said. Jessica Chastain was tired of being asked about kissing Brad Pitt With Chastain and Pitt playing a married couple in Terrence Malick\u2019s Tree of Life, many were curious about their make-out scenes. Not even Chastain expected to ever lock lips with the Oscar-winner when she was an up and coming actor. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to choose characters who were interesting to me and didn\u2019t really follow the money path,\u201d Chastain once told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cBut working with Brad Pitt? I never really imagined that someday I would play his wife. It\u2019s like, wow is this really my life? And then you just have to get rid of that feeling on go on.\u201d During their time on set, Chastain commented on the actor\u2019s modest approach to collaboration, which surprised Chastain given his celebrity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t carry himself as an international movie star and doesn\u2019t\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: 'I Am Miserable': Fans Love Brad Pitt And Tom Cruise In Interview With The Vampire, But The Former Really Hated Filming The Movie\ndate: 2023-10-19\nbody: Although Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt are still two of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, Interview with the Vampire remains the only time these two have worked together. The film adaptation of Anne Rice\u2019s same-named novel saw Cruise and Pitt respectively playing lead bloodsuckers Lestat de Lioncourt and Louise de Pointe du Lac, and in addition to its commercial success, the movie has assembled a sizable fanbase since its release in 1994. Ironically though, Pitt really hated shooting the flick, even going so far to say he was \u201cmiserable\u201d during the production. Interview with the Vampire is certainly one of the more dour of Brad Pitt\u2019s movies, with Louis soon regretting being turned into a vampire by Lestat and seeing this form of immortality as a curse rather than a gift. While speaking with EW , the interviewer noted that Pitt looked miserable in the movie, and he confirmed as such, adding that it was \u201csix months in the fucking dark\u201d and described himself as playing the \u201cbitch role.\u201d As Pitt elaborated, despite being familiar with the Interview with the Vampire book, his expectation for playing the character got turned on its head when he received the script just two weeks before filming started, and he hadn\u2019t read any earlier drafts. When the interviewer that once someone\u2019s a movie star, they can ask to see the script much earlier, Pitt answered: Related Stories Christian Slater Has A Lingering Question About Tom Cruise\u2019s Interview With The Vampire He\u2019d Like Answered The Advice Tom Cruise Gave Kirsten Dunst That Helped Her Land Her Iconic Interview With The Vampire Role When Interview with the Vampire came out, Brad Pitt had only recently started gaining recognition from movies like Thelma & Louise and A River Runs Through It . Between Interview and Legends of the Fall in 1994 (the latter actually shot before the former, but came out afterwards), followed by Seven and 12 Monkeys the year after, Pitt would soon be catapulted to worldwide fame. That said, the actor admitted that when he was cast as Louis, he had \u201cnothing,\u201d so he couldn\u2019t afford to be choosy. Still, one can\u2019t fault him for being disappointed that Interview with the Vampire ended up being more of a \u201cTom Cruise vehicle,\u201d although Pitt did commend his cost\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Jessica Chastain Had an Unscripted Fight With Brad Pitt That Was Kept in Their Film: \u2018It Was Absolutely Real\u2019\ndate: 2023-10-20\nbody: Brad Pitt and Oscar-winner Jessica Chastain admittedly lost themselves in their characters during an intense fight scene. And the film\u2019s director thought it was too compelling to leave off the feature. How Jessica Chastain\u2019s on-screen argument with Brad Pitt got out of hand Chastain and Pitt both collaborated on the coming-of-age film Tree of Life directed by Terrence Malick. The pair played a married couple in the film, taking care of their three young children when tragedy strikes their family. In an interview with CBS News , Chastain shared that she\u2019d been attached to the project for a very long time. Back then, everyone she knew couldn\u2019t stop talking about Chastain playing the Fight Club star \u2018s wife. But some didn\u2019t believe it because of her movie\u2019s long film delay. \u201cThen I get Tree of Life opposite Brad Pitt. I mean, is there a bigger movie star? And everyone\u2019s telling, \u2018Yeah, Jessica\u2019s playing Brad Pitt\u2019s wife. They\u2019re married in this film, and it\u2019s with Terrence Malick,\u2019\u201d Chastain said. \u201cYears are going by. Nothing\u2019s coming out. So at one point my mom called me up laughing. She goes, \u2018Everyone thinks we\u2019re lying!\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018What are you doing in L.A.? Because none of your movies are coming out.\u2019 But then I had the last laugh.\u201d Eventually, Tree of Life would see production. And while acting opposite Pitt, a scene required the two actors to simulate a heated argument. But they\u2019d gotten so immersed into their characters that they surprised themselves. \u201cAnd at one point, I don\u2019t know why, what on earth possessed me, but I grabbed the pepper and rubbed it on his face and said, \u2018How do you like it!\u2019 And then he grabbed me and all of the sudden we\u2019re like fighting and struggling and when you see, you can see that we both look shocked because it was absolutely real,\u201d Chastain once told Collider . \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Terry said, \u2018I want to create a physical violence between the two.\u2019 It\u2019s not even in the script that anything like that happens.\u201d Brad Pitt had to discipline his younger \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 co-stars because they couldn\u2019t get over working with him Tree of Life was a much quieter project than the commercial hits Pitt was known to star in.

There are sugar alcohols\ncreated synthetically\nused to sweeten without adding many calories or carbs. Sugar alcohols are technically not artificial sweeteners; they can also be found in whole food sources like fruits and vegetables. Natural or novel sweeteners are also common: monk fruit and stevia, for instance, are extracted from plants.\nAccording to registered dietitian nutritionist\nJill Weisenberger\n, focus less on the type of substitute and more on the amount. The healthiest sugar substitute, therefore, is a small quantity: A\nlarge amount of any sugar substitute could be harmful\n.\n\u201cThe dose makes the poison,\u201d Weisenberger says.\nSo which sugar substitute should you pick? It could come down to your personal preference of taste, or you could regularly switch up your substitute of choice.\n\u201cThey all have such different chemical structures, so they will all behave differently in the body,\u201d Weisenberger says. \u201cAdverse effects always come up with a dose amount \u2026 so anybody who\u2019s concerned about the safety of it could sometimes use stevia, sometimes use sucralose\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\nThe Best and Worst Sweeteners, According to an RD - HUM Nutrition\nThe Best and Worst Sweeteners, According to an RD | HUM Nutrition Blog\nAcne\nDryness\nDullness\nAging\nTips\nAll Skin Articles\nHair\nWeight\nDetox\nDigestion\nFitness\nSexual\nImmunity\nAll Body Articles\nEnergy\nStress\nSleep\nMood\nAll Mind Articles\nRecipes\nHealthy Eating\nAll Food Articles\nSupplements\nExperts\nStudies\nExplained\nAll Science Articles\nVideos\nTHE WELLNEST \u2022\nFood\n\u2022\nHealthy Eating\nThe Best and Worst Sweeteners, According to an RD\nBy\nJessica Bippen, MS, RD\n\u2022\nUpdated January 5, 2023\nShare this article\nTwitter\nFacebook\nPinterest\nEmail\nCopy Link\nHere to give you the definitive guide to the best and worst sweeteners for your health is HUM Nutritionist\nJessica Bippen, MS, RD\n.\nIf you have a killer sweet tooth, you\u2019ve come to the right place to learn more about it. The reality is that you may crave sugar because you have so much sugar in your diet.\nThe USDA estimates that the average American consumes over seven tablespoons of added sugars per day. This excessive sugar intake\nlinks to higher calorie consumption and lower diet quality\n. In turn, this leads to an\nincreased risk of weight gain\nand other more serious medical conditions.\nBut even with these facts, most of us aren\u2019t going to cut it out of our lives completely. As a result, people are now at least looking for healthier alternatives. So it\u2019s no surprise that companies are jumping on the opportunity by providing plenty of options. But are any of these sugar substitutes actually healthy?\nWhich sweetener is best, and what are the sweeteners to avoid? Keep reading to find out more.\nWhat Are the Best and Worst Sweeteners?\nDates, honey maple syrup, and coconut sugar are your best sugar alternatives. The occasional use of stevia and monk fruit are also good options. The worst sweeteners include artificial sweeteners like sucralose, saccharin, and aspartame, high fructose corn syrup, agave, and brown rice syrup.

Economists at Goldman Sachs were previously forecasting a two- to three-week shutdown in this quarter, during which Congress\u2019 current Nov. 17 funding deadline falls. They now see a shutdown this year as unlikely due to Congress grappling with geopolitical challenges and the new leadership in the House of Representatives after Republicans elected Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. \"With new geopolitical risks and a new House Speaker, Congress now looks likely to avoid a government shutdown altogether this year,\" the Goldman Sachs economists wrote. GOP LEADERS CELEBRATE CLEARING MAJOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING HURDLE JUST A DAY AFTER JOHNSON WAS ELECTED SPEAKER \"For now, we are removing any shutdown assumption from our forecast,\" the economists added. \"Coupled with other changes to our GDP forecast caused by data released this morning, we have boosted our Q4 GDP growth estimate to +1.6% and lowered our 2024Q1 estimate to +1.7%. \" Congress faces a funding deadline of Nov. 17 to pass legislation funding the government or else a partial shutdown will begin that weekend. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Recently elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has indicated he would back a stopgap continuing resolution (CR) providing funding until Jan. 15 or April 15 of next year, depending on which gets more support from House Republicans. Johnson said Sunday on FOX News\u2019 \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that reaching an agreement on government funding is his \"top priority.\" THE SHAKESPEAREAN DRAMA SURROUNDING THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE The duration of the CR will depend on the House GOP\u2019s threadbare majority , which can only afford four defections while still passing legislation along party lines \u2014 issues that could arise with government funding bills as well as anticipated aid packages for Israel and Ukraine.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images). WASHINGTON \u2014 Newly elected U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has three weeks to broker an agreement with Democrats to avoid a partial government shutdown when a short-term spending law expires on Nov. 17. The Louisiana Republican, who has leaped from relative obscurity to one of the four congressional leaders, has already spoken with his Senate counterparts and met with President Joe Biden, though it\u2019s unclear how he\u2019ll handle the transition from lawmaker to top U.S. leader. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Thursday that Johnson has his support as Johnson \u201cbegins to steer the House Republican majority.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHouse and Senate Republicans need to work together on a number of urgent priorities, beginning with supplemental appropriations for a number of our national security priorities.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said shortly before McConnell spoke that he had called Johnson to congratulate him and encouraged him to pursue bipartisanship on must-pass bills. \u201cWhether House Republicans like it or not, this is divided government,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cBipartisanship is the only way we\u2019ll be able to get anything done.\u201d The Democratic Senate and Republican House, Schumer said, must work together to provide funding for Israel and Ukraine. \u201cTo allow (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to succeed is to endanger America\u2019s national security and it\u2019s alarming that a growing number of House Republicans don\u2019t seem to care about this,\u201d Schumer said. Schumer also cautioned Johnson against trying to cut funding in the full-year government funding bills below the levels agreed to this summer as part of the debt limit deal. \u201cThey\u2019ll be dead on arrival,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAll they\u2019ll do is waste more time in a moment where every day counts.\u201d An adjustment to power Johnson, who won the Republican nomination for speaker late Tuesday and was elected on the floor Wednesday, is relatively unknown to several of his colleagues in the Senate as well as Democrats in the House.

Joe Courtney said they ask for updates on a looming government shutdown. \u201cBelieve me, they watch this like a box score in terms of the approaching deadlines,\u201d Courtney said near a TSA screening line in Bradley\u2019s Terminal A on Monday. \u201cEvery time I fly down here, they know us in terms of the delegation, and they always ask what\u2019s the latest.\u201d Employees of the agency have a vested interest in congressional actions to fund the federal government before Nov. 17, when a continuing resolution passed late last month will run out and trigger a government shutdown. They are among the essential employees who will be expected to continue showing up to work but will not be paid until the government is funded again. About 271 TSA officers work in Connecticut airports, according to the White House, and the possibility of a shutdown was among the issues on some of their minds Monday as the congressman and a small entourage weaved through the roped-off security lines and chatted with officers as they directed travelers and screened baggage. Courtney, a Democrat from Vernon, had some potentially good news for the security officials: although the House had spent the last three weeks struggling to select a leader, recently elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, had signaled a willingness to pass another continuing resolution to fund the government until at least January. \u201cContinuing resolutions is not a good way to fund government, having said that, with the turmoil that\u2019s been happening down there, I think that\u2019s encouraging that people understand the use of shutdowns to leverage people\u2019s pet policies really has just got to stop,\u201d Courtney said. A continuing resolution would at least ensure that airport security officers are paid through what is expected to be a heavy travel period during this year\u2019s holiday season. So far, 2023 has been a transitional year for the security agency which employs more than 50,000 officers nationwide. In July, TSA enacted pay raises included in the 2023 budget, which brought the agency\u2019s pay rates more in line with the rest of the federal government and resulted in an average increase of 26% for officers, according to a press release. Despite those increases, Courtney said officers should not be forced to go without pay due to a government shutdown. \u201cFederal employees by law are entitled to get reimbursed with the government reopens after these ridiculous events but that is not any sort of solace for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey still by and large live mostly paycheck to paycheck and that\u2019s just unacceptable that they have to have their pay periods interrupted.\u201d Meanwhile, TSA has also recently upgraded the security technology it uses, including new Analogic CT X-ray scanners, which the agency installed at Bradley back in March.

The city targeted six areas across four City Wards for these projects. The seven-month-long initiatives, costing about $600,000, were funded by the Liquid Fuel State Funding and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021. Roberta Cosentino, Assistant City Manager, stated that this was a major road-repair project for the city since the intersection realignment. The work involved repairing damaged areas, replacing 27 sidewalk ADA ramps, a guard rail, and restoring a collapsed water inlet to address stormwater infrastructure. Six key road segments were also improved. Coatesville collaborated with Cedarville Engineering to identify the roads needing the most attention, including a key entry point on 13th Avenue. The city worked alongside PA American Water to upgrade their infrastructure and improve the surrounding area. Linda Lavender-Norris, Coatesville City Council President, linked road repair to residents' safety. She said the improvements would increase accessibility and reduce accidents and vehicle damage by repairing potholes. She also appreciated the city's partnership with PA American Water to meet their infrastructure needs and enhance residents' quality of life.

(WKRN) \u2014 Tennessee is set to receive more than $1 billion in funding for infrastructure repairs and projects, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration has announced. The funding supports investment in critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges and tunnels, carbon emission reduction, and safety improvements via 12 formula programs. The funding will also support workforce development for the projects and go directly to Tennessee, providing transportation leaders within the state with flexibility to continue the work of rebuilding roads and bridges and improving the transportation systems. \u201cLong-needed major improvements are coming to America\u2019s network of roads, bridges, and highways,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. \u201cThanks to President Biden, we are proud to deliver funding to modernize roads and bridges across America\u2014strengthening our supply chains, creating good-paying jobs, and connecting Americans to every corner of the country.\u201d Passenger rail support continues to grow in TN The largest investment in Tennessee comes from the National Highway Performance Program, with more than $641 million.

Seventy projects in 35 states and Washington, D.C., are recipients of the funding. This year\u2019s allocation is the largest that has ever been dispensed partly because of disruptions in the supply chain caused by COVID-19. The federal funding will support track repair, rail upgrades, bridge work and construction of new rail lines and facilities. Aging and outdated railroads limit speed and weight, so the upcoming modernization projects will deliver faster railways and increase the efficiency of economic exchanges. Many of the projects funded will involve replacing older railways more prone to breakage and derailments. These rail modernization initiatives will not only increase safety but will also bolster the national economy. At the same time, they signal massive new opportunities for private sector contractors. Massachusetts received $108 million, covering 80% of the project\u2019s total cost, to deliver new intercity passenger rail service routes. The project will include a new rail track between Springfield and Worcester and upgrade other tracks and signals so passenger trains can travel at speeds up to 80 mph. Additionally, a second passing track for about 23 miles of the route will be constructed so that more trains can use the rail corridor. California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority received $202 million for a project to create six rail-grade separations in Shafter, California. This funding is also from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. It will cover construction costs and right-of-way acquisitions required. The project will include locating grade separations at six road-rail intersections either above or below the railway to promote efficiency for commuters and eliminate traffic buildup at rail crossings. This will improve safety by eliminating the risks of crossing paths with trains traveling 220 miles per hour. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) has finalized a formal agreement with Norfolk Southern Corporation to expand passenger rail service on the Amtrak line in Western Pennsylvania. With federal support, the commonwealth will invest more than $200 million in railway and safety improvements. Currently, the Pennsylvanian Amtrak service travels roundtrip between New York City and Pittsburgh via Harrisburg once daily. Once completed, this project will facilitate rail service twice daily. The project will include track and signal improvements at five stations - Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Portage, Altoona and Harrisburg - and sidetracks to allow freight trains to move out of the way for passenger trains.

The Dynasty icon, 90, opened up about the moment in her new memoir Behind the Shoulder Pads: Tales I Tell My Friends , published Tuesday. While Collins was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth in 2015 for her services to drama and charity work and had previously met Princess Kate, the actress admitted that she forgot to curtsy to the royal at the Platinum Jubilee Pageant in June 2022. After participating in a motorcade down The Mall in London, Collins said that she received a warm welcome from members of the royal family. \"Finally, we arrived outside the Royal Box, which was packed with royals and relatives of the Queen. As we descended from the Jaguar, trying to look presentable after two hours in the freezing wind, Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo waved at us excitedly. Then he nudged Princess Anne, who nudged Prince Charles and Queen Camilla , and they all waved, smiled at us, and mouthed, 'Well done!' Very gratifying indeed,\" she wrote in Behind the Shoulder Pads .

Okay, that may be a bit dramatic, but all of parenting is a balancing act, even when you\u2019re royals like Prince William and Kate Middleton . While it\u2019s well-known that they\u2019ve been trying to give their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis as much of a normal life as possible, one royal expert claims they\u2019re starting to get worried about when social media will come into play. Prince William & Kate Middleton's Country Home Might Be Haunted Speaking to Express.co.uk , royal expert Richards Fitzwilliams claims, \u201c[ Kate and William ] are wisely concerned at any overexposure of [George] and of Charlotte and Louis.\u201d Basically, they\u2019re afraid that since George is third in line, there will be a bigger spotlight on him, and that their two youngest will be put under a microscope (and with social media highlighting all of it even more)! \u201cWhether as Page of Honour at the Coronation or blowing bubbles on a visit to Canada, whatever he does as he is the future King is of interest,\u201d Fitzwilliams added. \u201cWe are fed titbits, that George enjoys dancing, plays tennis or likes a pizza, and we get regular photographs of him on special occasions and see him at certain royal events. His parents, however, are well aware of the need for him and his siblings to have privacy as they grow up,\u201d Fitzwilliams added. \u201c\u2026The younger they are, the more likely they are to steal the show with childish antics which get publicised worldwide and make the monarchy seem more relatable.\u201d While trying to balance the royal kids\u2019 lives isn\u2019t a new concept (heck, we saw how Princess Diana tried to ensure William and Prince Harry would have somewhat of a normal life), social media has added a wrinkle the royals are still trying to navigate. William and Kate share three children named George , 9, Charlotte, 8, and Louis , 5. William and Kate: A Royal Love Story by Christopher Andersen Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s life as parents and husband and wife has been well documented over the course of their marriage. But when royal fans go back long before the couple\u2019s 2011 nuptials, they find a love story with twists and turns.

Since its premiere in November 2016, the historical drama has captivated admirers of the royal family, but it has also drawn criticism. The first half of the show's last season, which is supposed to focus on Princess Diana's last months and the terrible effects of her passing on her family and the wider community, has drawn harsh criticism. The late Queen's life as she neared her Golden Jubilee, Charles and Camilla's marriage, and William and Kate's developing romance will all be covered in the second section. Harry The Duke of Sussex is the royal who has spoken out the loudest over the contentious Netflix series. Following his departure from the Firm in February 2021, Harry discussed The Crown on The Late Late Show with James Corden. They don't pose as news, he declared. It's made up. But it's only partially grounded in reality. It provides you with a general understanding of that way of life, the constraints of prioritizing duty and service over family and other commitments, and the potential consequences. \"I\u2019m way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my wife, or myself.\" The Duke then declared that Damian Lewis, an actor, would be his first choice to portray him on the program. The prince was questioned once more about the series in May, a few months later, on Dax Shepard's podcast, The Armchair Expert. \"I've seen elements of it...I hear it's very popular,\" the royal jokingly said. He continued by telling Shepard that Corden had only now questioned him about it. \"I don\u2019t think you ever get used to it [having your life written about] but it is part of that life where you kind of have to\u2014at least or certainly I was told this for many years\u2014it\u2019s just the way that it is you have to accept that they are going to write XYZ about you.\" \"You might ask, 'But what if it's not true?'\" Yes, exactly, and the saying goes, \"Well, just don't show them that you care because if you do, they'll do it more and more and more.\" You're essentially out of luck because there isn't a way out of this situation.\" The Duke acknowledged having watched the Netflix series in January 2\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Princess Diana's Feud With This Well-Loved Royal Family Member Proves There Is Always Drama at the Palace\ndate: 2023-10-25\nbody: Prince Harry\u2019s feud with King Charles III and Prince William has been at the top of the news cycle for the last three years, but there have been plenty of royal tiffs over the years. The palace pretends that this the first rift to surface in the modern era when it was quite clear that Princess Diana didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with Charles\u2019 sister, Princess Anne. How Queen Elizabeth's Role as 'Granny' Helped Her Pull off a Surprise Even Her Family Didn't Know About The disagreement began over godchildren. Charles was godfather to Anne\u2019s oldest child, Peter Phillips, but he didn\u2019t return the favor when William was baptized. According to Battle of Brothers: William and Harry \u2013 The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult author, Robert Lacey, Diana was blamed for the oversight. \u201cAccording to [a] rumor, [Charles] had very much wanted to invite his sister, only to be blocked by his wife [the late Princess Diana],\u201d he told the New York Post. Anne reportedly didn\u2019t have the kindest nickname for her sister-in-law, calling her \u201cThe Dope\u201d behind her back. She also didn\u2019t love that the Princess of Wales was grabbing all of the headlines despite Anne\u2019s label of being \u201cthe hardest working royal.\u201d ( A very familiar topic in the royal household!) When it was time for Harry to be christened in 1984, Diana skipped over Anne again for the godmother position. Anne took it in her own hands to spend the weekend \u201cout in the Gloucestershire countryside, 85 miles to the west, shooting rabbits\u201d instead of going to the baptism. Buy: \u2018Battle of Brothers: William and Harry \u2013 The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult\u2019 $15.08 Anne reportedly made the excuse that she had planned the trip three months in advance and \u201cfelt that it would be rude to un-invite her guests to her country home.\u201d She sent her kids, Zara, and Peter, instead. So there was no love lost between the two women and it just proves that the palace has a long history of family feuds, long before Harry and Meghan Markle.

The Duchess of Sussex depicted her in-laws as bigoted during her 2021 tell-all with Oprah Winfrey , and historian Dr. Ed Owens discussed how the Sussexes changed the British monarchy's legacy forever . \"The story is a slightly tragic one as it has damaged this idea of a family monarchy. This idea that this is a united group who embody, if you like, the best of British family life ,\" Owens told an outlet. \"Originally King Charles III 's reign was going to be based around him being supported by his two trusty lieutenants \u2014 William and Harry,\" he continued. \"But when that went so disastrously wrong in early 2020 because of Harry and Meghan's decision to leave Britain, it really put paid to that vision of the family monarchy .\" Meghan and Harry's desire to share their side of things changed the couple's relationship with Charles and William . \"And then of course we've had the Sussexes airing their dirty laundry in public for the best part of three years \u2014 and again it has done much damage to that narrative of happy family life,\" the expert added. \"So why not, as I suggest in my book, do away with this family narrative once and for all? We don't need to have this big royal family presenting themselves as moral exemplars,\" he explained. \"King Charles is uniquely placed because he knows first-hand that the ideal of the family rarely matches the reality of the family monarchy .\" Commentator Tessa Dunlop warned that Charles' rift with Harry could weaken The Firm . \"By 1980 the pressure on Charles was huge. Britain wanted another royal wedding . On the surface, his marriage looked like the perfect second act \u2014 another blushing bride with her sailor prince,\" Dunlop shared in reference to his split from Princess Diana . \"But times had changed: divorce was prevalent, celebrity culture distorting, infidelity unacceptable. Charles and Diana\u2019s giant wedding ended in giant failure,\" Dunlop said. \"Charles is the product of his generation just as his parents were of theirs. But can our everyman king find a new brand as potent as family monarchy? Let's hope so for the sake of our divided nation .\" In 2021, Meghan admitted that she strugg\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Now is Oct 31, 2023, Tue, 10:42AM\nGiven a question from a America user: Amazon's expansion into new markets\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\nArticle No.: 1\ntitle: Amazon continues Hawaii expansion with $415M investment, 500 new jobs for residents\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Amazon is revealing details of its much-anticipated expansion plans in Hawaii, saying that it plans to hire hundreds of people for a new facility in Sand Island. Consumers and local retailers alike are excited about the retailer\u2019s plans, which include the opening of a new three-story distribution facility on Auiki Street. Amazon purchased the 15-acre lot in 2020. \u201cPackages will fly in, they\u2019ll get trucked via our truck to the facility at Sand Island roughly overnight and then 10 o\u2019clock in the morning you\u2019ll start to see packages coming out of the facility,\u201d said Stephen Maduli-Williams, senior economic development manager at Amazon. Amazon executives told members of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii at their annual meeting in Waikiki that 900 people already work for the company in Hawaii. Once the new Sand Island facility opens in April, it\u2019ll employ up to 500 additional people. Amazon has invested $415 million into Hawaii, including $200 million into the Sand Island facility, $125 million into another facility in Kapolei. Executives say customers won\u2019t necessarily see more bulky items shipped to Hawaii. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll probably see is a great selection of things that you are already receiving and you most certainly should get them faster,\u201d said Maduli-Williams. There are concerns and questions about Amazon entering the Hawaii market, but Tina Yamaki, Retail Merchants of Hawaii president, says big business and small business can work together. \u201cYou can shop at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning eating Cheetos, in your pajamas, and no one is going to judge you, but Amazon does have programs that will help our local retailers,\u201d said Yamaki. Jimmy Tokioka, director at Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism, said Amazon\u2019s expansion must be accompanied by a \u201cbuy local\u201d message. \u201cAmazon is going to be a part of this local community and it\u2019s important that we support local businesses as well,\u201d he said. Company officials also stressed working with local businesses. \u201cIn Hawaii, we have 1,200 sellers today, but we feel there\u2019s a lot more work that we can do here on the islands,\u201d said Bobby Co, sales manager at Amazon. The company will also partner with six to eight entrepreneurs that can deliver their products once on island. To facilitate that, Amazon will have a sellers\u2019 training event next month, hiring events early next year and it expects to open its Sand Island center in April. Copyright 2023 Hawaii News Now.

The tech giant has added 39 new renewable energy projects in Europe this year, contributing over one gigawatt of clean energy capacity to grids across the continent. With a total of 160 wind and solar projects in 13 European countries, Amazon is making a substantial impact in the transition towards a greener future. Once all the projects are operational, they are expected to provide 5.8 gigawatts of clean energy capacity, which is enough to power more than 4.7 million European households annually. Among the new projects are 15 rooftop solar installations on Amazon facilities and 24 utility-scale wind and solar projects, including the company\u2019s first solar farm in Greece. These investments not only contribute to the decarbonization of energy grids but also stimulate local economies and create job opportunities. According to an economic model developed by Amazon, its European wind and solar farms have generated an estimated \u20ac2.4 billion in investment and contributed over \u20ac723 million to the region\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) between 2014 and 2022. In 2022 alone, these projects supported more than 3,900 full-time equivalent jobs. The impact of Amazon\u2019s renewable energy investments is validated by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the independent economic advisory firm, Oxford Economics. Amazon\u2019s latest projects include rooftop solar installations in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK, as well as utility-scale solar and wind projects in Finland, Germany, Greece, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The company is on track to power its operations, including data centers, fulfillment centers, and physical stores, with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original target. Lindsay McQuade, Director of Energy, EMEA at Amazon, emphasizes the importance of corporate investment in driving the clean energy transition. She states, \u201cWith more than 160 wind and solar projects in Europe, Amazon is helping to provide new sources of clean energy to local grids, creating jobs, and supporting local businesses as we progress toward powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.\u201d Amazon\u2019s commitment to renewable energy not only benefits the environment but also has a positive economic impact. By investing in clean energy, the company is contributing to the growth of local economies, creating employment opportunities, and accelerating the transition towards a sustainable future. #RenewableEnergyRevolution #CleanEnergyEurope #Amazon\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: New Opportunities Arise for Amazon as Earnings Surpass Expectations\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: Amazon experienced a significant boost in its stock value after surpassing earnings expectations.

Amazon Rebounds After A Tough Year Last year, Amazon was dealing with a weakened demand as pandemic restrictions eased while unfavorable macroeconomic factors, i.e. inflation, restricted consumers\u2019 wallets. But 2023 has been a year of revenue growth so far, showing CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s cost-cutting efforts are paying off. Back in March, Amazon announced another round of layoffs impacting 9,000 jobs, in addition to the 18,000 that were confirmed in January, along with a hiring freeze. But this year also came with its challenges as last month, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states have sued Amazon in a landmark monopoly case that alleges the e-commerce titan abused its economic dominance and harmed fair competition. Amazon\u2019s Third Quarter Highlights For the September quarter, Amazon recorded revenue of $143.1 billion which implies a 13% YoY increase. For the quarter that ended on September 30th, Amazon more than tripled its net income as it earned a profit of $9.9 billion that also topped estimates. Operating profit amounted to $11.2 billion, with an operating margin of 7.8% implying a more than 2% YoY increase, while also breaking the previous record from 2021\u2019s first quarter when it amounted to 8.2%. Amazon Web Services experienced a 12% expansion as revenue amounted to $23.1 billion. When it comes to the cloud, Microsoft won this round as it reported a 29% growth, followed by Google whose cloud revenue rose 22%. Microsoft surpassed $31.8 billion in cloud revenue in its latest reported quarter, while Google also reported a substantial rise with revenue totaling $8.41 billion. Amazon is really trying to maintain its cloud dominance, but competition is only getting more intense and generative AI is further elevating the stakes. According to estimates from Synergy Research Group, Amazon held a market share of 32% in the third quarter, followed by Microsoft owning 21% with Azure, but Microsoft experienced a 1% rise in market share compared to the second quarter while both Amazon and Google seem to be losing market share. The core e-commerce segment continued to recover, expanding 7% YoY,\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Swift's new boyfriend Travis Kelce is on the field with Brittany's husband Patrick Mahomes and they have been spending time together watching their guys win games and at after parties and even dinners that have nothing to do with football. A source tells TMZ that the friendship isn't for the cameras or convenience\u2014they've actually exchanged their personal phone numbers. The digit exchange happened way back on September 24, when Swift attended her first Kansas City Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium and they've been texting ever since. They've also reportedly taken shots together and have a \u201cspecial handshake\u201d that was captured on camera on October 22 and went viral. Brittany also received one of the commemorative gift baskets that Swift distributed for the release of the 1989 (Taylor's Version) album this week. On Saturday, the NFL star's wife showed off the basket's contents in an Instagram Story playing \u201cWildest Dreams.\u201d It's contents included a copy of the album, a limited edition 1989 cardigan, and a handwritten note. All that could be seen of the note that was legible are the words, \u201cOh hi! As I re-release and reclaim my beloved 1989 album, I wanted to send you..\u201d An insider told US Weekly earlier in October, \u201cBrittany is thrilled to be building a genuine friendship with Taylor.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve hung out a couple of times and have grown fairly close in a short period of time,' the insider continued,\u201d the source continued. \u201cBrittany thinks Taylor is so sweet, and down to earth, and they get along really great.\u201d And it helps that Kelce and Patrick are close. \u201cThe fact that Patrick and Travis are best friends makes things even better,\u201d they explained. \u201c[Brittany and Taylor] are having a blast and love cheering on their men together.\u201d\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Taylor Swift becomes a 400lb pumpkin \u2013 and the star of Halloween\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: Last week, Taylor Swift became a billionaire. She also became a 399lb pumpkin. For 35 years, Jeanette Paras has \u201cpumpkinized\u201d celebrities, turning giant gourds into their likenesses in an effort to drum up breast cancer awareness for charities. This year, her muse was a no-brainer: Swift\u2019s record-breaking Eras tour and concert documentary were cultural events, and her romance with the NFL star Travis Kelce dominates tabloid headlines. \u201cThis is probably my favorite character so far,\u201d says Paras, who has also painted gourds of Ted Lasso, Kim Jong-un and Rudy Giuliani. \u201cI really think Taylor would like it. For a round, 400lb, giant celebrity pumpkin, I think it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d It took Paras about 12 hours using acrylic paint to complete Swift\u2019s face, and she affixed nine wigs to the top to create the musician\u2019s signature dirty blonde hair. There\u2019s no word on whether Swift has seen the finished work. Around the country and on TikTok, people are turning their Halloween decor into Swiftie installations. It\u2019s not just Paras\u2019s 399lb pumpkin, which is parked outside her Dublin, Ohio, house and has drawn visitors from as far away as Florida and California. In Zionsville, Indiana, Michal Owens dressed two 12ft skeletons as Swift and Kelce waving a \u201cTaylor Swift for President\u201d flag. Back east in Sleepy Hollow, New York, Denise Scaglione built a \u201cboyfriend graveyard\u201d with names of the singer\u2019s many exes written on faux stones. In Phoenix, Arizona, Heather Corcoran, a stay-at-home mom, says she \u201cneeds to find ways to be creative\u201d. Her neighborhood takes Halloween seriously, so Corcoran pulled \u201cspookier elements\u201d from Swift\u2019s music videos and appearances, setting each one up outside her lawn. There are lots of skeletons, naturally, with one wearing a shirt that reads \u201cWho\u2019s Taylor Swift Anyway? Ew\u201d. (Fans recognized this as a cheeky top Swift wears on stage.) Corcoran dressed another body of bones in a frosty blue ball gown similar to the Oscar de la Renta number Swift donned at the Eras Tour film premiere. \u201cI probably spent around $400 on the display, total,\u201d Corcoran says. \u201cI sewed a lot of the costumes starting around September. I\u2019d say it took me 20 hours or so.\u201d She\u2019s also made 200 friendship bracelets, so that kids waiting for the school bus nearby can trade accessories, mimicking a tradition that concertgoers began at this summer\u2019s tour. \u201cHer fans are such diehards, and they\u2019ll do anything to show support,\u201d Corcoran says. \u201cI\u2019m 37 years\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: 22 New York Restaurants Where Taylor Swift Has Dined\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: It\u2019s been a long time coming: October 27 marks the newest Taylor Swift release, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s version), a re-recording of her 2014 album with a few new tracks. With it, we have reached peak Swift: We cannot escape it, as much as some of us might try. The effect of the global superstar has rippled through everyday life, spiking NFL ratings, movie ticket sales, Netflix shows, and Amazon documentaries. Her fame has spawned actual university courses and given rise to jobs reporting about her. There is now such a thing as Swiftonomics. For New Yorkers, the Taylor Swift effect means it\u2019s even harder to get reservations at the restaurants where she has dined. Combine a recent Swift visit with the infuriating opacity of Resy, and you might as well forget landing a table \u2014 unless, of course, you know someone. Meanwhile, all over town, tourist and local Swifties are following her restaurant visits, chasing their tails trying to track them down, in hopes of catching the remnants of her bejeweled vibes and, in their wildest dreams, witness the rare event of her return to a restaurant. Whether you\u2019re marking spots she has visited as future go-tos or places to avoid, here are 22 places where Tribeca resident Taylor Swift has dined.

Phil Murphy used his taxpayer-funded expense account for nearly $12,000 worth of food and drinks at MetLife Stadium \u2014 including at a Taylor Swift concert and a hip-hop music festival, according to public records obtained by POLITICO. Now, after being questioned about the justifications for the costs, the governor\u2019s office says it is asking the state Democratic Party to reimburse taxpayers for the entertainment. Murphy\u2019s use of his expense account has not attracted attention since he took office in 2018. But his Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, found himself under scrutiny by the news media for similar spending and had the Republican State Committee reimburse the state more than $82,000 in concession costs at MetLife Stadium. Murphy's office said the Democratic State Committee was initially expected to cover the stadium costs but didn\u2019t. The state was left with the bill, which was paid via Murphy\u2019s $95,000-a-year expense account \u2014 a longstanding line item in the state budget which has been consistently renewed under Murphy and his predecessors. Budget language says the governor\u2019s expense account is for \"Official Receptions, Official Residence, and Other Official Expenses.\" The expense account is barred from being used for \u201cpersonal purposes\u201d and it cannot supplement the governor\u2019s annual $175,000 salary. Jennifer Sciortino, a spokesperson for Murphy, said the governor\u2019s office \u201chad every expectation\u201d that the state party would cover the stadium expenses at the time because it \u201ctraditionally covers these costs.\u201d \u201cOnce it was clear that there were outstanding bills that had not been paid, the state stepped up to meet this responsibility,\" Sciortino said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cWe are pursuing reimbursement from the state party for costs incurred at MetLife Stadium,\u201d she added in a follow-up statement. Phil Swibinski, a spokesperson for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, said in a statement that the organization \u201chad no knowledge\u201d of the invoices since they came before the current party leadership. \"We are looking into the matter in order to determine whether any additional action is necessary at this time,\" he said. Records from the governor\u2019s expense account do not show taxpayers picking up MetLife Stadium expenses after 2019. How Murphy spent over the years The records, obtained through the Open Public Records Act, offer a partial glimpse into how taxpayer dollars help fund a more private part of the governor's job away from bill signings and press conferences. Murphy has used the expense account for \"official state gifts\" and catering for receptions he's hosted, typically at Drumthwacket, the governor's mansion in Princeton. State gifts included cufflinks and $100 custom plates, according to the records.

A game changer. A trip to see Taylor Swift in concert for the biggest tour in the history of tours, Eras, and you can win a pair of tickets to the show. And the concert you\u2019ll attend is in Paris, France. You get airfare too, and 3 nights in a hotel in addition to the concert tickets. Plus $500 cash. The trip to Paris, France got me wondering if I\u2019d ever been to Paris, Maine. So, I did a little research about our Maine town named Paris. Yes, it was named after Paris, France. The Town of Paris is called \u2018Heartbeat of the Hills.\u2019 Elizabeth Knox is the Town Clerk in Paris and we spoke early last week. She was kind enough to spend time with me talking about Paris, and also answered a few hypothetical questions about the differences between Paris France and Paris Maine And with the Taylor Swift concert in France coming up, I wondered if Paris Maine was to be the one hosting the concert where would it be held? Is there an arena for example? Elizabeth suggested: Paris Hill Country Club would be big enough to host a Taylor Swift concert. But it would have to be outside. Okay, it would be a nice summertime event. I asked about where concert goers and Taylor Swift herself could stay when they were there, and South Paris has a place on Main Street, which is Highway 26, Paris Inn Motel. And a nice touristy place to visit would be Mclaughlin Gardens, also on Main Street. A historic site listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a cultural landscape. Wow. And famous for lilacs, so let plan a trip in the month of May. Visitors (and locals) are going to get hungry, and Elizabeth let me know about the 8 different restaurants in Paris, Maine. The Square, Maurice\u2019s, Luchador Tacos, and others. Okay, you won\u2019t go hungry when in Paris. Want to get out and take a look at the scenery? The Little Androscoggin River is right there. And since Paris is a place where you\u2019re going to fall in love, they have a local jewelry store, Creaser Jewelers specializing in Maine gemstones. Who wouldn't love a trip to Paris.

The relationship between the entertainment industry and the fashion industry has been crucial, not only in California but globally. 1. Setting Global Trends: Global fashion trends have been established by Hollywood celebrities, both on and off screen. The attire worn by celebrities on the red carpet or in popular films and television shows frequently sets the tone for upcoming fashion trends. The influence of Hollywood on California&#x27;s fashion industry is evident in the manner in which these trends influence the collections of local designers and labels, who frequently strive to imitate these styles in their own lines. 2. Celebrity Endorsements: When it comes to product promotion, celebrities wield considerable sway. When a Hollywood celebrity endorses a fashion brand, the label gains international recognition. These endorsements can significantly increase the brand&#x27;s visibility and sales. In addition, celebrities frequently collaborate with fashion brands to launch their own collections, lending their name and style to the brand and thereby increasing its demand. 3. Celebrity Designers: Numerous Hollywood celebrities have launched their own apparel lines, ranging from casual to high fashion. Victoria Beckham, &#x27;The Row&#x27; by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and Rihanna&#x27;s Fenty are notable examples. These businesses have made significant contributions to California&#x27;s fashion industry. 4. Film-Inspired Fashion: Films and television series set in particular eras frequently reignite interest in the fashion trends of those eras. For instance, \"Mad Men\" popularised the style of the 1960s, while \"The Great Gatsby\" revived bohemian fashion from the 1920s. This has an effect on local designers who incorporate these fashions into their collections. 5. Costume Design: Through costume design in film and television, Hollywood has a significant impact on fashion. Costume designers such as Edith Head, Ruth E. Carter, and Sandy Powell have had an enduring impact on fashion, influencing trends well beyond the realm of film. 6. Hollywood Stylists: Hollywood stylists work behind the scenes to create styles for celebrities and have a significant impact on fashion trends.

Judge Beryl Howell issued a default judgment ordering the former Donald Trump attorney to pay nearly $133,000 in sanctions. In a 57-page opinion , Howell admonished Giuliani\u2019s failure to turn over the documents as \u201cwillful discovery misconduct.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, he has made the calculation that his overall litigation risks are minimized by not complying with his discovery obligations in this case,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cWhatever the reason, obligations are case specific and withholding required discovery in this case has consequences.\u201d Rudy Giuliani is seen outside the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta on Aug. 23. The former Donald Trump attorney was one of 19 people arrested last week after being accused of conspiring to change the results in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Fulton County election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss sued Giuliani in December 2021 after he claimed that the mother and daughter had helped commit supposed election fraud during the 2020 presidential race. Giuliani conceded in a court filing earlier this year that he had made false statements against the pair, which he said were \u201cdefamatory per se.\u201d Still, he argued that his statements were constitutionally protected. The sanctions ordered by the judge must be paid by Sept. 20. They will cover legal fees that the women incurred while attempting to obtain financial documents and information related to Giuliani\u2019s \u201cCommon Sense\u201d podcast, Howell ruled. The case will next go to trial to determine any damages in the case. Giuliani will again be given an opportunity to compel with discovery relevant to the determination of damages. If he does not comply, he faces additional discovery-related sanctions, noted the judge. Giuliani must also hand over the financial documents that the women previously requested, which he was ordered to produce in June.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Rudy Giuliani Now Admits He Made False Statements About Georgia Poll Workers After 2020 Election\ndate: 2023-07-26\nbody: As part of a push to convince Americans that Georgia's vote count was fraudulent, Giuliani publicized a video that purported to show election workers bringing in suitcases of false ballots for Biden Rudy Giuliani now admits that he made false and defamatory statements about two Georgia poll workers following Donald Trump 's loss in the 2020 presidential election. In a document filed late Tuesday in Washington, D.C. , the former New York City mayor says he no longer contests the accusations from the elections workers who are suing him \u2014 Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss \u2014 after he publicly accused them of rigging the vote in Georgia for Joe Biden . From the filing: \u201cDefendant Giuliani concedes solely for the purposes of this litigation \u2026 that [he] made the statements of and concerning plaintiffs. He does not dispute for the purposes of this litigation, that the statements carry meaning that is defamatory per se.\u201d After Trump lost the popular vote in Georgia \u2014 which has historically been a reliably red state \u2014 to Biden, he and his allies almost immediately began to pin the loss on fraud, all while pressuring officials there to \"find\" votes in his favor. Related: What to Know About the Georgia Grand Jury Subpoenaing Trump Allies, Including Rudy Giuliani and Lindsey Graham As part of that push to convince the American public that the vote was rigged, Giuliani publicized a video \u2014 which was also cited by Trump himself \u2014 that purports to show election workers bringing suitcases of false ballots for Biden into the State Farm Arena, then running them through the machines multiple times. But the reality was far less nefarious, with state investigators who reviewed the surveillance tapes saying the \"suitcases\" were just the standard ballot containers issued by the county, and the election officials were just undertaking \" normal ballot processing .\" Related: Ga. Poll Workers Testify at Jan. 6 Capitol Riot Hearing About Living in Fear Since 2020 Election Freeman and Moss testified before the Jan. 6 House Select committee in June 2022, detailing the treats they had received after Giuliani publicized the video. \"A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that I'll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, 'Be glad it's 2020 and not 1920.' A lot of them were racist, a lot of them were hateful,\" Moss, who had worked as an elections worker for over 10 years, said. In addition to the lawsuit brought by Freeman and Moss, Giuliani is at least one of the subjects of a Georgia special grand jury probe into attempts to overturn the state's 2020 election results for Trump. A subpoena issued to Giuliani in 2022 notes that he appeared before the Georgia state Senate in December 2020 and made \"statements, both to the public and in subsequent legislative hearings, claiming widespread voter fraud in Georgia during the November 2020 election and using the now-debunked State Farm Video in support of those statements.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

The NPR-PBS News Hour-Marist poll found that nearly two in three Americans \u2014 or roughly 65 percent \u2014 say the government should publicly support Israel. About 23 percent said the U.S. should say or do nothing related to the conflict, and 8 percent say the U.S. should publicly criticize Israel. Partisanship did not seem to play much of a role in the results, either, according to the poll. Around 77 percent of Republicans, 69 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of independents said they believe the U.S. should show public support for Israel amid the war. \u201cIsrael is clearly winning in the court of public opinion,\u201d Lee M. Miringoff, director of Maris College Institute for Public Opinion said in a statement. More than half of Americans also think U.S. support for Israel makes the Middle East safer. This comes as a majority of respondents said they were \u201cconcerned\u201d or \u201cvery concerned\u201d that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could lead to a larger conflict in the Middle East, according to the poll. Top Stories from The Hill A chilling account of death and survival in Israel: \u2018There\u2019s nobody to rescue anymore\u2019 Judge penalizes Giuliani for \u2018continued and flagrant\u2019 disregard of court order in 5-page ruling Biden\u2019s Israel response creates sharp contrast with Trump Iranian oil faces scrutiny amid Israel-Hamas conflict Forty-four percent of those surveyed think the Israel Defense Force\u2019s (IDF) response to Saturday\u2019s surprise attacks was appropriate. About a quarter of respondents, or roughly 26 percent, believe the response was \u201ctoo much\u201d and 27 percent say it has been \u201ctoo little,\u201d the survey found. Republicans are three times more likely (39 percent) than Democrats (13 percent) to say the Israeli military response wasn\u2019t strong enough, the survey results show. The poll also found that Democrats and Republicans are largely split along party lines in opinions on President Biden\u2019s response to the violence. Overall, 52 percent of respondents don\u2019t approve of Biden\u2019s response \u2014 19 percent of them being Democrats and 80 percent being Republicans. Less than half of those surveyed said they do approve of how Biden is handling the war, including 77 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans.

Results from The Associated Press-NORC Research Center survey , published Saturday, show 63 percent of U.S. adults believe Biden\u2019s handling of foreign business dealings with his son are unethical or illegal \u2014 33 percent unethical, 30 percent illegal respectively. Just 30 percent of the public said Biden did \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d according to the survey. When broken down by political party the divide is much wider. Republicans are more likely (65 percent) to say the president acted illegally in his business relationship with Hunter Biden. Only 8 percent of Democrats said the same. More Democrats (32 percent) than Republicans (31 percent), however, said they believed Biden acted \u201cunethically,\u201d but not \u201cillegally.\u201d Top Stories from The Hill A chilling account of death and survival in Israel: \u2018There\u2019s nobody to rescue anymore\u2019 Judge penalizes Giuliani for \u2018continued and flagrant\u2019 disregard of court order in 5-page ruling Biden\u2019s Israel response creates sharp contrast with Trump Iranian oil faces scrutiny amid Israel-Hamas conflict Fifty-eight percent of Democrats said the sitting president has \u201cnot done anything wrong.\u201d Only 3 percent of Republican respondents felt the same way.

The Department of the Interior (DOI) issued a congressionally-mandated five-year offshore oil lease plan last month that included just three fossil fuel lease sales through 2029. However, the IRA, Democrats' climate and tax bill passed in August 2022, prohibits the DOI from issuing an offshore wind development lease unless the agency has offered at least 60 million acres for offshore oil and gas leasing at some point in the previous 12 months. \"It's constructively a time of moratorium on the issuance of offshore wind leases in those gap years. We recognized that as soon as they came out with the leasing program,\" Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"We were a bit surprised that they wouldn't do oil and gas lease sales annually because annual sales are needed if they want to have uninterrupted wind lease sales in the offshore.\" \"Needless to say, there is a lot of uncertainty with regard to both offshore oil and gas lease sales and offshore wind lease sales over the next five to 10 years,\" he continued. \"If you have gaps in lease sales, then you have fewer opportunities for companies to bring forward projects and bring offshore wind power online, so it would be more likely to have a detrimental effect on the administration meeting its goals.\" OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PERMITTING PLUMMETS TO 2-DECADE LOW UNDER BIDEN Because of the IRA's provision tethering future offshore fossil fuel leases to future offshore wind leases, the DOI's five-year plan \u2014 which includes three fossil fuel lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico in November 2025, November 2027 and November 2029, respectively \u2014 indirectly creates three one-year periods in 2025, 2027 and 2029 where the federal government would be prohibited from holding wind lease sales.

But McConnell's latest remarks come as he faces pressure among fellow Republicans, including new House Speaker Mike Johnson, to focus on the situation in Israel separately. \"This is a moment for swift and decisive action to prevent further loss of life and impose real consequences on the powers that have terrorized the people of Ukraine and Israel,\" he said at the University of Louisville. \"Right now, the Senate has a chance to produce supplemental assistance that will help us do exactly that.\" The Kentucky senator was speaking alongside Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, who was his guest at the McConnell Center speaker series at U of L. Markarova urged the U.S. for financial support, referencing a 1941 Winston Churchill speech: \"Give me the tools and I will finish the job,\" she said. The multibillion-dollar aid package would tie U.S. border security financing and foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan together in one congressional bundle. \"Right now our efforts are making a difference up in Ukraine and here at home, but the Biden administration's hesitation along the way has really, in my view, prolonged the bloodshed,\" McConnell said. In his speech, he cast the situation as a global, Cold War-style fight for democracy. \"Think of it as an axis of evil: China, Russia and Iran,\" McConnell said. \"So this is not just a test for Ukraine. It is a test for the United States and from the free world. And the path toward greater security for all of us is simple: Help Ukraine win the war.\" His call to action was met with thunderous applause from the crowd, which included Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, his wife Rachel Greenberg and state Reps. Suzanne Miles, Emily Callaway and Susan Tyler Witten. McConnell and Markarova said the war in Ukraine is about preventing the spread of conflict. \"We have to stay the course,\" Marakarova said. \"Please stand a little bit longer with us.\" But some House Republicans have plans to push a stand-alone aid bill to Israel this week, Johnson said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \"We believe that is a pressing and urgent need,\" he\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: White House warns Biden would veto House appropriations measures\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: The White House on Monday issued veto threats against two GOP-led House appropriations bills expected to come up for a vote this week as lawmakers seek to avoid a government shutdown in November. The administration expressed its opposition to two funding bills likely to come up on the House floor in the coming days \u2014 one that would fund the Department of the Interior, Environment and related agencies, and another that would fund the Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and related agencies. The House bills would cut Department of Transportation funding by $7 billion compared to fiscal 2023 levels, $1.2 billion from HUD funding compared to 2023 levels, and nearly $4 billion from EPA funding compared to 2023 levels. If either bill made it to President Biden\u2019s desk, he would veto them, the White House said. Both pieces of legislation would need to make it through the GOP-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate. In both cases, the White House argued the bills put forward by Republicans in the House undercut an agreement reached by administration officials and GOP lawmakers in May on spending as part of negotiations to raise the debt limit. \u201cHouse Republicans had an opportunity to engage in a productive, bipartisan appropriations process, but instead are wasting time with partisan bills that cut domestic spending to levels well below the [Fiscal Responsibility Act] agreement and endanger critical services for the American people,\u201d the White House said. \u201cThese levels would result in deep cuts to clean energy programs and other programs that work to combat climate change, essential nutrition services, law enforcement, consumer safety, education, and healthcare.\u201d The White House veto threats come as lawmakers face a Nov. 17 government funding deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who was elected to the post last week, has said he wants to make as much progress as possible on the full slate of spending measures ahead of the looming deadline, even though a short-term funding patch will more than likely be needed to keep the government funded beyond Nov. 17. The House has passed only five of 12 appropriations bills, while the Senate has approved none. The Senate this week will continue voting on amendments to the appropriations \u201cminibus,\u201d with hopes of wrapping up consideration of the package this week. The package includes legislation funding military construction and the departments of Veterans Affairs; Agriculture; Transportation; and Housing and Urban Development.

Monday\u2019s \u201cHallo-READ!\u201d event featured book giveaways and story readings by the first lady, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and authors. The first lady showed her spirit by sporting feline ears, a tail and a black nose. She said she dressed as her cat, Willow. \u201cGo have fun and eat lots of candy,\u201d she told a group of costumed children after she read \u201cTen Spooky Pumpkins,\u201d a counting book. Jean-Pierre donned a halo and angel wings, saying she chose that over a devil costume. After she finished reading, the president and first lady spent about 90 minutes welcoming children from local public schools and from military families, who were invited. As the costume-clad kids walked up along the driveway, Biden dropped M&M\u2019s or Hershey\u2019s Kisses in little boxes stamped with the presidential seal into their bags or buckets. The first lady handed out books. Jill Biden, who is a lifelong teacher, came up with the \u201cHallow-READ!\u201d theme and a decor featuring famous literary characters, ghoulish tales and ghost story time, the White House said. A military band played instrumental versions of \u201cThriller,\u201d \u201cMonster Mash,\u201d and other songs. Some 8,000 guests were expected, the White House said. Numerous federal government departments and agencies participated, many with booths dotting the south grounds that were stocked with all types of chocolate candy and other sugary treats provided by the National Confectioners Association and its member companies.

The figures, recently disclosed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), are both astonishing and alarming, underscoring the challenges of securing the nation's borders. As anticipated, the DHS chose to unveil these numbers on a weekend, specifically on a Saturday, in a move seemingly aimed at minimizing public attention. According to a report by Fox News on Monday, October 30, 2023, this departure from previous practices signals an awareness within the administration that its immigration policies are not yielding the desired results and may be viewed unfavorably by the American public. A comprehensive examination of Total Nationwide Encounters (TNWE) paints a disconcerting picture that aligns with the concerns voiced by many over the past couple of years. These figures substantiate the claim that the administration's approach has effectively allowed the unhindered flow of unauthorized migration into the United States. It is worth emphasizing the use of TNWE rather than just the southwestern border numbers, as it highlights a crucial aspect of the administration's immigration strategy. The Biden administration has sought to obfuscate the magnitude of this issue by diverting attention from the southern border and, instead, facilitating the transit of large numbers of undocumented individuals through various ports of entry. These movements have been branded as \"legal pathways,\" but it is vital to clarify that these designations do not make these migrations legal by definition. The administration's failures in this regard extend beyond the southern border. Notably, they have allowed thousands of individuals to enter the United States through major airports. It is essential to ensure transparency in assessing the situation and holding the administration accountable for the implications of its immigration policies. The release of these fiscal year 2023 numbers underscores the need for a thorough and honest evaluation of the immigration challenges facing the United States. The administration's attempts to divert attention from the magnitude of the issue and its preference for labeling mass migrations as \"legal pathways\" are called into question. The American public deserves a clear understanding of the situation, which can only be achieved through open dialogue and a commitment to addressing the real issues at hand. As the nation grapples with the repercussions of these policies, it is crucial to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and work toward comprehensive solutions that prioritize national security and the well-being of all those residing within the United States.

Leave was canceled for police officers in several of the cities, with security heightened around sites such as synagogues, schools and the Israeli embassy in Washington. A heavy law enforcement presence greeted protesters gathering in New York City\u2019s Times Square on Friday for a rally in support of the Palestinian people. The late-afternoon event was peaceful. But earlier in the day, a city council member was arrested for bringing a handgun to a student demonstration supporting Palestinians near Brooklyn College. Inna Vernikov, a Republican who is Jewish, described pro-Palestinian protesters as \u201cterrorists\u201d while accusing them of making Jewish students feel unsafe. She was seen at the event with a pistol in her waistband, police said. American college campuses have become a flashpoint in recent days with groups of pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters confronting each other.

The increased state of alert follows the deadly attack by Hamas on southern Israel last Saturday and the subsequent retaliatory destruction of parts of Gaza by Israeli forces that has killed several thousand Israeli and Palestinian civilians. Israel\u2019s military has ordered the population of northern Gaza , numbering more than 1 million people, to evacuate before an expected ground invasion, a task that the United Nations has said would be \u201cimpossible without devastating humanitarian consequences\u201d. Hamas has told people to stay put in defiance, in a desperately dangerous and tense situation.

Hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets this weekend. Tens of thousands of protesters flooded the streets of London, New York City, and San Francisco. Hundreds of thousands of Pro-Palestinian protesters across the world have staged demonstrations in the last several days. Cities across the world saw large protests this weekend after the Israel Defense Forces launched expanded military operations in Gaza on Saturday. The IDF said Sunday its forces had struck more than 450 targets over the weekend, The Associated Press reported. The ground invasion finally came after weeks of Israeli airstrikes, which it launched on Gaza following a series of surprise attacks on Israel by Hamas, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, on October 7. Hamas' attacks killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. Militants also kidnapped an estimated 100-200 people. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Israel's counter-attacks have so far killed more than 8,000 people in Gaza and that about 3,000 have been children. The median age in Gaza is 18. Global antiwar protests are spreading as the conflict drags on. Organizers in the United States say they are planning a march on Washington, DC, on November 4, according to an announcement from several organizing groups. The protest will advocate for a cease-fire and call on President Joe Biden to end US aid to Israel. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that the conflict, which it has described as a mission to fully eradicate Hamas, would be a long one. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in London on Saturday to demand a ceasefire Local police said about 70,000 protesters joined the demonstration on Saturday, according to the BBC, while organizers with the Palestine Solidarity Committee estimated about 500,000 attendees. Police arrested nine people, the BBC reported. It was the second weekend in a row that London saw large-scale antiwar protests.

Since Saturday, at least four people \u2014 including a policeman \u2014 were killed and hundreds injured after clashes erupted during anti-government protests. At least 1,000 people were arrested \u2014 among them, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, a key opposition figure from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which called for Saturday\u2019s rally. Protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the transfer of power to a non-partisan caretaker government to oversee the general elections. Zia\u2019s party called for a nationwide strike Sunday and later called for three days of road and transportation blockades starting Tuesday across the country to protest police action and arrests of their supporters. Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior leader in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, said in an online press conference Monday that the blockade was to protest mass arrests and also to isolate Dhaka from the rest of the country so the opposition\u2019s demands were met. Leaders of the ruling party criticized the call for a blockade, saying their supporters would also be on the streets. \u201cThey (Bangladesh Nationalist Party) don\u2019t believe in Bangladesh and the constitution, and they don\u2019t obey the law and justice system,\u201d Quamrul Islam, a presidium member of the ruling party, told the rally. \u201cThere can be no compromise or dialogue with them.\u201d Also on Monday, the Election Commission held a meeting with top officials from various security agencies. \u201cIntelligence reports and the heads of law enforcement agencies said in the meeting that there are no big obstacles to organizing the coming elections,\u201d Jahangir Alam, secretary of the commission, told reporters after the meeting in Dhaka.

They\u2019re protesting the government\u2019s approval of a renegotiated contract with a Canadian mining firm for the operation of Central America\u2019s largest open-pit copper mine. They say it\u2019s a threat to the environment and an attack on Panama\u2019s sovereignty. Political analysts say the issue is having such an impact, because of the country\u2019s long history of foreign intervention in the country, and particularly the US control over the Panama Canal, which lasted throughout the 20th Century.

Unions on strike. School and university classes canceled. Workers. Teachers. Indigenous groups are in the streets. They\u2019re protesting the government\u2019s approval of a renegotiated contract with a Canadian mining firm for the operation of Central America\u2019s largest open-pit copper mine. It\u2019s a massive land concession, almost the size of the city of Miami. They say it\u2019s a handout to a foreign company. An attack on Panama\u2019s sovereignty. And a threat to the environment.

The protesters were demanding that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina step down to allow for a free and fair election under a neutral government. The clashes, which unfolded in central Dhaka, underscore the deep-seated divisions in the country's political landscape. Police estimated more than 125,000 supporters from two prominent opposition parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, rallied to voice their demands. A VOA reporter near the rally witnessed hundreds of people running for safety as sound grenades detonated, enveloping the streets in plumes of smoke. The violence spread around the protest site, as police fired tear gas and rubber shotgun rounds, while protesters retaliated by throwing stones and bricks. Bangladesh Police spokesperson AKM Kamrul Ahsan told VOA that at least one member from the police force was killed, and dozens of others were injured during the clashes. \"The police member who was hacked in the head died after being taken to the hospital,\" he said. Several individuals injured during the clashes were rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the country's largest, with wounds from rubber bullets. 'We call for calm' The United States condemned the political violence that unfolded in Dhaka on Saturday afternoon. \"We call for calm and restraint on all sides and will review all violent incidents for possible visa restrictions,\" said Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. In May, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the implementation of a new U.S. policy that allows the restriction of visas to individuals from Bangladesh who are found to undermine the country's democratic election process. The leading opposition party, BNP, alongside its former ally, the country's largest Islamist party Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, organized the \"grand rallies\" in the capital with a singular objective: to call for the resignation of the prime minister's government. They maintain she should relinquish her position to allow for an impartial caretaker administration to manage the upcoming polls scheduled for January.

Bribery, cronyism, nepotism and the influence of dark money has led to a distortion of seemingly everything from policymaking, to the integrity of our institutions, to the deterioration of public trust, the very currency that our politicians seem to take for granted. Take Senator Robert Menendez from the state of New Jersey, for example, and see how the power of politicians has become so abused that they can steal and take bribes with little to no repercussions. A man who has previously averted conviction on prior bribery charges in 2017 is now being prosecuted again for similar crimes due to his blatant and grotesque corruption of the power he has accumulated as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. This, however, is not the first time that a politician in the Democratic Party has done a salacious and unspeakable act that will eventually force them out of public office. Remember Anthony Weiner, the representative who in 2011 had to resign in shame due to engaging in inappropriate online relations with several women? How about former two term governor of New York City Andrew Cuomo? He stepped down due to the detailed allegations made against him by the state attorney general's office, with evidence pointing to how Cuomo had groped numerous women. Both parties have been involved in numerous amounts of corruption and scandal that has led to the disdain that many Americans now feel for their politicians around the country. Let us not forget that the former president of the United States has been indicted four times with ongoing criminal investigations that have amounted to 91 criminal charges, both federal and state. For far too long these individuals, who are supposed to represent us as the people of this country, have gotten away with crime after crime with no repercussions. There is a difference, some may even say, fundamentally, between playing the political game in which those in power must grease the wheels to continue to build and keep our country moving and the blatant and disrespectful disregard for the integrity of our political system. When will it end? When can we have the trust in our politicians that they're supposed to fight for?

The Rastriya Swatantra Party ran in the most recent general election with the overarching goal of maintaining countrywide law and order and restoring good governance by eliminating corruption. Frustrated voters who were fed up with the previous political parties supported the party, and it won a sizable number of seats in parliament. But this party is raising an issue with minor crimes rather than speaking out against major wrongdoings and scandals. The party isn\u2019t actually expressing concern about the fictitious Bhutanese scam and other numerous big scandals, but It\u2019s interesting to look closely at the gold smuggling scandal. The party, which is a recent addition to the political scene, still claims it will fight corruption and promote good administration. Despite what the party claims, the party is fully aware of this bank matter, but it is still silent on the Capital Merchant Bank scandal. Even the party\u2019s chairman and his allies have an extraordinary relationship with the high-ranking officials of the regulatory bank who were part of the Capital Merchant Bank scam. Before entering politics, the Party Chairman and his colleagues worked in the media and were fully aware of the capital Merchant bank scam\u2019s status. Even after taking power, the party and their MPs were made aware of the situation through a variety of channels, but they have remained utterly silent. Similar to the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, another young leader from the pro-monarchy party, who serves as chief whip, who is very critical to the government, but he also avoids discussing bank fraud in either the parliament or the committee (Finance) where he holds a member position. Among the established parties, the major opposition party, Nepal Communist Party (UML) is held accountable for significant numbers of scandals in Nepal. The opposition party leaders are furious because some of them are being investigated by the authorities for a number of serious scandals, but all know they will come out innocent regardless since most of the key constitutional bodies in the nation are dominated by Party cadres and their cadres are in the important roles. The Lalita Niwas scam, one of the largest scandals, is being investigated, but the opposition party leader who once served as finance minister is defending the main suspect who started the\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Calling Michigan GOP leaders criminal masterminds is only half right\ndate: 2023-10-22\nbody: Republicans, including and maybe especially those in Michigan, have an innovative and creative strategy: Do so many illegal and unethical things that people can\u2019t possibly keep track of them; today\u2019s outrage will obscure those of the past even as it fades away when inevitable new scandals come to light. To be fair, neither major party has a monopoly on shady and criminal behavior. U.S. Senator Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey and, perhaps, ultimately a federal prison cell) is but one example. Just last week people could be forgiven if they heard about a Trump lawyer pleading guilty for scheming to tamper with the 2016 presidential vote results in Georgia. Didn\u2019t they just do that story? No, that was Sidney Powell. This one is about Kenneth Chesebro. These are serious racketeering charges and they are lodged against Trump attorneys not named Rudy Giuliani. Meanwhile, there is the ex-president and current Republican front runner who has, at last count, 91 felony charges lodged against him. A new record, as breathless sports announcers might say. Since Republicans act that way on the national scale, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that when it comes to sleazy antics from elected Michigan leaders, the state\u2019s Republican Party has carved out a consistently illicit profile. Speaking of new records, Republicans Rick Johnson and Lee Chatfield reached a new low-water mark when they became the first-ever former Michigan House speakers to simultaneously be under criminal investigation. The cases, while separate, each involve money and sex. Shocking, I know. Johnson\u2019s alleged crimes are no longer alleged. He has pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 55 months in federal prison for accepting at least $110,000 in bribes as well as sexual favors paid for by lobbyists in return for non-sexual favors he doled outin his post-speaker role as chair of the state\u2019s now defunct marijuana licensing board. \u201cI am a corrupt politician,\u201d said Johnson, who is also a master of redundancy. Chatfield has maintained his innocence. The youngest speaker in state history, he has been accused of forcing sex with a girl (who later became his sister-in-law) in a relationship that she alleges began when she was either 15 or 16 and he was a teacher at a Chrisitan school. He\u2019s also the focus of investigations for embezzlement, b\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Breaking political news, plotted by complexity and normalcy\ndate: 2023-10-27\nbody: Confusing and Unprecedented Robert Menendez facing allegations of bribery and acting as a foreign agent N.J. Sen. Robert Menendez, Chairman and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his wife Nadine, are facing allegations of bribery in an indictment. Menendez is accused of using his position to aid the Egyptian government, pressure prosecutors to drop a case against his friend and exhibit other acts of corruption, according to AP News on Sept. 26. Menendez has since stepped down from his position as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but has called the claims against him false. Additionally, Menendez and his wife were accused of acting as foreign agents, according to an Oct. 12 New York Times article. His prosecutors claim that despite his position, he acted on behalf of Egypt. \u2014G. A. Donald Trump indicted on multiple fraud charges The state of New York charged former president Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records, and Georgia charged him with 13 counts in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. If found guilty, he could still run in the presidential election. Over the past year, Trump has faced four different indictments and 91 felony charges. Two federal grand juries have filed charges, one on accusations that he hoarded national defense documents after leaving office, and the other on accusations of probing and interfering with the results of the 2020 election. \u2014B. C. Straightforward and Unprecedented Kevin McCarthy removed as Speaker of the House Speaker of the House of Representatives, California Republican Kevin McCarthy, was voted out of the House on Oct. 3. This historic move occurred after he reached a short-term spending deal with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown. Because of this move, conservative hardliner Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) acted to force a vote to vacate McCarthy. In the past, speakers have stepped down from the position after losing party support, but McCarthy is the first to be voted out. \u2014S. R. More familiar and confusing Hunter Biden indicted on charges of firearm possession In September, Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, was indicted on charges of illegal firearm possession while using drugs.

Armstrong is facing a first-degree murder charge in relation to the killing of professional cyclist Anna Moriah \"Mo\" Wilson. She is accused of shooting \"Mo\" Wilson at a home in East Austin on May 11, 2022, after discovering Wilson and Armstrong's then-boyfriend had spent the day together. Armstrong\u2019s legal team and state prosecutors spoke with 100 potential jurors on Monday. Presenting the state\u2019s side were Guillermo Gonzalez, Ricky Jones, and Jean Sullivan. Armstrong is being represented by Geoffrey Puryear, Rick Cofer, and Elizabeth Duggan. The attorneys walked the jurors through hypothetical situations and asked questions about the juror\u2019s opinions. For example, the state asked if jurors understood what intent means in the trial setting, and whether they would be able to return a guilty verdict if they deemed the state had proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt entirely on circumstantial evidence. Gonzalez brought forward several other questions about indirect and direct evidence and reasonable doubt. The defense asked each juror how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements such as: If the police charge a person with committing murder, the person is probably guilty A person who knows she is accused of murder should testify in her own defense The jurors had a mixed reaction to both questions. The defense also asked whether the jurors could be impartial after the pre-trial publicity this case has received. The event made national headlines at the time, both for the details of the case and the surrounding circumstances of Armstrong\u2019s flee to Costa Rica. Criminal defense attorney Amber Vasquez, who is unaffiliated with the case, spoke about that with CBS Austin recently. \"It's high profile because it is very attractive people involved in a love triangle and a beautiful, young woman who runs off to an exotic land. That's why it's high profile. Not because of anything specific about the case itself, or because of necessarily the people in it,\u201d said Vasquez. Vazquez also said it's rare that a murder case is quickly put on trial, but the defense has really pushed to make that happen. Vazquez said it's a unique case for several reasons, \"I have murder cases going to trial from 3 years ago at this point and this one is a newer case. It's also unique because of the defendant.

Individuals and companies are finding that they can apply the lens of sustainability to virtually any part of their operations \u2014 from the raw materials used to make products to how those products are packed for shipping to handling the waste that comes from unsold food. Retail TouchPoints has identified five recent examples of sustainability in action: 1. Seeking a Double Benefit: Capturing Carbon to Create Raw Materials Trees \u201ceat\u201d carbon dioxide and turn it into the cellulose they need to grow (which is one of the reasons deforestation presents such an enormous challenge to sustainability). Rubi Laboratories is seeking to mimic this natural process in the lab, and it has partnered with Walmart to pilot technology that captures carbon at the retailer\u2019s facilities and turns it into fibers that could be used to create what would be the ultimate in sustainable apparel \u2014 garments that would effectively be not just carbon-neutral but carbon-negative. At this point, the pilot is testing whether the Rubi technology could be integrated at a larger scale in the Walmart supply chain with the effective capture of carbon emissions. Simultaneously, a brand pilot will be testing the fiber\u2019s performance in a prototype garment, with the goal of producing garment samples and, if successful, a larger apparel collection that would be sold in Walmart stores. 2. Growing Crops Using More Earth-Friendly Methods Another Walmart initiative addressing sustainability at the very beginning of product lifecycles is the retailer\u2019s recently launched collaboration with PepsiCo. The two corporate giants will invest $120 million over seven years to establish and scale financial, agronomic and social programs designed to accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland in the U.S. and Canada. The goal is to deliver approximately 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals by 2030 \u2014 roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity needed to power nearly 780,000 homes for one year. \u201cFarmers know their business better than anyone else, and what we hear from them is that for regenerative agriculture to make business sense, three things need to happen,\u201d said Jim Andrew, Chief Sustainability Officer at PepsiCo in a statement. \u201cThey need economic support, social and cultural support, and agronomic support. This strategic collaboration with Walmart will advance our shared goal to have farmers\u2019 backs as\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Walmart\u2019s chief sustainability officer talks ESG priorities, challenges\ndate: 2023-09-29\nbody: As Walmart chips away at its environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, the retailer is well aware it occupies a global spotlight and that investors, employees and customers are watching closely, the company\u2019s sustainability head said at a recent investment firm event. Due to its size and scale, Walmart sees itself in a prime spot to be a role model for other businesses on the ESG front, Kathleen McLaughlin, executive vice president and chief sustainability officer at the retailer, said Wednesday during the 2023 Goldman Sachs Global Sustainability Forum. \u201cAs a big retailer, how do we shift consumption toward a more circular approach not only in packaging and things like that, but the materials themselves and products?\u201d said McLaughlin. But the retailer is also facing an increasingly politicized environment, data challenges and other headwinds, noted McLaughlin, who joined Walmart in 2013 after more than two decades at consulting firm McKinsey & Co. During the session, McLaughlin outlined Walmart\u2019s position on key ESG issues, described challenges the retailer is facing and pointed to areas where the company has made progress. Overarching approach Walmart has four key areas under its ESG efforts, McLaughlin said. They are: economic opportunities for its own workers and suppliers; enhancing the sustainability of its retail operations and supply chain; strengthening communities; and ethics and integrity as an international business, which includes \u201crole modeling standards\u201d around corporate governance and digital citizenship. During the past 15 years, there\u2019s been a shift with businesses moving from viewing these types of efforts as \u201cside projects\u201d under a \u201ccorporate social responsibility mindset\u201d to dedicating special projects as part of a holistic approach that factors these areas into the broader business strategy, McLaughlin said. Walmart tackles each of its four areas by first setting goals that factor in the business, societal and stakeholder perspectives, then determining the strategies and metrics to work toward the desired outcomes and finally disclosing its efforts, McLaughlin said. One of the marquee goals for Walmart is its pledge to achieve zero emissions across its global operations by 2040. McLaughlin said that goal is \u201ccentral to business success\u201d for Walmart. While there has been some backlash to ESG efforts by businesses as well as ongoing skepticism or denial of climate change, McLaughlin\u2019s comments defended Walmart\u2019s emphasis on ESG.

Through the agreement, the companies will divert non-edible food from landfills to instead create compost, feed animals and generate renewable energy. A Denali spokesperson noted that this announcement is the first time Walmart and Denali have made their partnership public. This announcement marks Walmart\u2019s latest effort to bolster its sustainability efforts after introducing a number of new initiatives in recent years. Dive Insight: The renewed agreement will help Walmart to achieve its waste diversion goal, according to a Denali spokesperson, as millions of pounds of food will go toward \u201cbeneficial uses.\u201d In its 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance report, Walmart stated it wanted to reduce operational food waste by 50% by 2030 and has already achieved approximately a 12% reduction as of the end of 2022. The retailer also has the goal of achieving zero waste to landfills and incineration in its Canada, Mexico and U.S. markets by 2025. For its U.S. operations, Walmart diverted 78% of its waste materials last year, per the report. The partnership builds on Walmart\u2019s efforts to move toward a circular economy, which involves putting focus on the reuse, recycling and regeneration of materials, the Denali spokesperson said. Both companies will continue to explore new strategies and tools to reduce food waste and support recycling, per the press release. Across its operations, Denali recycles over 10 billion pounds of organic materials annually with a significant portion coming from grocery retailers, according to the announcement. The company works with compost manufacturers, including its own network of two dozen compost facilities, to transform food waste, and works with local farms, where certain foods are used as animal feed. Denali also provides food waste to anaerobic digesters for the creation of renewable energy. The greenhouse gas mitigation impact of Denali\u2019s food waste recycling efforts is annually equal to taking around 100,000 cars off the road or providing electricity to over 60,000 homes for a year, the press release noted. This is not the first time Walmart has made strides to lessen its food waste. In March 2022, the retailer signed on to the Pacific Coast Food Waste Commitment,\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Walmart Renews Partnership With Denali; Todd Mathes Comments\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: RUSSELLVILLE, AR - Mitigating food waste is not just a hot topic\u2014it is a cornerstone of today\u2019s sustainability discussion. With this in mind, Walmart has extended a strategic partnership. It has renewed its agreement with Denali, which offers food waste recycling at 4,700 Walmart stores in the United States. making retail more sustainable,\u201d commented Todd Mathes, the Chief Executive Officer of Denali. \u201cDenali is proud to provide services that bring Walmart closer to its goal of zero waste in its U.S. operations by 2025.\u201d This collaboration allows Denali and Walmart to annually divert millions of pounds of food that is no longer edible away from landfills and toward beneficial uses such as creating compost, feeding animals, and generating renewable energy. Additionally, the duo will continue to explore new strategies and tools to reduce food waste and maximize the positive impacts of recycling. Denali works with compost manufacturers\u2014including its own network of 24 compost facilities\u2014to turn food waste into valuable soil amendments, a press release noted. The company also partners with local farms to supply certain types of food waste as feed for animals and provides food waste to anaerobic digesters for the creation of renewable energy. Throughout its operations, Denali recycles more than 10 billion pounds of organic materials each year\u2014a significant portion of which comes from grocery retailers like Walmart. The greenhouse gas mitigation impact of Denali\u2019s recycling food waste is equivalent to taking approximately 100,000 cars off the road or providing electricity to more than 60,000 homes for one year.

Each year for the past decade, Walmart has its Open Call event. During this time, the big box retailer hears pitches from selected American entrepreneurs about their products. If it's a success, entrepreneurs can sell their products on the shelves at Walmart stores and Sam's Club stores. Selling through Walmart exclusively online is also an option too. This year, Walmart heard from more than 700 businesses that presented over 1,000 products. The suppliers were present in all 50 states and traveled to Bentonville, Arkansas. So far, the company said it has given the golden ticket to 180 pitches. Plus, Walmart added that it will consider 470 products in the future for deals. \"Open Call is a key part of Walmart's 10-year, $350 billion investment in items made, grown or assembled in the U.S,\" John Furner, president and chief executive officer of Walmart's U.S team said. \"Investing in U.S. manufacturing is right for our customers and the country's economy, because it helps deliver our customers the goods they need, when they need them, at affordable prices, while it is expected to support the creation of more than 750,000 jobs.\u201d Some new products coming to Walmart include women's jeans maker Brilliant You Denim and dried fruit supplier Ugly Company, according to Forbes. The other brands that Walmart made a deal with were unclear. During Walmart's Open Call event last year, it added more than 330 products. The U.S. Sun has reached out to Walmart for further comment. MORE WALMART CHANGES But there are more Walmart changes that customers need to keep in mind. For example, a brand new shopping cart design in Mayfield, Kentucky debuted last month. However, they were meant by complaints from customers over their size. One Facebook user said: \u201cThe new Walmart shopping carts make me feel like a dwarf. But then again, I have no clue how a short person will push them?\u201d Also, Walmart is experimenting with artificial intelligence services. AI shopping assistant aims to help customers plan for an event such as decorating their home for the holidays or a birthday party. Also, it can help customers decide on a product to buy.

According to a criminal complaint, the Department of Justice said 43-year-old John Anthony Miller left several threatening voicemails for the office of a U.S. senator between Oct. 11 and Oct. 19. Fox News confirmed voicemails were left for Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who is Jewish. RENO MAN SENTENCED TO MORE THAN A DECADE BEHIND BARS AFTER FATAL CRASH INVOLVING MARIJUANA The criminal complaint said that on Oct. 17, Miller threatened to assault, kidnap, or even murder Rosen \u2014 who was not named in the complaint \u2014 with intent to impede, intimidate or interfere with her duties as a senator. The voicemails are filled with profanity and detailed in the criminal complaint . READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP For example, Miller said in one of the voicemails, \"All these [expletive]ing lies is in your [expletive]ing hands, you [expletive]ing [expletive], and I\u2019m gonna [expletive]ing see you soon, you [expletive]ing sellout [expletive]ing [expletive] [expletive].\" LAS VEGAS WOMAN ALLEGEDLY ROBS \u2018SUGAR DADDY\u2019 AFTER SIN CITY WEEKEND: REPORT The next day, Miller went to the Lloyd D. George Courthouse in Las Vegas and told officials he was going to see the U.S. senator and refused to cooperate with a court security guard. Ultimately, he was denied entry into the courthouse, became upset and started yelling and shouting profanities. On Oct. 19, Miller left more voicemails for Rosen, including one when he asked if the senator had any family members who were Israeli settlers , suggesting if she did, he was pretty sure she would not make it illegal for them to come back to the U.S. NEW BODYCAM VIDEO SHOWS TUPAC SHAKUR MURDER SUSPECT HYPING HIS ALLEGED CRIME \"...450 thousand of \u2018em are American and are able to co-commit war crimes and come back and forth.

The suspect was identified as Joseph Stephens Jenkins, 34. Jenkins was a transient and was recently released from state prison on parole for murder, Ione Police Chief John Alfred said. Ione police said officers were called to Violet Lane at around 8:44 a.m., then the suspect was seen fleeing toward Shakeley Lane. Jenkins was arrested along Shakeley Lane. \"It's definitely a little unnerving that it was so close,\" said Danielle Hendricks, who lives in the area. \"It makes me a little nervous.\" Police recovered a knife at the scene of the arrest. \"I heard the cops screaming at the suspect, 'Get on the ground, put your hands up, don't move,' \" Hendricks said. One person \u2013 an Ione resident \u2013 died at the scene while two other people were injured. PG&E confirmed to CBS13 that one of their workers was among those people injured, being stabbed on the job. The two surviving victims were hospitalized and were stable at last check. Ione police say this appears to be a random act of violence. Several locations along Shakeley Lane are being investigated. Neighbors told CBS13 that the suspect was breaking into homes and may have scoped out the street over the past few days. \"My kids' rooms are accessible to the street, so it is really scary,\" Hendricks said. She added that, in her community, \"this doesn't happen often. This isn't normal.\" Authorities are expected to release more details in a news conference at noon on Tuesday. Ione is about 40 miles southeast of Sacramento.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Man charged with murder after woman found dead in Eagan hotel room\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: EAGAN, Minn. \u2014 A little over three weeks after a woman was found dead in an Eagan hotel room, a Little Canada man was arrested and charged with her murder. The Dakota County Attorney's Office accused Philip Wong, 25, of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter in the Oct. 12 death of 53-year-old Jianqin Zhang. According to the criminal complaint filed Monday, Zhang was found bent over one of the beds in the hotel room, face down and cold to the touch just before midnight by a hotel employee and a \"concerned friend.\" When officers responded to the hotel, they found Zhang had been moved onto the floor so medics could perform life-saving efforts, but she was ultimately pronounced dead at the scene. During their investigation, authorities said they talked with the woman's friend, who told them Zhang was a sex worker. The friend said the woman's \"organization\" asked them to check on her when they hadn't \"heard from her in awhile.\" The \"organization\" allegedly told the friend that Zhang had met a client at the hotel around 3 p.m. on Oct. 12 and that the organization received a text from Zhang's phone at 3:39 p.m., saying the client had left. The complaint said \"numerous attempts\" to reach Zhang by the \"organization\" after 3:45 p.m. then went unanswered. Investigators later learned through Zhang's friend and hotel surveillance that Wong met Zhang at the hotel that afternoon just before 3 p.m. Prosecutors said that footage then showed Wong leaving the building at 3:48 p.m. Another witness \u2014 identified as a housekeeper at the hotel \u2014 also spoke with investigators, saying she entered the room with her keycard around 4:30 p.m. when Zhang didn't answer the door. But when she walked inside, she said she saw Zhang bent over the side of the bed and immediately exited the room, according to the complaint. In the wake of Zhang's death, authorities viewed keycard access to the room, which showed it was only entered three times on Oct. 12 \u2014 once at 4:41 p.m., coinciding with the housekeeper; once at 10:56 p.m., which coincided with another hotel employee; and lastly, at 11:56, coinciding with the hotel employee and friend who would eventually report the woman's condition to police. On Oct. 17, the complaint said a search warrant was executed at Wong's home. Prosecutors allege clothes matching the description of Wong's at the time of Zhang's death were collected, as well as a cell phone. During questioning, Wong allegedly told police he went\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Registered sex offender is a suspect in murder of visiting nurse in Willimantic: court docs\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: A man is suspected in the killing of his visiting nurse at a halfway house in Willimantic on Saturday, according to court documents obtained by NBC Connecticut. A woman who had been reported missing was found dead in the basement of a home at 106 Chapman St. That home is a part of a Re-Entry Assisted Community Housing (REACH) location in Willimantic. Michael Carlos Reese, 38, who lived at the halfway house, had an appointment with his visiting nurse that was only supposed to take eight minutes, documents show, but her location still pinged at the home hours later. Officers were contacted on Saturday around 2 p.m. by the family of a woman who had been missing and unaccounted for since the mid-morning hours. She was believed to be in Willimantic. When police went to Chapman Street to investigate, they determined the missing woman's vehicle was no longer in the area. Authorities said a patrol officer found the missing woman's vehicle at a business nearby. A police K9 followed a track from her vehicle back to the home where the woman was believed to be. According to documents, police obtained an arrest warrant for Reese, who is a registered sex offender \"with violent tendencies.\" He was staying at a halfway house in Willimantic and was on probation with an ankle monitor at the time of the incident, authorities said. Documents show that Reese's probation-issued ankle bracelet had been tampered with, with the last known location being his home, but responding officers said he wasn't there. Investigators at the home said Reese was seen fleeing the area. He had a knife on him, as well as debit and credit cards not belonging to him, police said. Reese was detained and was later arrested at the scene on unrelated charges. In the court documents for those unrelated charges, police say Reese is a suspect in the murder of the visiting nurse. He is being held on a bond set at a little over $1 million. He faces charges for violating probation, larceny and possession of drug paraphernalia. Documents show that Reese has a criminal history and has served time in prison for assault resulting in serious physical injury and other charges. Authorities say he completed a residential treatment program and transitioned to the Willimantic halfway house a couple of months ago. Inside of the halfway house, police said they found a woman dead in the basement. Her identity has not been released. Reese is currently at the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center. He was supposed to appear in court for his arraignment Monday, but officials deemed his mental health needs too high, saying he posed a safety risk to others. Authorities went on to say that Reese refused to take part in a virtual hearing, which is an uncommon occurrence.

Formella, State Police Colonel Mark B. Hall, and Conway Police Chief Christopher J. Mattei jointly announce a major development in the unsolved murder case of David Bruce Goodwin, a Conway, New Hampshire resident, whose life was tragically cut short in May 2016. A collaborative effort between the New Hampshire Cold Case Unit and the State Police Major Crime Unit has culminated in the arrest of Robert Dowling, a 51-year-old resident of Haverhill, Massachusetts. Dowling now faces a charge of Second Degree Murder in connection with the murder of Mr. Goodwin. The incident occurred on May 15, 2016, when Mr. Goodwin was brutally attacked inside his living quarters at the Conway Valley Inn in Conway, New Hampshire. Despite medical efforts, he succumbed to his injuries two days later. The autopsy revealed that the cause of Mr. Goodwin's death was blunt force trauma to the head, and it was officially ruled a homicide. Following the issuance of a warrant for Robert Dowling's arrest, he was apprehended in Massachusetts and charged with being a fugitive from justice. Currently, he is held without bail, pending an arraignment expected to take place at Essex County Superior Court (MA) as the court docket allows. Extradition proceedings to bring Dowling back to New Hampshire will soon follow. The successful arrest and detention of Mr. Dowling would not have been possible without the unwavering dedication and cooperation of various law enforcement agencies, including the Conway Police Department, the Massachusetts State Police, the Haverhill Police Department (MA), and the Essex County District Attorney\u2019s Office. It is essential to note that the charges and allegations against Robert Dowling are considered accusations, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. This breakthrough offers a glimmer of hope to bring closure to the unresolved case of David Bruce Goodwin, whose memory lives on in the pursuit of justice.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

After helping to support the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, she was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador in 2001. In 2006, she launched the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation with now-estranged husband Brad Pitt . The organization provides aid in alleviating extreme rural poverty, protecting the environment and conserving wildlife in rural northwestern Cambodia. The nonprofit is seemingly named after the twosome's son, Maddox, who was born there in 1995. Jolie previously told The Telegraph in 2012 why being charitable makes her feel good. \u201cWhat are we in this world if we can\u2019t be of use to others in some way,\u201d she explained at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a happier life. I had a wonderful mother and I learned a lot about women through her. I have great daughters who teach me a lot about the strength of women and little girls. And I\u2019ve met amazing people around the world who\u2019ve inspired me and taught me to be better.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 \u2019s charitable deeds have also not gone unnoticed. She even has a BET Humanitarian Award win and DoSomething.org\u2019s Most Charitable Celebrity title to prove her good will. Not only has the \u201cFormation\u201d singer used her platform to speak out against injustice and social issues , she has also founded BeyGOOD, a philanthropic initiative mission of economic equity and education.

While in conversation with #GayleKing for CBS Mornings, the legendary music mogul reflected on Beyonce and Blue Ivy\u2019s continuous work ethic. \u201cMy wife, I know how hard she works.\u201d Jay went on to reveal that the Renaissance world tour is his favorite so far. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s her best tour. It\u2019s hard to really compare them, because they all have their different things of genius,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut, this one to me felt like the \u201cmost complete.\u201d Jay continued by adding how Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s storytelling served as a full-circle moment for their family. \u201cOn top of it, how inclusive it was, and the story of her Uncle Johnny, and how everything just came about. Which goes from Johnny, the ancestors, to Blue.\u201d The proud father went on to applaud his eldest daughter\u2019s growth and her courage to perform in front of large audiences at a young age. \u201cAnd Blue, what makes me super proud and I still get goosebumps seeing her walk onstage, is \u2019cause Blue\u2019s been born into this world. She\u2019s been born into a life she didn\u2019t ask for.\u201d Jay continued, \u201cShe came up and sees 80,000 people. She\u2019s 11 so she\u2019s nervous. I know her, so I know how nervous she was, and I know how frightened she was.\u201d \u201cBut, she wanted to do it. She wanted to do it the first night, and we was like, \u2018Okay, if this is something you want to do, you can\u2019t just go out there. You got to go work with the dancers \u2026 And she worked every day. I watched her work hard. She had like a little icy pack thing on her back some days.\u201d\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: 10 Famous Singers from Texas\ndate: 2023-08-14\nbody: Texas, the \u201cLone Star State,\u201d is an iconic and vast state located in the southern United States.

Social media platforms didn\u2019t aid terrorism The next time you log in to your social media accounts, they\u2019ll probably look pretty much the same. That may not seem like news, but it wasn\u2019t always assured. Two similar First Amendment Supreme Court cases that were argued this term \u2013 Gonzalez v. Google LLC and Twitter Inc. v. Taamneh \u2013 could have resulted in drastic changes to the algorithms that social media platforms use to prioritize the content you\u2019re seeing. In the end, a unanimous ruling in the Twitter case effectively ended the Google case and sidestepped both the First Amendment and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. We never reached these key issues because the court said unanimously that neither platform aided and abetted international terrorism, which was the claim made by the families of two people who were killed by terrorist attacks. Justice Clarence Thomas said that Twitter (and Google) are akin to innocent bystanders \u2013 who, under the law, are not held liable just because they do not object to the wrongful acts they see \u2013 because their content suggestion algorithms treat terrorist content the same as all other content: passively and indifferently. So, the court did not need to decide whether Section 230 could defend Twitter or Google in its own case. These dual wins mean the platforms can maintain their current algorithms and also their current (and controversial) content moderation efforts. Platforms still won\u2019t be liable for decisions as to what content to retain or reject. Parody dog toy doesn\u2019t have First Amendment protection because of potential brand confusion This First Amendment Supreme Court case gave a clear win to Jack Daniel\u2019s and offered a bright line between trademark law and the First Amendment. The court ruled in Jack Daniel's Properties v. VIP Products that the only question here is whether there is a likelihood of confusion among consumers that the Bad Spaniels dog toy made by VIP Products could be made by Jack Daniel\u2019s, based on its similarity to the brand\u2019s actual products. This concept of \u201csource identification\u201d (who makes the product you want to buy) lies at the heart of trademark law and leaves no room for First Amendment protection in this case. First Amendment protection for art and expression gives way to consumer protection when consumers could be tricked or mistaken about a product\u2019s origin. On the other hand, Justice Elena Kagan cited artistic uses of a trademark where the First Amendment might apply, including the song \u201cBarbie Girl,\u201d which parodied the popular Mattel character, and a mention of Louis Vuitton in the movie \u201cThe Hangover II.\u201d In these instances, there is less likelihood that consumers might be tricked into believing there is a connection between the trademark holder and artistic user, so courts apply a standard called the Rogers test to determine the extent to which the First Amendment protects the artist.

Nearly three dozen appeals are on the argument docket. Several dozen more are expected to be added in coming months. The caseload is usually settled by February, with the term effectively ending in late June. Other important appeals that may be added to the court's calendar cover such issues as abortion medication, social media regulation, affirmative action in secondary school education, 2020 election interference prosecutions and other 2024 election disputes. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT COULD HELP US TAKE BACK OUR CITIES Important petitions already on the Supreme Court's argument docket : READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP Arguments Tuesday , Oct. 7 AT ISSUE: Major gun rights case challenging the constitutionality of a federal ban on gun possession by individuals subject to domestic violence restraining orders (DVROs). THE CASE: Zackey Rahimi, after being charged with separate state offenses in the alleged physical assault of his ex-girlfriend and another woman by use of firearms, pleaded guilty to a violation of federal law for later possessing a handgun despite an earlier restraining order. THE ARGUMENTS: This will be a key test of precedent from the high court's 2022 ruling expanding gun rights outside the home. The Biden administration says \"governments have long disarmed individuals who pose a threat to the safety of others.\" Rahimi's lawyers say the appeals court ruling striking down the DVRO ban was a \"faithful application\" of last year's high court decision.

Justices will consider the constitutionality of an entire federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Florida and Texas laws that impose government-mandated editorial policies on social media sites; and whether people subject to domestic violence restraining orders have a right to own a gun. The Supreme Court is also likely to take up lower-court decisions about whether to ban a drug used in more than half of all abortions in the United States and whether political activists have a First Amendment right to organize a protest. And it has already announced that it will hear a major gerrymandering suit, with more cases potentially coming that could decide who prevails in future elections.

Written by Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Berkeley School of Law, the book looks back at major cases addressed by the court and provides an informed focus on the implications of those decisions. Chemerinsky writes about the Supreme Court\u2019s profound reshaping with the appointments of justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, creating a solid six-justice conservative majority. This was seen in the October Term 2021 with the court\u2019s overturning Roe v. Wade and other significant rulings. The impact was felt again, Chemerinsky writes, in the last days of October Term 2022, with a series of 6-3 decisions, moving the law significantly to the right in restricting affirmative action by colleges and universities, creating a First Amendment exception to state anti-discrimination laws for those engaged in expressive activities, and invalidating President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program. There were also significant surprises from the conservative court, Chemerinsky writes, including rulings that rejected Alabama\u2019s new congressional districts, rejected the \"independent state legislature\" theory and upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 Subscribe to the Legal News!

Firefighters have been battling the blaze that has scorched the Queensland state town of Tara for more than a week. No new property losses were reported on Tuesday as crews sweltered in 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit) weather to reinforce containment lines established on Monday, Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Acting Superintendent Cameron Herbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fire that you can put out. We can\u2019t actually extinguish it, but we just need to control it,\u201d Herbert told reporters. Firefighting reinforcements from Victoria state and New Zealand were heading to the fire front this week to relieve weary locals. \u201cThe fatigue is definitely setting in,\u201d Herbert said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese flew to Queensland on Tuesday to pledge his support for wildfire victims. Police reported the charred body of a man had been found on the fire ground last week. Details of how he died have not been established. The tally of homes destroyed in Tara\u2019s surrounds had reached 53 by Monday and hundreds have been forced to flee. \u201cSome areas are still too hot to get into. Unfortunately we are expecting that number to go up,\u201d Western Downs Mayor Paul McVeigh said. There were about 70 fires burning across Queensland on Tuesday and nine in New South Wales to the south, which marks an early start to Australia's wildfire season that peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer. Albanese urged residents in the fire zone to monitor safety advice and avoid further tragedy. \u201cThese are heartbreaking scenes when people lose their houses,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThis is a difficult period, and it\u2019s going to be a difficult summer.\" Experts predict the approaching wildfire season will be the most destructive since the Black Summer fires of 2019-20 that killed 33 people, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and razed 19 million hectares (47 million acres). Those fires came at the end of 2019, which was Australia\u2019s hottest and driest year on second. Three successive La Nina weather patterns since then have brought wetter and milder summers. But a current El Nino weather event is bringing hotter and drier conditions to Australia\u2019s populous southeast.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Explosive wildfire season exposes vast training gaps among Louisiana firefighters\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: When firefighters rushed from across the state to battle a massive wildfire in Beauregard Parish, a firefighter from Texas noticed something unsettling about his Louisiana colleagues: most of them had no idea what they were doing. \u201cThey\u2019d say \u2018we\u2019re just going to go hit it,\u2019 and want to rush in,\u201d said Taylor Lott, a volunteer firefighter in Beauregard who trained in wildland firefighting in his home state. \u201cNo, in the conditions we\u2019re having and the fires we\u2019re having, you can\u2019t do that. There\u2019s just a lot they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d During the first days of the Tiger Island Fire, some firefighters wanted to race large trucks to the biggest flames and blast them with water, much as they would a house fire. That approach is not only ineffective and unrealistic \u2014 it could put firefighters at risk, wildland firefighting experts say. It defies basic wildland firefighting training. But that training \u2013 commonly called \u201cred card\u201d certification \u2013 hasn\u2019t been available in Louisiana. \u201cVery few have red cards in Louisiana, and nobody offers the training in the state,\u201d Charles \u2018Skip\u2019 Pinkston, president of the Louisiana Fire Chiefs Association, said in late August, during the height of the wildfire season. \u201cThe need for the training\u2019s been talked about many times, but it\u2019s never materialized.\u201d Tiger Island, the largest wildfire in Louisiana in at least 80 years, and the hundreds of other blazes that raged across the state in recent months should change that, said Kent Maxwell, a founder of Colorado Firecamp, a wildland firefighting school near Salida, Colo. \u201cSomebody in Louisiana is going to have to step up \u2013 either from the governor\u2019s office or because people are pushing from the bottom up,\u201d he said. That\u2019s starting to change, at least temporarily. The Louisiana State Fire Marshal\u2019s office recently announced a half-dozen one- and two-day wildland firefighting classes and a relatively small red card certification program that starts with an online course and ends with hands-on training in the coming months. By early next year, up to 50 firefighters may have freshly-minted red cards. But a one-off program that gives basic training to a few dozen of the state\u2019s several hundred firefighters won\u2019t be nearly enough, fire officials said. \u201cThis year\u2019s fires were an eye-opening experience, especially with how fast the (conditions) change,\u201d said St. Tammany Fire District 2 Chief Randy Hess, who has no red card-certified firefighters on his staff of 46. \u201cTo have people showing up with zero training is definitely a liability.\u201d The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry's 150 full-time wildland firefighters make up the bulk of the state\u2019s wildfire response capabilities. This year\u2019s busy wildfire season proved the department needs lots more, said Mike Strain, the state agriculture and forestry commissioner. Even if state leaders approve his recent request for 60 more firefighters, he\u2019ll still need hundreds of local fire departments to pitch in when things heat up. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need that additional training,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 400 mostly volunteer fire departments in this state, and they need all the training they can get.\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards agrees the need is there, especially as the state gets hotter and drier in the years to come. \u201cWe are going to have to invest in more time, effort and training,\u201d he said in late August while visiting the Tiger Island Fire.

Three of the state's four deadliest wildfires were sparked in October. And yet, as the month is drawing to a close, morning temperatures in Northern California flirted in the high 30s, Boreal Mountain ski resort was making snow and wildfire activity remained far below historical averages. According to Cal Fire & U.S. Forest Wildfire Statistics, as of Oct. 23, 2023: This year: 6,164 wildland fires, 312,739 acres burned 5-Year Average: 6,884 wildland fires, 1,570,571 acres burned However, even though the current statistics are trending below average, fire experts continue to preach caution that fire season isn't over. \"Even though the peak of fire season may be behind us, we now live in a fire year statewide,\" State Fire Marshal Daniel Berlant said. \"Even though we've seen rain and some snow, some of the most destructive wildfires have come after the first rain of the season.\" Cal Fire is stressing that residents should continue to take preventative measures to create defensible space near their homes.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Maui police release body camera footage from deadly Lahaina wildfire\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Maui police held a news conference on Monday to show 16 minutes of body camera footage taken the day a wildfire tore through Lahaina town in August, including video of officers rescuing 15 people from a coffee shop and taking a severely burned man to a hospital. Chief John Pelletier said his department faced a deadline to release 20 hours of body camera footage in response to an open records request and wanted to provide some context for what people would see before the video came out. Earlier this month, Maui County provided the AP with 911 call recordings in response to an open records request. The 16 minutes of video released at the news conference in Wailuku showed officers evacuating a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf shop at a supermarket on Front Street, a neighborhood that largely burned in the blaze. Officers ushered out 15 people from the coffee shop as smoke swirled in the sky around them, loaded the group into police SUVs and took them to the Lahaina Civic Center. In another clip, an officer finds a badly burned man at a shopping center and put him in the back seat of his patrol car. \u201cI\u2019ll just take you straight to the hospital. That sound good?\u201d the officer can be heard asking the man, who responds: \u201cYeah.\u201d One video shows an officer tying a tow strap to a metal gate blocking a dirt road escape route while residents use a saw to cut the gate open so a line of cars can get past. Multiple shots show officers going door-to-door telling residents to evacuate. No structures under threat as fire burns in remote Mililani area The fast-moving wildfire on Aug. 8 killed at least 99 people and burned more than 2,000 structures. Those who made it out recounted running into barricades and roads that were blocked due to the flames and downed utility poles. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. It may have been sparked by downed power lines that ignited dry, invasive grasses. An AP investigation found the answer may lie in an overgrown gully beneath Hawaiian Electric Co. power lines and something that harbored smoldering embers from an initial fire that burned in the morning and then rekindled in high winds that afternoon. Powerful winds related to a hurricane passing south of Hawaii spread embers from house to house and prevented firefighters from sending up helicopters to fight the blaze from the air.

Chicago's Office of Emergency Management and Communications issued an alert Thursday saying the city will be working throughout the weekend to \"manage traffic and public safety,\" but warned that \"car caravans that create a threat to public safety will not be tolerated.\" \"We also remind everyone that drag racing and drifting are not only illegal, but dangerous,\" the agency said. \"Anyone in violation of the ordinance will be held accountable.\" The department urged those celebrating the annual commemoration of culture \"to do safely and responsibly.\" \"We remind those participating in events to be respectful of their neighbors and communities, as well as workers at critical facilities such as hospitals. They should also be mindful of first responders and emergency vehicles that are required to pass through areas where celebrations are occurring citywide,\" the OEMC statement read. Here's what to know: Public Safety In recent years, Mexican Independence Day celebrations have led to a number of street closures in the city as revelers gathered. While OEMC noted that the city and police department have been preparing for the festivities, Chicago Ald. Brendan Reilly issued an alert to downtown residents warning \"there may be a large number of cars in caravans related to the celebration.\" \"As residents may know, in past years, the caravan has traveled downtown causing traffic congestion and noise disturbances,\" Reilly said. While Reilly and the city both noted that there are no street closures planned as of Thursday, outside of those slated for parade routes, some could be implemented should caravans arrive in the city. According to Reilly, if street closures are implemented, the following access points to downtown will remain open to residents and employees: North Halsted and West Division North Halsted and West Chicago North Halsted and West Washington North Halsted and West Madison South Halsted and South Jackson West Roosevelt and South Union 18th Street and South State 18th Street and South Michigan 18th Street and South Indiana West Division and North LaSalle \"CPD will not require residents to produce a driver's license or access pass at the above checkpoints,\" he said. It's important to note that, in addition to the Mexican Independence Day festivities, several other major events will also be taking place this weekend, adding to the potential for traffic. Riot Fest, Karol G's Soldier Field concert, a White Sox game and a United Center performance by 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes and Jeremiah add to the busy weekend in the city. Mexican Independence Day Parade Telemundo Chicago will offer a broadcast of the highly anticipated event, which is scheduled to begin at noon on Sept. 16. This year's parade will be special in that it takes place on the actual date of Mexican Independence Day and on a Saturday for the\n----------------\nArticle No.: 2\ntitle: Rethinking Chicago\u2019s Mexican Independence Day Celebrations\ndate: 2023-09-30\nbody: About 20% of Chicagoans claim Mexican heritage, according to U.S. census data. That\u2019s a distinction that makes itself especially evident every September when Mexicans at home and abroad celebrate Mexican Independence Day. Parades and festivals celebrating the holiday have long been a part of Chicago\u2019s heritage, too. Teresa Fraga of the Mexican Cultural Committee of Chicago remembers participating in the Mexican Independence Day Parade on State Street in 1974. \u201cIllinois used to organize the most beautiful parade downtown on State Street,\u201d Fraga said. \u201cIt would then turn down to 18th Street \u2026 at that time, the emerging Mexican community. (The) floats were very representative of the history and the representation of the real reason that we celebrate Mexican independence.\u201d Today, two parades still commemorate Mexican Independence Day \u2014 one in South Chicago and one on 26th Street in Little Village, organized by the Little Village Chamber of Commerce. Chamber president Jennifer Aguilar said the event, which just celebrated its 54th year, takes year-round planning and coordinating with city and community officials. \u201cOur team is a very small team of three people, but they are very experienced in doing the parade and putting everything together and working with the city to make sure that we\u2019re meeting all the required guidelines,\u201d Aguilar said. But in recent years, celebrations have gone beyond organized events. Caravans full of revelers have filled the city\u2019s downtown streets \u2014 events the city has struggled to control. Jose Mu\u00f1oz, co-chair of the Illinois Latino Agenda, penned an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune about his experience getting caught in Chicago police checkpoints on the weekend of Mexican Independence Day celebrations. \u201cThe city set up checkpoints around the city of Chicago to divide different parts of the city and keep individuals who are showing up for festivities from going into the downtown area,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cI fundamentally believe that no one, no person of color, no Mexicano should have to go \u2026 through a checkpoint, to have to show ID or to be searched, regardless of what\u2019s going on in the city.\u201d Moreover, Mu\u00f1oz said, the caravans are evidence that Chicago is not reflecting the desires of its current demographics in its municipal celebrations. \u201cWe need to have some events that are organized and put together throughout the entire city of Chicago to really welcome and embrace folks who are Mexican in the city of Chicago,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cBut car caravans and celebrations like the ones we\u2019ve been seeing in the last two years are not new to Chicago. What is new is that the population of Mexicanos, particularly young Mexicanos, is at an all-time high. We\u2019re all over the city. So the days of trying to contain us into just a couple of neighborhoods are over. The city needs to start treating Mexican Independence Day with the same respect and enthusiasm that it does with other major events like Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, Pride Month, Lollap\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: This Day in History: Jamaica\u2019s National Day of Prayer and New Flag Unveiled on August 6, 1962\ndate: 2023-08-10\nbody: It was 1962. Minutes before midnight at the Jamaican National Stadium, 20,000 Jamaicans and luminaries from around the world gathered around the flagpole watching the British Union Jack bellow in the wind. In attendance were Princess Margaret, representing her sister Queen Elizabeth II, US Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jamaican National heroes Alexander Bustamante and Norman Washington \u2014 cousins, political rivals, and that day importantly, co-architects of Jamaica\u2019s independence. The mood was revelrous. Champagne flowed and handshakes were exchanged. Promises of support and solidarity were exchanged between leaders. Princess Margaret assured soon to be first prime minister Bustamante that there were no hard feelings. Bustamante was the life of the party. The Jamaica Labour Party leader played the banjo to an enthusiastic crowd and danced the twist. Why Black, Green, and Gold A Jamaica Defense Force (JDF) officer held the new flag in his hand, ready for the exchange. Its striking black, green, and gold was as unique then as it is now. The Jamaican national flag is only one of two (the other is African country Mauritania) in the entire world that do not feature the colours, white, blue, or red. The flag was a collaborative design by a bipartisan committee to capture the essence of the people and the beauty of the country \u2014 \u2018The sun shineth; the land is green; and the people are strong and creative.\u2019 Green represents bountiful agriculture and the hope of the people. Black stands for the hardships faced to get to this point. Gold signifies the natural wealth and sunshine that\u2019s come to define the nation.

As the clock struck midnight the lights went off. In the pitch black darkness, the Union Jack was lowered and when the lights flooded back on, the Jamaican flag bellowed in its place. It was a good show, the perfect final note in the celebration. Behind the scenes, it was a nerve wracking experience. British Warrant Officer Tony Head, the man who lowered the Union Jack in 1962, spoke with the Jamaica Gleaner in 2012. \u201cI was perturbed to see that the Jamaican warrant officer was struggling to untie the knot in his halyard (the rope which raises the flag),\u201d Head recalled.

While there is a historical connection between the state of Arizona and Mexico reflected in the 89% of its population of Mexican origin, according to data from the UCLA Latino Policy Institute, those who grew up and were educated in Mexico maintain different memories of how and when Mexico's independence is celebrated. With celebrations taking place throughout the United States, and especially in Arizona, here's what you need to know about how the fight for independence in Mexico began, and how that celebration has transcended borders more than 200 years later. Mexican Independence Day 2023:Your ultimate guide to celebrating in the Phoenix area and around Arizona How is Independence Day celebrated in Mexico? September is known as the patriotic month in Mexico since the 16th commemorates the beginning of the fight for independence against Spanish forces, who controlled the country for more than 300 years. As the days go by, the streets fill with street vendors selling Mexican flags of different sizes, rattles, and typical clothing \u2014 folkloric skirts, peasant blouses, shawls, zarapes and huaraches. In schools, classrooms are decorated with green, white and red papel picado, and patriotic parties are organized where students gather to share Mexican dishes and watch ballet folkl\u00f3rico. What is 'El Grito de Dolores'? How the fight began This celebration is characterized by the performance of \u201cEl Grito de Dolores\u201d \u2014 \"grito\" meaning battle cry \u2014 inspired in the early morning of Sept. 16, 1810, when the Catholic priest Don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang the bells of his parish and called on the Mexican population to take up arms against the Spanish authorities in a fight that would last 11 years. Every year, a performance of the battle cry is carried out in the National Palace located in Mexico's capital. Inside the building in the Ambassadors Hall, a military escort made up of students from the Heroic Military College delivers the flag to the current president of Mexico while the national anthem plays. Later, the president approaches the balcony and addresses the attendees in the Z\u00f3calo esplanade to ring out the same cry, which includes the names of the heroes of independence, such as Miguel Hidalgo, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n, Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez and Ignacio Allende. Cities and organizations around the country plan events focused on this celebration for people to come together and learn about Mexican culture. How is Mexican Independence Day celebrated in the US? For the second consecutive year, the Mexican Consulate in Phoenix will hold the \"El Grito\" ceremony at the Arizona Capitol. The General Consulate of Mexico, located in major cities such as Las Vegas, New York and Miami, also organizes community events that feature a performance of the battle cry.

Hanks is arguably the most outstanding actor in the world, along with Spielberg being argued as the greatest director, so it would only make sense for them to have met in their respective careers. They first collaborated on Saving Private Ryan (1998), which resulted in a Best Director Academy Award for Spielberg, a controversial loss for Best Film, and a Best Actor nomination for Tom Hanks. The pair would reunite for Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017). The pair work well together and have produced some of history\u2019s most thought-provoking films and shows. Saving Private Ryan is arguably one of the greatest films depicting WWII, and it led to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg moving to release more stories on this hugely important moment in American history. Their collaboration would lead to Band of Brothers, a series based on the book by Steven A. Ambrose. The series would be the first time Hanks became a producer, director, and screenwriter, forever altering his career. Band of Brothers recounts the lives of \u201cEasy\u201d Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, as they parachuted into Europe during WWII and engaged in some of the most important battles in history. The series would win seven Primetime Emmy Awards, including an Outstanding Miniseries and Best Directing. Hanks and Spielberg would once again reunite to cover WWII in The Pacific, which covered the 1st Marine Division\u2019s battles in the Pacific, such as Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, and Okinawa, as well as Basilone\u2019s involvement in the Battle of Iwo Jima. The complementary series also won an Outstanding Miniseries Emmy. With so many WWII stories to be told, it was only a matter of time until Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg reunited, which they will do for Masters of the Air.

While Hanks has been associated with a slew of iconic movies, it sounds like he doesn't have the most positive outlook on every facet of his filmography . In a recent interview with The New Yorker , Hanks flat out admitted that he \"hates\" some of his movies , and then went in depth about the various phases of reckoning with a particular project. \"Oh, yeah!\" Hanks argued, before adding, \"O.K., let's admit this: We all have seen movies that we hate. I have been in some movies that I hate. You have seen some of my movies and you hate them. Here are the five points of the Rubicon that are crossed by anybody who makes movies. The first Rubicon you cross is saying yes to the film. Your fate is sealed. You are going to be in that movie. The second Rubicon is when you actually see the movie that you made. It either works and is the movie you wanted to make, or it does not work and it's not the movie you wanted to make. That has nothing to do with Rubicon No. 3, the critical reaction to it-which is a version of the vox populi. Someone is going to say, \"I hated it.\" Other people can say, \"I think it's brilliant.\" Somewhere in between the two is what the movie actually is. The fourth Rubicon is the commercial performance of the film. Because, if it does not make money, your career will be toast sooner than you want it to be. That's just the fact. That's the business.\" \"The fifth Rubicon is time,\" Hanks continued. \"Where that movie lands twenty years after the fact. What happens when people look at it, perhaps by accident. And a great example of this is \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" which was made [in 1946] and disappeared for the better part of, I'm going to say, twenty years, locked up in a rights issue. It wasn't even viewed at the time as being a commercial hit. Enough people liked it, so it was nominated for Best Picture. [The film only became a universally admired Christmas classic after the copyright ran out in 1974 and it entered the public domain, becoming a television constant.] For me, it happened on a movie that I wrote and directed called \"That Thing You Do!\" I loved making that movie.

That's what we hear all the time, anyway \u2013 but it isn't until a celebrity like Patrick Stewart writes a book and outs actor Tom Hanks as a massive fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation that we fully recognize the depths of that reality. Yes, one of America's greatest actors is a fan of TNG and a pretty big one based on a wild claim made by Stewart. Making It So: A Memoir is making headlines for various reveals from the actor, and this latest is a doozy. When discussing famous fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation , Patrick Stewart name-checks Oscar-winner Tom Hanks, who apparently watches a lot of TNG . So much so that he can do something pretty impressive. Stewart broke it down in this quote below: I'll save anyone currently firing up their Paramount+ subscription to count the trouble. There are 178 excellent and occasionally WTF-inducing episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation . Assuming that Tom Hanks wasn't exaggerating in saying he could name all of those episodes because of how many times he's watched them, that's wildly impressive. Tom Hanks might have theories about how Star Trek shows destroyed the world's enjoyment of Navy movies , but that doesn't mean he isn't a huge fan. In fact, Hanks admitted earlier this year when he appeared on Josh Horowitz's Happy Sad Confused podcast he would've been in Star Trek: First Contact , but there was never an offer made to him. After hearing about his fandom of The Next Generation , I'm more inclined to believe that, and a little sad that it never happened. Can we somehow use time travel to rewrite history and ensure it happens? Patrick Stewart also mentioned another famous Star Trek fan in his book, though he didn't have all the details personally. According to the actor, he heard that singer Frank Sinatra was also a fan of The Next Generation , but he confessed to no knowing much more than that: Somewhere in the multiverse, there's a reality in which Tom Hanks and Frank Sinatra met and bonded on their Star Trek fandoms and met with Patrick Stewart to recreate the iconic poker scenes of The Next Generation . That's what I'm choosing to believe, anyway, and I can't express enough how cool it is to hear about celebrities being fans of other pop culture stuff that they have\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Tom Hanks and Robin Wright to Be Digitally De-Aged in Upcoming Film from Forrest Gump Director\ndate: 2023-01-31\nbody: The Oscar-winning trio will reunite in upcoming film Here, which will use Metaphysic AI technology to de-age the actors Tom Hanks and Robin Wright are going back in time for their latest project together.

A photo of the actor waving to fans while being escorted around the facility was posted to the Houston subreddit yesterday. Hanks was apparently in town to film scenes for The Moonwalkers , an immersive audio and visual installation that will debut at Lightroom, a newly opened art center in London, in December. Lightroom describes the show as \"an epic experience that offers a unique new perspective on humankind\u2019s past and future voyages to the moon.\" Per the art center's description, the installation also looks at the return of manned missions to the moon for the first time in half a century thanks to behind-the-scenes interviews with Hanks and astronauts on upcoming Artemis missions. As part of Artemis, NASA will land the first woman and first person of color on the moon . Hanks helped co-write the script for The Moonwalkers . Tom Hanks seen at the Johnson Space center today by u/Zezimalives in houston One commenter on the Reddit thread said they had a chance to meet Hanks and talk to him while the actor was at the Mission Control Center . \"Super nice and clearly a space fan\u2014way better questions than the typical VIP that comes through,\" the person wrote. They also noted that Hanks toured the Space Vehicle Mockups Facility , which is used for astronaut training, and the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, another training facility that includes one of the largest indoor pools in the world. This is not Hanks' first foray into space, nor his first visit to Houston. Much of Hank's 1995 film Apollo 13 , about the ill-fated 1970 moon mission, was filmed at JSC and in the Houston area, including several scenes that were taped inside of the infamous \" Vomit Comet ,\" a special plane that makes parabolic anti-gravity flights out of Ellington Field. Hanks also narrated the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon . In fact, Hanks loves space so much, he recently said he would scrub toilets for a chance to get a seat on a lunar mission. The Moonwalkers runs Dec. 6 through April 21 at Lightroom in London.

I thought I could change his mind.\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: It was a gamble, a simple phone call to a stranger \u2014 one who happened to be headed to federal prison. Mark Anthony Rissi lives in Iowa , I in Michigan. In a nearly hour-long conversation, I discovered we\u2019re both Vietnam-era veterans, both widowed in recent years. He\u2019s 65, retired, disabled from injuries suffered over three decades in the construction business. I\u2019m a former police officer and retired television reporter, now 75 years young. I\u2019d read that he was sentenced to two and a half years for his involvement in the ongoing election-denial frenzy that followed the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots. He wasn\u2019t a participant in the Capitol assault, but feels the rioters were unjustly charged with crimes. Rissi\u2019s conviction stemmed from threatening phone calls he made to government officials in another state. And like others similarly accused, he\u2019d been exposed to his share of unflattering publicity. So I was stunned when he answered the phone and agreed to chat. I chose to call Mark because I wanted unfettered opinions from a person who knew nothing about my 33-year history as a journalist in metro Detroit. I wanted to hear what drove a man to threaten another person over politics. I hoped for a breakthrough in our exchange of information and beliefs, that just maybe I\u2019d hear a softening of the mean spirit that drove the action that will land him behind bars for the first time in his life. Mark Anthony Rissi isn't so different from half of America Rissi isn\u2019t so different, in some ways, from half the U.S. population. He\u2019s a longtime Republican whose disdain for what he calls the sorry state of America, and the Democrats he blames for it, is deeply ingrained. Yet he targeted Clint Hickman, the Republican chairman of the Maricopa County Supervisors in Arizona, and later, the state\u2019s attorney general. After Hickman announced in September 2021 that the results of an audit of the 2020 election showed the process was fair, that there was no fraud, despite Donald Trump-led claims to the contrary, Rissi called Hickman to demand he stop lying and do his job. More from Opinion: Rick Snyder took power from Michigan cities. This Legislature must restore it. Rissi was recorded via voicemail , according to prosecutors, saying, \u201cWhen we come to lynch your stupid, lying Commie [expletive], you'll remember that you lied on the [expletive] Bible, you piece of [expletive]!

He stole the show.\ndate: 2023-10-28\nbody: LAS VEGAS \u2014 A gathering of Republican presidential aspirants Saturday had all the ingredients for a Donald Trump pile-on. Instead, it turned into a demonstration of the former president\u2019s dominance in the race \u2014 and how swiftly his perceived missteps can be forgotten. Of all the Republican presidential contenders who spoke at the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s annual conference Saturday, Trump received the most sustained applause, with some in the crowd of over 1,000 people holding their iPhones aloft to get a picture of the former president. He made no reference to comments he\u2019d offered just two weeks ago criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and describing Hezbollah as \u201cvery smart\u201d in the aftermath of the attacks in Israel that had killed 1,400. Nor did the crowd seem to fixate on them. \u201cPeople judge him for what he does,\u201d said Matt Brooks, the RJC\u2019s chief executive officer, referencing elements of Trump's record like moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, \u201cas opposed to the noise.\u201d Moments earlier, a more vivid illustration of the hold Trump has on the party came when his one-time vice president, Mike Pence, announced he was suspending his campaign . The former vice president had almost no money left and little chance of making the debate stage in less than two weeks. But his departure from the race, for many in the party, represented something larger than tactical hurdles: Proof that there was no reward for those who stood up to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump, in his speech, didn\u2019t even bother mentioning his vice president. Instead, he acknowledged several of his supporters in attendance, including \u201cPawn Stars\u201d host Rick Harrison. The former president is expected to have dinner Saturday night with Republican mega-donor Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson. The planned dinner was first reported by The Messenger . \u201cHe\u2019s got an incredible reservoir of goodwill in the Jewish community,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cHe\u2019s the frontrunner in a multicandidate field, and there are people supporting the other candidates as well. \u2026 But there\u2019s no question, you saw by the response today, the strength of his support.\u201d Few, if any, politicians can swim through crises like Trump, who has survived more than a handful of episodes that pundits predicted would cause his political demise. But his primary campaign this go around has been defined less by political missteps (his legal troubles notwithstanding) than how he\u2019s avoided them.

In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump suggested Barr was trying to \u201cget even\u201d with him for being tough on him while in office. \u201cI called Bill Barr Dumb, Weak, Slow Moving, Lethargic, Gutless, and Lazy, a RINO WHO COULDN\u2019T DO THE JOB,\u201d he wrote, using the term meaning \u201cRepublican in Name Only.\u201d \u201cHe just didn\u2019t want to be Impeached, which the Radical Left Lunatics were preparing to do.\u201d \u201cI was tough on him in the White House, for good reason, so now this Moron says about me, to get even, \u2018his verbal skills are limited,\u2019\u201d the former president continued. \u201cWell, that\u2019s one I haven\u2019t heard before. Tell that to the biggest political crowds in the history of politics, by far. Bill Barr is a LOSER!\u201d Barr, who resigned in late 2020 after Trump refused to concede the election, had knocked the former president\u2019s \u201cverbal skills\u201d at an event at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. \u201cIf you get him away from \u2018very, very, very,\u2019 you know, the adjectives \u2026 they\u2019re unfamiliar to him, and they spill out, and he goes too far,\u201d he said. The former head of the Justice Department has become one of Trump\u2019s most prominent critics within the GOP, regularly refuting his claims of voter fraud and \u201cpersecution\u201d at the hands of law enforcement. \u2013Updated at 2:12 p.m. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Why guilty pleas in Georgia 2020 election case pose significant risk to Trump\ndate: 2023-10-30\nbody: The first defectors from Donald Trump's Georgia criminal case pose significant risk to the former president because they include \"senior participants\" in the alleged scheme to overthrow the 2020 election, experts say. Former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis was the latest to agree to testify in any trials related to the case, which revolves around efforts to thwart Georgia's 2020 election after Trump lost. Trump and 18 others were charged Aug. 15 by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis , and accused of operating a \"criminal enterprise\" that conspired to overturn the election. Now, four members of that alleged racket have agreed to cooperate against the other 15. Two other lawyers involved with the effort, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro , and a bail bondsman named Scott Hall , also entered guilty pleas in recent weeks. Attorney Norm Eisen described the lawyers as \"senior participants\" in two different facets of the alleged crimes: the effort to portray Trump as the winner, and the effort to have former Vice President Mike Pence use false electors to certify Trump as the winner. \"With the pleas of the three lawyers, the rug is pulled out from under both of those legs,\" said Eisen, a co-founder of States United Democracy Center, a nonpartisan advocacy organization focused on elections. \"That's because Powell and Ellis were two of the primary pushers of the false facts, and Chesebro of the false legal theory.\" Ellis said at her sentencing Tuesday that \"I failed to do my due diligence\" in agreeing to work on Trump's behalf in 2020. \"If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these post-election challenges. I look back on this whole experience with deep remorse,\" Ellis said. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis said Ellis' and other confessions are \"a huge boon for the D.A. when this goes to trial as prosecutors work to secure convictions.\" \"It also makes the case harder to attack politically as individuals are now on the record about their culpability in the scheme to overturn the election,\" Kreis said. Dominoes falling toward Trump Ellis, Powell, Chesebro and Hall all struck deals that included probation, but no jail time. Eisen said Willis' history in major racketeering cases shows she pushes guilty plea dominoes toward high-profile or senior defendants. As those pieces begin falling, other defendants often feel pressure to pursue deals of their own, he said. \"I would expect more dominoes at any time,\" said Eisen, who served as special counsel\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Inflating Home Price: Letitia James Under Fire\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: Title: Letitia James Accused of Inflating Home Prce of her own New York State Attorney General Letitia James has come under scrutiny for allegedly inflating the value of a home she recently sold. The accusation has raised concerns about transparency and ethical behavior, particularly as James has positioned herself as a champion of fairness and accountability. The controversy stems from claims made by a whistleblower who worked closely with James during her tenure as Attorney General. The whistleblower alleges that James intentionally manipulated the appraisal process to overvalue the property, resulting in a higher sale price. This, in turn, has sparked accusations of financial impropriety and misuse of power. James has vehemently denied the allegations, stating that they are politically motivated and aimed at tarnishing her reputation. She contends that the sale was conducted in accordance with legal guidelines and that any discrepancies in the valuation were unintentional. Nevertheless, calls for an independent investigation into the matter have intensified, with critics arguing that public officials must be held to the highest standard of integrity. The outcome of this investigation will play a crucial role in determining James' future and the public's perception of her ability to fulfill her duty as the state's top legal officer. In a time when public trust in elected officials is already fragile, it is essential that allegations like this be thoroughly examined to maintain the integrity and accountability of those entrusted with positions of power.d d Conveniently, Letitia James should consider investigating herself. In 2017 she secured a mortgage on a property she owned for $625,000. That year the assessed value on that home was only $94,000 and the market value was only $546,000.

On Friday, Swift released a new re-recording of her nine-year-old album \"1989\" on the heels of the first leg of Swift's record-breaking \"Eras\" tour and the release of the movie version of the concert , catapulting her wealth past the billion-dollar mark, Bloomberg reported. She now has a net worth of $1.1 billion, Bloomberg reported, based on an analysis of publicly disclosed figures, including the value of Swift's real estate, her music catalog, streaming deals, music and concert ticket sales as well as merchandise. How Taylor Swift became a billionaire Her music catalog, which includes songs released by Swift since 2019, is worth an estimated $400 million, according to Bloomberg. She's earned another $370 million from concert ticket and merchandise sales. Spotify and YouTube partnerships have netted her $120 million. Her real estate portfolio, which comprises five homes, is worth an estimated $110 million, according to Bloomberg. She's made another $80 million in royalties from record sales, the publication estimates. Swift shows no signs of stopping, either. The \"Eras\" tour will resume abroad next month, with 89 performances lined up.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Taylor Swift's Re-Recordings Are Inspiring Contract Changes by Major Record Labels Hoping to Avoid Similar Situations\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: Record labels are introducing new changes to their contracts inspired by Taylor Swift. Swift began to re-record her first six studio albums in 2019 in order to regain ownership of her masters after she was unable to buy the rights to her music when her former label, Big Machine Records, was infamously acquired by Scooter Braun. The effort has been successful, with each re-recorded album outperforming their original counterparts, including her most recent release 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). In light of Swift\u2019s success, labels are ready to enact new clauses to prevent future artists from devaluing the original works. Major record companies, such as Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group, are set to introduce stricter contract terms for artists by demanding longer waiting periods before they can re-record their music, according to Billboard. These waiting periods, typically five to seven years from the release date of the original, or two years after the contract expires, have now been extended to 10, 15, or 30 years. However, some artists and their attorneys are pushing back against these new restrictions. \u201cThe first time I saw it, I tried to get rid of it entirely,\" said attorney Josh Karp, who has viewed the new clauses in Universal Music Group\u2019s contracts. \"I was just like, \u2018What is this? This is strange. Why would we agree to further restrictions than we\u2019ve agreed to in the past with the same label?\u201d Re-recording music to gain control of one's masters isn\u2019t a new practice. In 2013, TLC re-recorded several of their biggest hits, including \u201cWaterfalls\u201d and \u201cNo Scrubs,\u201d to be used for their CrazySexyCool biopic and on the deluxe edition of their final self-titled album. After a lengthy legal battle with her former record label, singer JoJo released re-recorded versions of her 2004 self-titled debut album and 2006\u2019s The High Road in 2019. In 2021, Ashanti announced plans to hit the studio for a new version of her debut album, to the ire of her former Murder Inc. label boss Irv Gotti. According to attorney Josh Binder, who represents artists like SZA, Gunna, and Doechii, the scenario of artists exercising their re-recording rights is rare. \u201cRarely does it come into play where the re-record treatment is even used,\u201d he told Billboard. \u201c[The labels\u2019] position is, \u2018Hey, if we\u2019re going to spend a bunch of money creating this brand with you, then you should not try and create records to compete with us.\u2019 We try and fight it. We try and make it as short as possible. But I don\u2019t find it to be the most compelling issue to fight.\u201d\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Spotify Record for Most Single-Day Streams for an Artist With \u20181989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019 Release\ndate: 2023-10-28\nbody: On the day of the release of \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d Taylor Swift set a Spotify record in becoming the artist with the most streams in a single day in the streaming service\u2019s history, according to a statement from Spotify on Saturday on X.

Spotify did not release overall numbers for the album or Swift\u2019s total as an artist, as is its custom when announcing records being broken. But the company did say that the new Vault track \u201c\u2018Slut!\u2019 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d debuted in the U.S. at No. 1 with 5.2 million streams, and globally with 11.3 million.

The single-day record for a single artist that she broke was her own, Spotify said.

With a rich history dating back to 1850, the company has continuously evolved to meet the changing needs of its customers and stay ahead of the competition. In its early years, American Express started as an express mail business, delivering packages and valuables across the United States. However, it quickly recognized the opportunity to expand its services and ventured into the financial sector. In 1882, the company introduced its first money order, providing a secure and convenient way for customers to send and receive payments. As the financial landscape continued to evolve, American Express adapted and introduced new products and services. In 1958, the company launched its first charge card, revolutionizing the way people made purchases. This innovative concept allowed customers to make purchases without the need for cash, providing them with a sense of security and convenience. This marked the beginning of American Express\u2019s journey as a pioneer in the credit card industry. Throughout the years, American Express has continued to push the boundaries of innovation. In 1975, the company introduced the first gold card, offering enhanced benefits and privileges to its cardholders. This was followed by the introduction of the platinum card in 1984, catering to a more affluent customer base. These premium cards not only provided exclusive perks but also became a status symbol for those who held them. In the 1990s, American Express embraced technology and launched its online banking platform, allowing customers to manage their accounts and make transactions from the comfort of their homes. This move was a game-changer in the industry, as it paved the way for the digital transformation of financial services. In recent years, American Express has continued to innovate and adapt to the changing needs of its customers. The company has embraced mobile technology, allowing customers to make payments using their smartphones and wearables. It has also introduced features like instant rewards redemption and personalized offers, enhancing the overall customer experience. Furthermore, American Express has been at the forefront of the push for contactless payments. With the rise of mobile wallets and contactless cards, the company has made it easier than ever for customers to make secure and convenient transactions. This has become especially important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as contactless payments have gained popularity due to their hygienic nature.

This article will delve into JPM Coin, exploring its purpose, usage, and future projections. Also, why JP Morgan aspires for it to become the most widely used CBDC in the United States. Now, let\u2019s make a brief review of the JPM Coin. What is JPM Coin? JP Morgan\u2019s Coin is a digital currency developed by JPMorgan Chase. It is specifically designed for use in the realm of wholesale payments, targeting institutional clients. JPM Coin operates on a permissioned, private blockchain network. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are public and open to anyone. JP Morgan\u2019s Coin was created to streamline and expedite the settlement of transactions within JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients. It aims to provide an efficient and secure digital alternative to traditional settlement systems and processes. JPM Coin Use Cases I think this token has three main goals: Payment and Settlement JP Morgan\u2019s Coin is primarily employed in facilitating instantaneous and secure payment and settlement processes within the bank. When clients engage in transactions, the corresponding funds are converted into JPM Coins. These digital coins are then used to execute the transactions. This process significantly reduces the time required for settlement, which can take days in traditional banking systems. Tokenization JPM Coin is tokenized to represent the US dollar. Each JPM Coin is equivalent to one US dollar, providing stability and consistency. This one-to-one pegging ensures that clients can have confidence in the value and reliability of JPM Coin. Accessibility At its inception, JP Morgan\u2019s Coin was only available for select institutional clients and was largely restricted for use within the bank\u2019s ecosystem. However, the project\u2019s trajectory has shown a growing interest in expanding its utility, including the possibility of wider accessibility in the future. Projections for JPM Coin Integration and Expansion The future of JP Morgan\u2019s Coin appears promising. It\u2019s reasonable to anticipate further integration of JPM Coin into the bank\u2019s operations Extending its use across various business units and partners. The bank is exploring options to broaden its usage. Which could include making it accessible to a wider range of customers and potentially involving cross-border transactions. CBDC Development One noteworthy projection is JPM Coin\u2019s\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: JPMorgan\u2019s stablecoin to go retail as volumes surpass $1B\ndate: 2023-10-26\nbody: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s proprietary digital token, JPM Coin, is reportedly handling transactions worth $1 billion each day, signaling the growing acceptance and usage of the bank\u2019s stablecoin. The news was confirmed by Takis Georgakopoulos, JPMorgan\u2019s Global Head of Payments, during an interview on Bloomberg Television. Launched in 2020, the JPM Coin was initially designed as a temporary means for real-time gross settlement among JPMorgan\u2019s institutional clientele. The digital token is a stablecoin pegged directly to the US dollar, with a 1:1 collateralization ratio. Its primary purpose was to address fundamental inefficiencies that plague the existing payment infrastructure. Georgakopoulos highlighted three key issues in the current payment systems: the speed of payments, particularly in cross-border transactions; the separation of money and information, which complicates transaction tracking and reconciliation; and the fungibility of money. JPMorgan aims to address these issues through JPM Coin. While the majority of JPM Coin transactions currently occur in US dollars, JPMorgan has plans to extend its utility. The next step, according to Georgakopoulos, involves creating a retail version of the digital asset. This could be achieved through central bank digital currency (CBDC) or by enabling banks to develop digitalized versions of deposits using blockchain technology. Earlier in June, the Wall Street lender expanded the usage of its blockchain-based settlement token to include euro-denominated payments. The first transaction on the platform was conducted by German tech conglomerate Siemens AG. The trial took place on JP Morgan\u2019s permissioned blockchain, a distributed ledger that is not open to the public and requires authorization for access. The platform enables the lender\u2019s institutional clients to conduct wholesale payments across global accounts using blockchain technology as the underlying infrastructure. JPM Coin serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger, enabling participating entities to transfer fiat money held in deposit with the largest bank in the United States. Since its launch in 2019, the token has facilitated over $400 billion in transactions, establishing itself as one of the most prominent applications of blockchain technology by a traditional financial institution. That compares to JPMorgan\u2019s daily transaction volume of nearly $10 trillion through conventional means.

This name, coined by famed New England author Joseph A. Citro during a radio broadcast in 1992, refers to an area that extends from Bennington as its nexus, enveloping the nearby towns of Woodford, Shaftsbury, and Somerset. This geographical anomaly is noteworthy because of its tangible borders and intangible mysteries. The lore of the Bennington Triangle has been passed down the generations, and to this day, the locals recount tales of uncanny phenomena with a shiver and a twinkle in their eyes. From unexplained disappearances to otherworldly sounds and lights, sightings of UFOs, and Bigfoot-like creatures, this region never ceases to stir intrigue and fascination. A Timeline of Disappearances: The Haunting Memories A chilling string of disappearances ignited the intrigue of the Bennington Triangle. The missing people ranged in age and circumstance, yet each case was similarly mystifying. Here is a more in-depth look at these five notorious disappearances: Middie Rivers, 1945: A seasoned hunter and guide, Rivers led a group back from a hunting trip when he strayed ahead and vanished. Despite extensive searches, only a single rifle cartridge was found. Paula Welden, 1946: A bright college student, Welden decided to take a solitary hike on the Long Trail. Her disappearance sparked a massive manhunt involving local authorities, the FBI, and volunteers, but to no avail. James E. Tedford, 1949: A veteran, Tedford was returning to the Bennington Soldier\u2019s Home when he mysteriously vanished from a moving bus. His belongings were in the luggage rack, and an open bus timetable rested on his vacant seat. Paul Jepson, 1950: The young boy, left briefly unattended by his mother, disappeared from his family\u2019s truck. Search dogs tracked his scent to the same stretch of the Long Trail where Welden had vanished years prior. Frieda Langer, 1950: Langer slipped into a stream during a hike near the Somerset Reservoir. She went to the campsite to change clothes but never returned. These stories are indelibly imprinted in the collective memory of the local community, adding a unique character to the Bennington Triangle.

Eerie lights hovering in the sky, unexplainable humming sounds echoing through the mountains, and even sightings of a wild, hairy creature, eerily akin to the legendary Bigfoot, have all added to the area\u2019s intrigue. The unusual activity has sparked countless debates among local folk and attracted the interest of paranormal enthusiasts and researchers, adding another dimension to the region\u2019s unique identity. The Echoes of Native American Legends The Native American tribes of the area were the first to express wariness about the land now known as the Bennington Triangle. The Algonquian tribe called this area a \u201ccursed land\u201d inhabited by an evil spirit. Their lore spoke of four winds that converged in this area, creating a thin space where the barriers between reality and the otherworldly were most permeable. This rich cultural heritage further intensifies the enigma of the Bennington Triangle. The Serenity Amidst the Enigma Yet, amidst the tales of the peculiar and the paranormal, the Bennington Triangle reveals a remarkable and serene beauty. The sprawling vistas of the Green Mountain National Forest, hiking trails that meander through verdant wilderness, pristine water bodies, and the resplendent flora and fauna all contribute to the area\u2019s natural allure. The tranquil charm of this area serves as a stark contrast to its eerie folklore, creating a compelling mixture of the enchanting and the eerie. The Resounding Echoes of the Past Despite the time, signs of the Bennington Triangle\u2019s history are evident in abandoned logging towns like Glastonbury and the remnants of erstwhile industries. These vestiges, slowly reclaimed by nature, evoke a sense of nostalgia and an appreciation for the enduring nature of local lore. Looking Ahead: The Bennington Triangle\u2019s Future The tales and mysteries of the Bennington Triangle in southwestern Vermont are not merely relics of the past but catalysts for its future. The local community has embraced its storied history, using it as a springboard for local tourism and cultural initiatives. The lore and mysteries have become integral to the area\u2019s identity, encouraging a unique unity and a sense of pride among its residents.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 4\ntitle: Weekly Safety Report: Stolen Rifle, Car Crash, Reckless Shooting, and Vehicle Vandalism in Bennington County, Vermont\ndate: 2023-10-21\nbody: This week in Bennington County, Vermont, several incidents occurred that required police attention.

David Booker , Miles Collins and Josiah Hughley were on trial last week for the July 2022 fatal shooting of 29-year-old Bradley Coleman. The proceedings came to an abrupt end, however, when a judge declared a mistrial following improper comments made by the prosecution. Credit: Gwinnett County Police Department It was the third day of testimony when the defense asked for a mistrial \u201cbased on an improper comment made by the prosecutor, incorrectly attributing a statement to one of the defendants, implicating himself and a co-defendant,\u201d Superior Court Judge Tamela Adkins wrote in her order granting the motion. Trial underway for trio accused in 2022 killing of former Gwinnett coach The prosecution\u2019s exact comment was not stated in the order, but Adkins said in court that she thought the comment was so improper that it prejudiced the jury and there was no other remedy than to grant the request for a mistrial. \u201cI can\u2019t unring the bell,\u201d she said. Mistrial declared for trio accused of killing former Gwinnett coach in 2022 In a statement, the Gwinnett County District Attorney\u2019s Office said the decision to grant the mistrial was based on a \u201ctechnical issue within the legal proceedings\u201d and vowed to retry the case. The new trial has been set for the week of Sept. 16, 2024, according to court records. Coleman, who was living in Louisiana at the time of his death, was in town visiting his young daughter, according to his friends and family. He was putting air in his tires at a QuikTrip in Peachtree Corners when a group of men tried to steal his Dodge Charger, according to Gwinnett police. He was killed while trying to fight them off. Detective: Man linked to fatal shooting at QuikTrip through rental car, cellphone The Norcross High School graduate was a former football coach at Peachtree Ridge High School. The suspects also were being tried for gang offenses, with the state alleging that the trio was part of the Bloods gang and planned to take Coleman\u2019s vehicle by force in order to help the gang and to maintain or increase their status. After the mistrial was declared, Coleman\u2019s mother, Venetia Coleman, told Channel 2 Action News that \u201cit was an unfortunate situation that happened, but we understand that a delay is not a denial.\u201d Get all the news about the Atlanta Braves delivered each morning.

The Georgia FirstGen brochure begins like a novel. \u201cOn a cold and rainy February morning, Charbel Aoun, MS \u201921 (PharmD \u201925) and Francisco Martinez, MS \u201821 were in a college study area when they entered the competition. \u201cBeing the first in their families to graduate from high school and attend college, Aoun and Martinez understood the real, yet not impossible barriers that students face when working to achieve a college education.\u201d Though they did not win the competition, a wave of interest from the community spurred the founders on to forming a nonprofit organization to support the growth and success of first generation high school students and, just as importantly, to create a sense of belonging and community for these students. Aoun, a third year pharmacy student at PCOM Georgia, is the founding executive director. After earning a bachelor\u2019s degree from Georgia State University in physics and astronomy, Martinez, a Lanier High School graduate from Sugar Hill, completed a master\u2019s degree in physics from Georgia Tech and works as a data analyst. Georgia FirstGen has helped 750 high school students To date, Georgia FirstGen has student chapters at seven Gwinnett County high schools and has served 750 first generation students who have more than a 95% acceptance rate into college, according to Aoun. In addition, Aoun has helped organize more than 45 educational meetings and conferences. \u201cThese events have served as a platform for students from underrepresented backgrounds to gain valuable insights into higher education and career opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cWitnessing the impact of these events on students\u2019 lives has been incredibly gratifying. It reaffirms my belief that education can transform lives and break down barriers.\u201d Aoun\u2019s efforts have been noticed. Last year, Aoun was named to the 35 Under 35 class by the Gwinnett Young Professionals, which is sponsored by the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce. This year, Georgia Trend magazine recognized Aoun, 27, as a member of the 2023 class of 40 Under 40 and placed his photo on the cover of the magazine as the youngest to receive this year\u2019s recognition. Aoun said, \u201cBeing named to Georgia Trend\u2019s 40 Under 40 is a significant and humbling honor representing a pivotal moment in my career.\u201d He added, \u201cThe award reflects my dedication to equitable access to higher education and the transformative power of mentorship. \u201cIt motivates me to continue pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in pharmacy, advocating for healthcare improvement, and empowering future generations of leaders through education. \u2018It\u2019s about how we can make the table larger for everyone to be a part of it\u2019 \u201cBeing the youngest on this list gives me an opportunity to showcase why my perspective, why my voice, why my intentionality to work is absolutely needed,\u201d he said, \u201cin an age where young professionals and young healthcare advocates aren\u2019t as well represented.\u201d He noted that the philosophy he lives by \u2013 \u201cIf not you, then who?\u201d - ensures that healthcare professionals, first generation advocates, and future leaders need to be present in every part of the conversation. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about adding seats to the table. It\u2019s about how we can make the table larger for everyone to be a part of it.\u201d Aoun grew up in Gwinnett County and is a product of Gwinnett County Public Schools, graduating from Mountain View High School in Lawrenceville. The first of five children, he was born in the early \u201890s shortly after his parents met and were married following their immigration to the United States in hopes of pursuing a fresh start - his father from Lebanon and his mother from Syria. Gwinnett\u2019s small community at the time attracted them, where Aoun said, \u201cthey felt that they could raise a family and connect with a sense of diversity.\u201d In addition, Gwinnett\u2019s school system was a deciding factor in their move to Gwinnett. Aoun earned a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from Georgia State University, before matriculating into PCOM Georgia in Suwanee in 2018 where he earned a Master of Science degree in organizational development and leadership. He then enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. Dedicated to a pharmacy career Aoun\u2019s dedication to the pharmacy field extends beyond the classroom and pharmacy counter. He serves as vice chair of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Student Forum Executive Committee and is actively involved in the Georgia Pharmacy Association. In the community, he is a member of the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce and its Gwinnett Young Professionals board. His plans including merging his passion for pharmacy with his commitment to leadership and education. \u201cI aspire to continue my journey as a pharmacist, leveraging my diverse educational background and clinical experiences to provide exemplary patient care,\u201d he said. He also envisions a future beyond clinical practice. \u201cI see myself taking on roles that allow me to contribute to advancing pharmacy practice as a whole.\u201d Future endeavors could include teaching and mentoring student pharmacists as part of an academic faculty, or healthcare administration positions that enable him to influence policy, drive quality improvement initiatives and optimize patient outcomes. \u201cUltimately, my overarching goal is to leave a lasting legacy in pharmacy and health care. I am also deeply passionate about mentorship and inspiring future generations to pursue their dreams and aspirations in the healthcare sector.\u201d He said that if he had a do-over, he would not change his healthcare profession. \u201cPharmacy gives me the space to be a future educator who can guide patients and professionals while advancing the healthcare community.\u201d\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

A Tarrant County grand jury returned an indictment against Cindy Rodriguez-Singh, who is believed to have fled the country. She was also charged with two counts of injury to a child and one count of abandoning without the intent to return, Everman Police Chief Craig Spencer told reporters. \u201cThis is a rewarding part of the investigation where we feel like our work in this effort is finally paying off, that we're able to to find some justice for Noel and push towards that finish line,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it also confirms our biggest fear.\u201d Noel was labeled an \u201cendangered missing person\u201d on March 25, the same day an AMBER Alert went out for his disappearance. Police say Rodriguez-Singh and her husband fled to India with six of their children soon after law enforcement opened an investigation. Police have not ruled out charges for the husband, Arshdeep Singh, Spencer said. It\u2019s been about one year since the last time Noel was seen alive. Police say he was seen at a hospital in October as his mother gave birth to twins. At the time of his disappearance, Rodriguez-Singh alternately told witnesses Noel was with his biological father in Mexico, with his aunt in Mexico or was sold to a woman in the parking lot of a Fiesta supermarket, according to police. Investigators determined none of those stories were true. Witnesses also told police Rodriguez-Singh was known to be abusive toward Noel, and that she called her son \"evil, possessed or having a demon in him.\" She did not want Noel \u2014 who has intellectual disabilities \u2014 near her other children, according to police. \u201cEvery single one of us has had and I mean, to be honest, still has a glimmer of hope,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI would love nothing more than to be wrong on this case. I think the last thing I want is to have a 6-year-old boy die at the hands of his mother. I mean, that's not what I want, but that's the facts that we're faced here with and that's what we're looking at. And it's our job to bring that to justice.\u201d\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: CRIME LOG: MPPD investigates a missing person, larcenies, deer incident\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: The following incidents were among those handled by the Mount Pleasant Police Department in the period of Oct. 21 to Oct. 25.

The Louisiana Lottery has confirmed that a ticket sold in Louisiana was one of the game's biggest winners. The ticket matched the numbers needed to claim a prize of $150,000. Last night, October 30, 2023, the Powerball multi-state lottery game held its Monday drawing. The game's top prize for last night was an estimated $138 million dollars.

You'll also see via that site that no tickets sold across the Powerball game footprint matched the numbers needed to claim the game's top prize. So, that means when the next Powerball drawing is held on November 1st, the estimated top prize will be $152 million dollars. The Texas Lottery confirmed via its website that there were no big money prize winners in the Lone Star State as far as last night's Powerball was concerned. Texas Lottery website says the largest prize won by a Texas-sold ticket last night was $300.

Lottery officials in Louisiana say the ticket matched four of the five white balls, the Powerball, and they invoked the Power Play option on the game too.

Carlos Mathis, 36, was sentenced to serve 120 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release by U.S. District Judge Clay Land after he pleaded guilty to possession of a stolen firearm on May 23. The defendant is not eligible for parole. \u201cThe defendant \u2014 who was wanted on several outstanding warrants at the time of his arrest \u2014 acted recklessly, endangering himself and others when he fled an officer while in possession of a stolen gun,\u201d U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary said in a news release. \u201cThe community\u2019s protection is paramount; I want to thank the federal, state and local law enforcement agencies for their ongoing efforts to improve the safety of all.\u201d \u201cCriminals must understand that there are serious repercussions for the illegal possession of firearms. ATF and our law enforcement partners will contribute all necessary time and effort to ensure criminals are brought to justice,\u201d ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Beau Kolodka said. According to court documents, at approximately 1 a.m. on Oct. 2, 2022, a Georgia Department of Public Safety officer attempted to pull over a vehicle traveling 112 mph on Interstate 185 in Muscogee County. The vehicle increased its speed, made improper lane changes and abruptly exited the interstate at Manchester Expressway, narrowly missing another vehicle. The fleeing vehicle careened out of control and stuck a concrete median before spinning around and traveling the wrong way (going west in the eastbound lanes) down Manchester Expressway toward the I-185 exit ramp. To prevent a catastrophic collision, the trooper employed a pit maneuver to disable the vehicle. The vehicle came to a stop in the roadway and the driver, Mathis, fled from the vehicle into a wooded area and was quickly apprehended without further incident. A stolen and loaded Sig Sauer 9mm pistol was found on the driver\u2019s side floorboard. A backpack that contained three large bags of marijuana and a digital scale with residue on it was located behind the passenger seat. Mathis was wanted on several outstanding warrants at the time. He has multiple state felony convictions in Georgia including criminal attempt to commit a felony, giving an inmate a prohibited item without authorization, burglary and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. It is illegal for a convicted felon to possess a firearm. The case was investigated by the Georgia Department of Public Safety, the Columbus Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Assistant U.S. Attorney Crawford Seals prosecuted the case for the government.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Athens-Clarke police now offering $10,000 hiring incentive for new officers\ndate: 2023-10-11\nbody: Athens-Clarke County Police Chief Jerry Saulters this week announced a new incentive package for hiring new officers that triples what had been offered. New hires will receive a check for $10,000. The money was made available in June when the state awarded the police department more than $1.6 million for recruiting incentives. The grant money is part of $83 million announced by Gov. Brian Kemp through the Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Budget. Many police departments and sheriff\u2019s offices that are receiving the grant money are using it for such items as new technology and modern policing programs. Athens-Clarke decided to use the grant money to provide more officers working in the community, police Lt. Jody Thompson said Tuesday. \u201cWe were already offering $3,000 (hiring incentive), but this adds to it to make it a $10,000 hiring incentive,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe were allowed to expand it over to communications officers and we\u2019re very excited about that,\u201d he said. The police department currently has 51 sworn police officer openings and 30 civilian openings of which 17 are dispatcher positions. Thompson said that the incentive is also offered to officers making a lateral move from another department. \u201cSomebody in a rural area can come in making substantially more plus the $10,000. It\u2019s very enticing,\u201d he said. First year police officers in the department make $53,733, according to the department. Wildlife:Bobcat attacks on 2 children reported in Oglethorpe County Most law enforcement offices in the region are posting openings for positions. \"It's been challenging,\" Thompson said about recruiting officers. \"But we're getting plenty of applicants.\" Saulters issued a statement that \u201cthis new hiring incentive is exciting news for our department and the community. It will allow us to put more officers on the street and have more communications officers answering 911 calls.\u201d The police department also noted it has other work-related incentives including an in-county residence stipend, a take-home vehicle program and a pay plan program directed at retention.\n----------------\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

This season, it\u2019s a good thing. The team from the D is getting plenty of offensive contribution from the D. More than any other team in the NHL in fact. Accounting for another four points in Monday\u2019s 4-3 overtime verdict over the New York Islanders, Detroit\u2019s blueline brigade was raising their NHL-leading number to 33 points. Moritz Seider was dishing out a pair of assists, while his defense partner Jake Walman would score once and also contribute a helper. \u201cIt starts with D and then getting the puck up to our guys we got,\u201d Walman told Bally Sports Detroit. \u201cEverybody can bury it.\u201d Seider is leading all NHL defensemen with nine assists. He rates in a tie for second overall in points among reaguards with 10. Offseason addition Shayne Gostisbehere is in a tie for fourth spot on that list with 3-6-9 numbers. Gostisbehere (six) and Seider (five) have also collected 11 power-play points between them. Walman is next on the list with 2-3-5 totals, but all seven of Detroit\u2019s defensemen have at least two points to their names. Justin Holl has three assists in eight games and an impressive +7 rating. Ben Chiarot has a goal and an assist, while both Jeff Petry and Olli Maatta are showing two assists each next to them on the stats sheet. Red Wings End Island Drought Detroit had never won a game at UBS Arena, new home to the New York Islanders, prior to Monday\u2019s victory. The Red Wings were 0-3 there. As well, they were also halting an 0-5-2 overall skid on the road against the Islanders. Compher Reaches Milestone It was looking as if J.T. Compher was the scorer of the game winner when his third-period tally was completing Detroit\u2019s rally from a 2-0 deficit to take a 3-2 lead. The Islanders would tie the game on an esnuing power play, sending the contest to overtime. Compher would still be playing a hero\u2019s role, only this time as a set-up man. His pass would set up Lucas Raymond for the OT winner in Detroit\u2019s 4-3 victory. In doing so, Compher was collecting the 199th and 200th points of his NHL career.\n----------------\nArticle No.: 3\ntitle: Detroit Red Wings come alive in third period, win at N.Y. Islanders in OT, 4-3\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: A strong finish cast the Detroit Red Wings' first multi-game trip of the season in better standing. Their third-period outburst Monday at UBS Arena came after the New York Islanders had taken a two-goal lead. Lucas Raymond completed the rally when he scored at 1:25 of overtime, giving the Wings a 4-3 victory and ending a winless skid at three. Ville Husso came through with 25 saves through two periods, delivering a second straight topnotch performance. Daniel Sprong broke Ilya Sorokin at 7:55 of the third period, and Jake Walman followed up at 9:35. J.T. Compher added a goal at 11:43, the first time on this two-game trip, which began Saturday in Boston, that the Wings had a lead. Moritz Seider assisted on Compher's and Walman's goals. The Wings (6-3-1) salvaged two points from a trip that began with a 4-1 dud to the Bruins. What happened:Technical issues mean no Red Wings on Bally Sports app, and viewers aren't happy The Islanders looked like they were in command when Brock Nelson made it 2-0 early in the third period. The Wings had gotten dinged with 1:21 to play in the second period, giving up a shorthanded goal to Casey Cizikas. Defenseman Noah Dobson, a first-round pick from 2018 (No. 12) who has posted back to back performances in the high-30s points range, assisted on Nelson's and Horvat's goals. The Islanders were able to tie it at 3-all at 15:49, when Bo Horvat converted while David Perron was in the penalty box.

They turned the ball over three times, including a pick-six that drew the game to within two points in the second half. They settled for field goals on their first three scoring drives. But thanks to a very strong defensive effort\u2014including a six-sack performance against Jimmy Garoppolo\u2014the game never truly seemed very close. With a big breakout game from rookie running back Jahmyr Gibbs and another 100-yard performance via Amon-Ra St. Brown, the Lions cruised to a 26-14 victory and a 6-2 record as they head into the bye week. Here\u2019s how it happened. First quarter The Raiders won the toss and deferred, giving the Lions the first opportunity to get on the board. Detroit got an early third-down conversion with an easy 5-yard pass to tight end Sam LaPorta. Jahmyr Gibbs picked up a pair of first downs with a couple of catches, as well, as the Lions moved into Raiders territory. But after a couple of ineffective runs, the Lions were forced into a third-and-8, and Jared Goff couldn\u2019t find LaPorta. That left a 44-yard field goal attempt for Riley Patterson, and the kick was good. 3-0 Lions. The Raiders were able to pick up a single first down, but on a third-and-10, Jimmy Garoppolo\u2019s scramble came up a yard short after Alex Anzalone chased him to the boundary, and Las Vegas was forced to punt. Detroit\u2019s next offensive drive wouldn\u2019t last long. Josh Reynolds made one hell of a catch, wrestling it away from a defender, but he would go on to fumble it and the Raiders recovered at Detroit\u2019s 26-yard line. But Kerby Joseph got the ball right back for Detroit, picking off a pass intended for Davante Adams. The Lions quickly went three-and-out following two straight incompletions from Goff, and the Raiders took over at their own 41-yard line. Las Vegas quickly squandered the opportunity, going four-and-out\u2014failing to convert on a fourth-and-2 with an incomplete pass to Hunter Renfrow. The Lions were quickly in business after an 8-yard run by Gibbs and a huge third-and-11 conversion from Kalif Raymond. That set the Lions up first-and-goal from the 8-yard line as we moved into the second quarter. Second quarter The Lions red zone offense looked like a disaster. A holding penalty pushed them back 10 yards and a cutesy run play moved them even further back. A screen to Kalif Raymond moved them back to the Raiders\u2019 8-yard line\u2014after trying to draw the Raiders offsides, they settled for a 31-yard field goal. 6-0 Lions. After another three-and-out for the Raiders, the Lions picked up the first explosive play of the game: a 44-yard pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown. Two plays later, Goff found St. Brown for another 24 yards. But the Lions stalled in the red zone again, after a lateral to St. Brown lost 8 yards on a second-and-1. Detroit opted for another short field goal, and Patterson was good from 33 yards. 9-0 Lions. The Raiders finally got on the board with a long drive. Josh Jacobs had some running room, and they were aided by a 15-yard penalty on Jerry Jacob\n----------------\nArticle No.: 5\ntitle: Technical issues mean no Detroit Red Wings on Bally Sports app, and viewers aren't happy\ndate: 2023-10-31\nbody: When the Detroit Red Wings ' game on Monday night began, it was unavailable on the Bally Sports Detroit app. A message posted on BSD's social media account on X, formerly Twitter, explained why viewers could not see the evening's game at the New York Islanders via the app. \"Our service provider experienced a widespread outage that impacted multiple partners.

Prosecutors claim Demons left a Fort Lauderdale-area music studio with Williams (AKA YNW Sakchaser) and Thomas (AKA YNW Juvy) in the early morning hours in a Jeep SUV and shot the two victims inside the vehicle on the side of a desolate Miramar road.\nAnother member of YNW Melly's rap crew, Cortlen Henry, drove up to Miramar Memorial Hospital in the Jeep with the bodies of Williams and Thomas, claiming they had been victims of a drive-by.\nSurveillance footage shows Demons leaving the studio in the Jeep with the two victims earlier that morning.\nBut the defense's lone witness Adrian Davis, who had left the studio as a passenger in a red Mitsubishi, claims Demons later hopped into the car with him and that they wound up back at Demons' house. On July 18, Davis testified that he and Demons found out about the killings together at the home that morning.\n\"We all were crying,\" Davis said on the stand.\nDuring cross-examination, prosecutor Kristine Bradley pressed Davis about Demons' whereabouts around the time of the shooting. Davis said he could not remember parts of the night and was sleeping on the car ride in the Mitsubishi \u2014 but he stood by the narrative that Demons was at home with him when they learned of the murders.\nDavis said lead detective Mark Moretti never interviewed him throughout his investigation.\nProsecutors claim cellphone records, the angles at which the bullets struck the victims, and testimony from medical examiners show that the narrative about the drive-by shooting was fabricated.\nFor several hours, Bradley had Moretti read through text messages between Demons and Williams, which allegedly show a dispute was brewing between the two men over money and how Demons' mother was treating Williams.\nJurors saw an exchange in late August 2018 in which the prosecution claims Williams sent Demons a message saying, \"Ain't gone lie, I'm tired of y'all getting y'all credit on shit.\"\nDemons allegedly responded by declaring in part, \"Ima pay u back for everything [you] did for me... Every idea all dat. We always gone be brothers.\"\n\"But I'll never hurt u bra,\" Demons said, according to Bradley's transcript.\nThe defense team maintains that Williams and Thomas were Demons' close friends and roommates and that there were no serious disputes between the men at the time of the mur\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: Juror In YNW Melly\u2019s Double Murder Trial Believes He\u2019s Innocent & Is Being \u2018Framed\u2019 For His Two Friends\u2019 Murders\ndate: 2023-09-08\nbody: After being on trial and charged with double murder, Florida rapper YNW Melly , 24, was recently sent back to Broward Main Jail, without bail, after the judge declared a mistrial due to a hung jury. Since, one single juror is claiming that YNW Melly\u2019s innocent and is being \u201cframed\u201d for his two friends\u2019 murders.\nRELATED : YNW Melly Allegedly Confessed To Killing 2 YNW Members, Their Families Sue For Millions\nAs we previously reported, YNW Melly, born Jamell Demons, was arrested in 2019 on first-degree murder charges for allegedly shooting two of his childhood friends: Anthony Williams and Christopher Thomas Jr. Both were aspiring rapers with the YNW collective and respectively known as YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy.\nPrior to the charges placed, the three men were being driven in a Jeep by Cortland Henry, known as YNW Bortlen, after a recording session in Fort Lauderdale on Oct. 26, 2018. Prosecutors alleged that Demons shot Williams and Thomas, while Henry is accused of being an accomplice. He is separately being tried, and is still awaiting said trial.\nRELATED : YNW Melly Prays And Blows Kiss To Victims\u2019 Families In Court During Murder Trial\nProsecutors alleged that Demons and Henry drove the bodies to an area near the Everglades before at the back and passenger seats from outside of the car, to make it appear as if they\u2019d been in a drive-by shooting. Prosecutors said that ballistics tests showed that the initial shots fired were from inside the car.\nPolice added that Henry drove to the emergency room at Memorial Hospital Miramar asking for help, claiming that Williams and Thomas had been shot in a drive-by. Both victims were then pronounced dead.\nRELATED : YNW Melly Trial: Judge Denies Defense\u2019s Motion For Mistrial, Juror Hospitalized\nWhile Broward County prosecutors were seeking the death penalty in Demons\u2019 double murder case, arguing that the shooting was part of gang action, the defense said this claim lacked credibility because Demons and the two victims were close friends. The defense argued that their client had no motive for the crime and that gun from the shooting was never recovered.\nDemons\u2019 double murder trial, which began nearly four-and-a-half years after being taken into custody, ended with a hung jury. After sitting through 19 days of arguments and testimonies, the jury deliberated for two days before announcing that they weren\u2019t able to reach a unanimous decision.\nSubsequently, Broward Circuit Court Judge John J. Murphy III thanked them for their efforts and declared a mistrial. Following the decision, it\u2019s been reported that Demons will be tried again for first-degree murder by the Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office. Demons still faces the possibility of execution if he is convicted in his retrial, which is due to begin next month.\nRELATED : YNW Melly\u2019s Double\n3. source quality: google\nHighlighted Answer from Google: Demons shot and killed two childhood friends, Christopher Thomas Jr. and Anthony Williams, in October of 2018\nProsecutors will retry double murder case against YNW Melly\n4. source quality: good\nProsecutors will retry double murder case against YNW Melly\nYNW Melly: Prosecutors will retry double murder case \u2013 NBC 6 South Florida\nSkip to content\nMain Navigation\nSearch\nSearch for:\nLocal\nWeather\nVideo\nNewsletters\nTV Listings\nLive TV\nTrending\nExpand\nYNW Melly\nProsecutors will retry double murder case against YNW Melly\nAfter a month, a judge declared a mistrial when jurors couldn't agree on a verdict\nBy\nMarissa Bagg\n\u2022\nPublished July 24, 2023\n\u2022\nUpdated on\nJuly 24, 2023\nat\n7:39 pm\nNBC Universal, Inc.\nIt\u2019s as if the month-long double murder trial against\nYNW Melly\nnever happened.\nOn Saturday, Judge John Murphy\ndeclared a mistrial\nwhen jurors couldn\u2019t agree on a verdict as to whether the South Florida rapper known \u2014 born Jamell Demons \u2014 was guilty or not guilty of double murder.\n\u201cWhat that means to me as a defense attorney who has tried dozens of jury trials, is there was somebody in that room that was \u2018gung-ho\u2019 that this should be an acquittal,\u201d said Joshua Rydell, a local criminal defense attorney following the case. \u201cThat\u2019s what this says to me.

The lawsuit argues that the county has failed to correctly assess property values and that this has resulted in a loss of tax revenue for the city. The county, along with its Director of Assessments Gail McCann Beatty and County Executive Frank White, are accused of failing to perform their duty to assess property taxes as required by Missouri law ([4], [5]).\n\n- One of the central issues in this lawsuit is the way new homes are taxed.

This process reportedly continues for several years after construction ([3]).\n\n- The lawsuit also alleges that the county is increasing assessments beyond the allowable percentage, failing to notify property owners of increases, failing to perform appropriate inspections, and failing to account for new construction in a proper and timely fashion ([2], [5]).\n\n- The Missouri Supreme Court is set to appoint a new judge for this case as all local judges on the 16th circuit have been recused to avoid potential conflicts of interest ([1]).\n\n- Mayor Baird expressed concerns that these assessment inaccuracies could erode public trust in the government and affect essential services if people are underpaying taxes ([1], [3]). </s><s> [INST] What has been the response from Jackson County officials to the allegations and the lawsuit?

{"question_id": 27, "query": "Has Mitch McConnell had any major health issues while in office?", "turns": ["This is the conversation history with the user: [INST] Mitch McConell freezes during press event [/INST] Based on the information I found, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, had an incident where he appeared to freeze during a press conference in Northern Kentucky on 30th August 2023. This is the second time such an incident has occurred, the first being in July 2023 during a press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nHere is a summary of the events:\n\n- The incident happened when McConnell was asked about his plans to run for re-election in 2026. After the question was repeated, he seemed to lose his train of thought and remained silent for about 30 seconds.\n- His aides stepped in to help, repeating the question and requesting a minute.\n- Once McConnell re-engaged, he moved on to another question about Kentucky Republican gubernatorial candidate Daniel Cameron, and he managed to comment on that.\n- He also took a question about former President Trump's latest indictment in Georgia but chose not to comment on it.\n- After the press conference, McConnell's office released a statement saying he would see a doctor.\n- It is noted that McConnell is 81 years old and had a similar episode in July 2023 in Washington, D.C.\n- According to Brian Monahan, a professor of medicine and pathology who serves as an attending physician for Congress, there is no evidence suggesting either incident resulted from a stroke or seizure.\n\nDespite these incidents, McConnell continues to serve as Senate GOP leader. However, some members of the Republican party have voiced displeasure with his current status following his latest freeze, including Majorie Taylor Greene, house representative from Georgia, and Josh Hawley, senator from Missouri. </s><s> [INST] What's McConnell's health history?

McConnell plans to serve his full term as Republican leader despite questions about his health\ndate: 2023-07-28\nbody: WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said he is \u201cfine\u201d since he froze up midsentence during a press conference on Wednesday. And now his office is trying to tamp down speculation that he might not fill out his term as leader because of his health.\nIn a statement, his office said McConnell appreciates the continued support of his colleagues and \u201cplans to serve his full term in the job they overwhelmingly elected him to do.\u201d\nThe statement, first reported by Politico, comes after McConnell, 81, has suffered health problems in recent months. At his weekly press conference this week, he froze and stared vacantly for about 20 seconds before his GOP colleagues standing behind him grabbed his elbows and asked if he wanted to go back to his office. He later returned to the news conference and answered questions as if nothing had happened.\nWhen asked about the episode, he said he was \u201cfine,\u201d a statement he repeated in a hallway to reporters later that day. Neither McConnell nor his office would answer questions about whether he got medical help afterward.\nEven as McConnell tried to brush off the concerns, the episode raised new questions among his colleagues about his health and also whether McConnell, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and has served as Republican leader since 2007, might soon step aside from his leadership post.\nHe was elected to a two-year term as leader in January by a large majority of his conference, despite an insurgent challenge from Florida Sen. Rick Scott. He would be up for re-election as leader again after the 2024 elections.\nBy then, he will have to decide also if he wants to run again for another Senate term. He is up for re-election in 2026.\nIn March, McConnell suffered a concussion and a broken rib after falling and hitting his head after a dinner event at a hotel. He didn\u2019t return to the Senate for almost six weeks. He has been using a wheelchair in the airport while commuting back and forth to Kentucky. And his speech has recently sounded more halting.\nBut McConnell, famously reticent and often private about his personal life and health, has said very little about what is going on.\nRepublican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said after Wednesday\u2019s episode that McConnell\u2019s job as leader calls for more transparency than it would for others.\n\u201cWe should find out, you know, fairly soon what happened and how serious it is,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have to tell you, Mitch is also, as an individual, a pretty private guy. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he talked to McConnell on Wednesday night and he seemed \u201cstrong and alert.\u201d But he said what happened at the news conference on Wednesday was disturb\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Mitch McConnell's Health Concerns Prompt Speculation on Senate Leadership\ndate: 2023-09-12\nbody: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recently found himself under the spotlight as concerns over his health surfaced following two incidents in which he froze up on camera. In the aftermath of these episodes, McConnell and his allies swiftly mobilized to counter any potential challenges to his leadership within the Senate Republican caucus.\nNotably, McConnell faced his first-ever leadership challenge last year when Senator Rick Scott of Florida ran against him but ultimately lost. The emergence of apparent health issues raised questions about whether insurgents within the party might use this vulnerability to mount another challenge against the 81-year-old McConnell.\nSenator Mitt Romney of Utah, a vocal supporter of McConnell, acknowledged the existing efforts to replace him, stating, \"There has been an effort on the part of some to replace him already.\" McConnell, recognizing the potential window of opportunity for his critics, took action by rallying his supporters.\nSenator John Barrasso, one of McConnell's top deputies, revealed that McConnell promptly informed him of his health issues after the August freeze, displaying his characteristic dry humor by remarking, \"I just had another one of those.\" However, McConnell knew that he had to take a more personal approach to address concerns about his health. He released a doctor's letter ruling out more severe diagnoses and held a private presentation for fellow senators to discuss his health.\nOne lingering question in the Senate GOP is whether McConnell's health concerns will persist into 2024, particularly as former President Donald Trump, his political foil within the party, continues to be a dominant figure in the race for the presidential nomination. It marks the first time in nearly two decades that Senate Republicans are openly contemplating a future without McConnell at the helm.\nDespite the speculations, McConnell's allies dismiss the notion that he might be forced to step down prematurely. They maintain that his internal strength remains intact. McConnell emerged from the recent health scares with his leadership firmly intact, as indicated by interviews with more than a dozen senators who participated in his leadership contest against Scott.\nMoreover, the unpredictability of whether and when another health incident might occur adds an element of uncertainty to the situation. A previous fall in March that resulted in a concussion demonstrated the challenges of predicting such occurrences.\nWhile Senator Scott declined to entertain the idea of challenging McConnell again, it is evident that should McConnell experience another freeze-up, he will likely face heightened scrutiny. McConnell expressed his discomfort with the nationwide fixation on his physical condition during a meeting with GOP senators, specifically criticizing doctors who offered diagnoses without proper knowledge of his condition.\nThe discussion surrounding McConnell's health also drew attention to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who raised doubts about McConnell's diagnosis by Capitol physician Brian Monahan. However, Paul\n3. source quality: good\nTop US Senate Republican McConnell to serve out ... - Reuters\nTop US Senate Republican McConnell to serve out term despite health concerns | Reuters\nSkip to main content\nExclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals\nLearn more about\nRefinitiv\nReuters home\nBreakingviews\nTechnology\nInvestigations\nMore\nMy View\nRegister\nUnited States\nTop US Senate Republican McConnell to serve out term despite health concerns\nReuters\nSeptember 6, 2023\n10:04 PM UTC\nUpdated ago\nWASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he plans to serve the rest of his two-year term as party leader and his full six-year term in office, allowing for the possibility that he would step down from leadership before leaving office.\nKEY QUOTE\n\"I am going plan to finish my term as leader and I'm going to finish my Senate term,\" McConnell told reporters.\nTHE TAKE\nTwo recent episodes in which McConnell, 81,\nfroze up\nwhile in public have raised questions about how long he will continue to serve and McConnell has offered\nfew details\nas to what caused the incidents.\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) walks to the Senate floor amid ongoing talks over government funding, as the threat of an October government shutdown looms on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 6, 2023.

STATION ESCALATORS\nNOW OPEN ON ADAMS ST. SIDE\nBROOKLYN HTS./CONCORD VILLAGE \u2014 THE ESCALATORS ON THE 90-YEAR-OLD HIGH STREET SUBWAY STATION\u2019S ADAMS STREET SIDE HAVE REOPENED, reported the Brooklyn Heights Association on Thursday, Sept. 21. The MTA completed its required 48-hour safety test for the two escalators that serve the A/C line station\u2019s Adams St. side in Concord Village. Work on the escalators on the Cadman Plaza West side of the station will begin within the next 10 days, the MTA reports.\nDuring that period, the entrance at Cadman Plaza West will remain open, and the staircase leading to and from the upper mezzanine to the lower mezzanine will be accessible. The stairwell has a number of small landings, or pauses between sets of steps, in this deep station that originally opened in June 1933.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\nNEWLY-ACCESSIBLE SUBWAY STATION OPENS\nWITH FULL FUNDING FROM MACY\u2019S\nDOWNTOWN BROOKLYN \u2014 MACY\u2019S DEPARTMENT STORE ON FULTON MALL HAS FUNDED AND BUILT A NEWLY-OPENED, FULLY-ACCESSIBLE SUBWAY STATION that is part of the building\u2019s history in Downtown Brooklyn. Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Thursday, Sept. 21, gathered in front of the Hoyt St. station (2 and 3 Trains) that is immediately adjacent to the iconic store. The full project includes the elevator and a staircase within a new street-level entrance to the station, which Macy\u2019s will maintain. This partnership is another example of the MTA engaging the private sector to improve station access without requiring MTA capital dollars on top of the 67 station accessibility upgrades included in the MTA\u2019s 2020-2024 Capital Plan.\nThe subway entrance itself is part of Macy\u2019s history, and was the transit system\u2019s first private one, according to the website ClassicNewYorkHistory.com. Abraham & Straus, the precursor to Macy\u2019s, built the station that led directly to the store\u2019s basement. That \u201cticket booth sold more than 5,000 subway tokens on opening day at five cents a token,\u201d reports the history site. For more information, see page 3.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\nCOMPTROLLER: STATE AGENCIES MUST IMPROVE\nOVERSIGHT OF NOURISH NEW YORK FUNDING\nSTATEWIDE \u2014 A PROGRAM THAT\u2019S DESIGNED TO HELP NEW YORK RESIDENTS AND AREA FARMERS ALLEVIATE HUNGER may have been hindered by the very agencies managing it, according to an audit that State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli released on Thursday, Sept. 21. Through the Nourish New York program (Nourish NY) that the New York State Department of Health and the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets jointly manage, regional food banks contract with DOH to receive these funds, allocating them to local soup kitchens, food pantries, and other community-based organizations to purchase New York grown farm products. Comptroller DiNapoli\u2019s audit found that DOH approved $22.7 million in purchases from May 2020 through March 2022, despite inadequate documentation proving the food products were grown in New York as required. DOH also failed to supply sufficient guidance to food relief organizations on coverable administrative costs.\nAuditors concluded DOH needs to improve its oversight, otherwise, funds could be improperly used for expenses not associated with Nourish NY.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\nTENTATIVE NYC SCHOOL BUS CONTRACT AGREEMENT REACHED\nCITYWIDE \u2014 THE TRANSIT UNION AND MAJOR SCHOOL BUS COMPANIES in NYC have reached a tentative contract agreement, averting a disruptive strike, according to a joint statement by NYC Council Transportation & Infrastructure Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers and Education Chair Rita Joseph. \u201cWe are glad the school bus companies and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1181 were able to come to a tentative agreement that avoids harmful disruptions for our students and families. We support increased wages and benefits for school bus drivers and a continuation of school bus services for over 80,000 students at this time,\u201d the officials said.\nThe officials warned, however, that drivers with the NYC School Bus Umbrella Services have yet to reach a deal.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\nNEW LEADERSHIP PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT\nBIPOC-LED ARTS GROUPS IN BROOKLYN\nBOROUGHWIDE \u2014 THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM AND THE JOE AND CLARA TSAI FOUNDATION\u2019S SOCIAL JUSTICE FUND (SJF) have launched a new ten-month program, the Brooklyn Arts Leadership Collaborative, to support the leaders of eight small and midsize BIPOC-led (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) arts organizations in Brooklyn. The Collaborative, which kicks off in October 2023, will provide critical support to the inaugural cohort of arts organization leaders, including holistic leadership development and assistance in building programs to achieve their social equity goals. Each of eight organizations will receive a grant of $25,000 from the Social Justice Fund: ARTE (Art Resistance Through Education), Black Girls Sew, Brooklyn United Music and Arts Program, Kyoung\u2019s Pacific Beat, \u00a1Oye!, Black Trans Femme Artist Collective, Rooted Theater Company and Redhawk Council.\nLeaders of Brooklyn nonprofits have long struggled to sustain their organizations due to a lack of investment in the sector. BIPOC-led nonprofits in particular have operated at the margins of sustainability, and some have ceased operations due to economic hardship.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\n1-YEAR-OLD BABY GIRL MURDERED IN CROWN HEIGHTS\nCROWN HEIGHTS \u2014 A 1-YEAR-\n2. source quality: unknown\ntitle: Free museum tours in New York, Brooklyn on Thursday New Museum of Contemporary Art Free Thursdays - Pay-What-You-Wish Admission\nDescription: New Museum of Contemporary Art - Free Thursdays Admission INFO below.

I apologize for the inconvenience. As soon as it's back up, I'd be more than happy to help you find the information you're looking for. </s><s> [INST] Try again later. [/INST] There are three main types of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic. Here is a brief explanation of each:\n\n1. Sedimentary Rocks: These are formed from pieces of other existing rock or organic material. There are three different types of sedimentary rocks: clastic, organic (biological), and chemical. For example, clastic sedimentary rocks like sandstone form from clasts or pieces of other rocks. Organic sedimentary rocks, like coal, form from hard, biological materials like plants, shells, and bones that are compressed into rock. Chemical sedimentary rocks, like limestone, halite, and flint, form from chemical precipitation.\n\n2. Metamorphic Rocks: These are rocks that have been changed from their original form by immense heat or pressure. They have two classes: foliated and nonfoliated. Foliated rocks have a layered appearance, while nonfoliated rocks do not have this feature.\n\n3. Igneous Rocks: These are formed when molten hot material cools and solidifies. They can be formed inside of the earth (intrusive or plutonic igneous rocks) or outside/on top of Earth\u2019s crust (extrusive or volcanic igneous rocks). Examples of common intrusive rocks include granite and diorite, while extrusive rocks include basalt and obsidian.\n\nIt's important to note that these rock types can be transformed into one another via different processes, part of what's known as the rock cycle. </s><s> \n\n[INST] You are a helpful QA robot.\nToday is 09-27-2023.\nGiven a question from a  user: Explain the rock cycle.\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\n1. source quality: unknown\nNCERT Notes: The Rock Cycle [Geography Notes For UPSC]\nNCERT Notes: Rock Cycle - Processes, Forces [Geography Notes For UPSC]\nLogin\nLive Quiz\nNEW\nLogin\n+91-9243500460\nNCERT Notes: The Rock Cycle [Geography Notes For UPSC]\nThere are three main types of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic.

Any rock can transform into any other rock by passing through one or more of these processes. This creates the rock cycle.\nQ2\nWhat is meant by rock cycle?\nThe rock cycle is the process by which rocks of one kind change into rocks of another kind. There are three main kinds of rocks: igneous rock, metamorphic rock, and sedimentary rock. It can melt into magma, erode into sediment, or be pressed tightly together to become metamorphic.\nFor the updated\nUPSC Syllabus\nfor the prelims and mains examination candidates can refer to the linked article, and accordingly, start their preparation.\nVisit BYJU\u2019S for exam updates, study material and preparation tips.\nOther Related Links\nIAS General Studies Notes Links\nComments\nLeave a Comment\nCancel reply\nYour Mobile number and Email id will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\n*\nSend OTP\nDid not receive OTP?\nRequest OTP on\nVoice Call\n*\n*\nWebsite\n*\nGrade/Exam\nClass 1\nClass 2\nClass 3\nClass 4\nClass 5\nClass 6\nClass 7\nClass 8\nClass 9\nClass 10\nClass 11\nClass 12\nIAS\nCAT\nBank Exam\nGATE\n*\n*\nPost My Comment\nJoin BYJU'S Learning Program\nSubmit\nDaily Updates \u2013 13/09/2023\nUPSC Mains DAF 2023 Released\nDaily Free Current Affairs Notes\nWeekly Updates\nWeekly GK and Current Affairs Quiz Sep 09 - Sep 15\nView more...\nMonthly Updates\nGist of Yojana - August 2023\nGist of Kurukshetra - August 2023\nUPSC Monthly Magazine - August 2023\nUPSC Monthly Question Bank - August 2023\nLatest Current Affairs\nLast Updated: 03-08-2023\nSeptember Archive \u2013 Daily Posts\nSeptember 2023\nM\nT\nW\nT\nF\nS\nS\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\u00ab Aug\nCOURSES\nEXAMS\nCLASSES\nKids Learning\nClass 1\nst\n- 3\nrd\nClass 4\nth\n- 5\nth\nClass 6\nth\n- 10\nth\nClass 11\nth\n- 12\nth\nBYJU'S Tuition Centre\nEXAM PREPARATION\nRESOURCES\nCOMPANY\nFOLLOW US\nFREE TEXTBOOK SOLUTIONS\nSTATE BOARDS\nMadhya Pradesh\nWest Bengal\nFOLLOW US\n\u00a9 2023, BYJU'S.

It is a known fact that dogs are a man\u2019s best friend.\nDogs that end up in rescue shelters or adoption agencies are there for a lot of reasons. Their owners may have fallen ill. Their owners may have become financially ill-equipped to have pets. Some dogs have been victims of abuse.\nSome use them as breeding machines. They sell puppies as a business for income alone. When you adopt them, you are giving them a new healthy life.\nDogs are great for building emotional bonds. They can brighten up your gloomy days. So, it is a win-win situation for both of you.\n1. How Is Chicago Doing in Terms of Dog Adoption?\nIn 2017, there were a whopping 559 cases of dog adoption in Chicago. But, the number has reduced to 86 during the first quarter of 2021. Nevertheless, dog adoption has become a prevalent trend. In fact, many people have got their first dogs during the pandemic.\nAdopting dogs can be a life-changer. There are multiple options to explore for dog adoption in Chicago.\nRead on to learn about the dog adoption process in Chicago. We seek to answer every question you might have about this.\n2. Pet Adoption Rules in Chicago\nThe rules for pet adoption in Chicago are pretty basic, but let\u2019s have a quick look at them:\nYou need to be a citizen of the state.\nYou need to meet the age prescribed by the animal shelter.\nYou must only adopt from authorized sources. This means that you need to check whether the adoption center complies with the state law for animal adoption.\nYou need to have the minimum resources to ensure that you can provide the adopted pet with a healthy living condition.\n3. Popular Breeds in Chicago\nPeople adopt or buy different breeds. But, dog adoption in Chicago has been showing a preference for the French bulldog. American Kennel Club reports Golden retrievers, Labradors, German shepherds, and bulldogs are among other favorites. But the thing about adoption is that you may not always get your favorite pick from the centers.\nChicago\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: Pet Sitter Chicago, IL: Out-U-Go! Pet Care\nname: Out-U-Go!

Now, at its Cloud Next conference, Google announced that it will launch the A3 into general availability next month.\nWe\u2019ll have to see if Google Cloud will be able to keep up with demand for these chips, given that their focus is on training and serving generative AI models and large language models.\nWhen it announced the A3 last year, Google Cloud said that it would offer up to 26 exaflops of AI performance and, thanks in part to the custom IPUs, up to 10x more network bandwidth compared to the previous-generation A2 machines.\n\u201cA3 is really purpose-built to train, tune and serve incredibly demanding and scalable generative AI workloads and large language models,\u201d Mark Lohmeyer, the VP and GM for computer and ML infrastructure at Google Cloud, said during a press conference ahead of today\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt leverages a number of unique Google innovations including Google networking technologies such as their infrastructure processing and offloads, that help support the massive scale and performance that these workloads require.\u201d\n2. source quality: unknown\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Google Cloud With H100-Powered A3 VMs\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Google Cloud With H100-Powered A3 VMs\nHOME\nMAIL\nNEWS\nFINANCE\nYahoo Finance\nYahoo Finance\nSign in\nMail\nSign in\nto view your mail\nFinance\nWatchlists\nMy Portfolio\nMarkets\nNews\nVideos\nYahoo Finance Plus\nScreeners\nPersonal Finance\nCrypto\nIndustries\nContact Us\nU.S. markets close in 3 hours 4 minutes\nS&P 500\n4,513.04\n+5.38\n(+0.12%)\nDow 30\n34,794.12\n+72.21\n(+0.21%)\nNasdaq\n14,029.60\n-5.37\n(-0.04%)\nRussell 2000\n1,923.51\n+23.84\n(+1.25%)\nCrude Oil\n85.32\n+1.69\n(+2.02%)\nGold\n1,964.30\n-1.60\n(-0.08%)\nSilver\n24.59\n-0.22\n(-0.87%)\nEUR/USD\n1.0787\n-0.0058\n(-0.54%)\n10-Yr Bond\n4.1850\n+0.0920\n(+2.25%)\nGBP/USD\n1.2588\n-0.0086\n(-0.68%)\nUSD/JPY\n146.1390\n+0.6170\n(+0.42%)\nBitcoin USD\n25,837.07\n-516.16\n(-1.96%)\nCMC Crypto 200\n558.56\n-5.96\n(-1.06%)\nFTSE 100\n7,464.54\n+25.41\n(+0.34%)\nNikkei 225\n32,710.62\n+91.28\n(+0.28%)\nZacks\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Google Cloud With H100-Powered A3 VMs\nRead full article\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nGOOGL\nNVDA\nZacks Equity Research\nSeptember 1, 2023 at 8:44 AM\n\u00b7\n3 min read\nIn this article:\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nGOOGL\nWatchlist\nNVDA\nAlphabet\n\u2019s GOOGL Google is making efforts to strengthen its cloud segment on the back of innovative products.\nThis is evident from its latest move of making its much-awaited A3 virtual machines (VM) generally available from this month.\nA3, which was launched last year, is powered by\nNVIDIA\n\u2019s NVDA H100 Tensor Core GPUs that feature a transformer engine capable of addressing trillion-parameter models.\nA3 VMs are comprised of dual next-generation 4th Gen Intel Xeon scalable processors, eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs per VM and 2TB host memory.\nIt delivers 3.6 TB per second of bisectional bandwidth, which, in turn, enhances the supercomputing powers of the users.\nMore precisely, A3 VMs are designed to cater well to the growing demand for generative AI workloads and large language models.\nWe note that Google\u2019s partnership with NVIDIA for A3 VMs is likely to bolster its supercomputing capabilities.\nGoogle is well-poised to gain strong momentum among AI innovators and enterprises building advanced AI models.\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nStrengthening Google Cloud Offerings\nThe latest move has bolstered Google Cloud offerings.\nAlong with the general availability of A3 VMs, the company strengthened its Kubernetes offerings by launching an enterprise version of its Google Kubernetes Engine (\u201cGKE\u201d) at a Google Cloud Next event.\nGKE Enterprise aids enterprises in complex workload management while running multiple clusters by combining GKE with Anthos, Google\u2019s container platform. It is designed to address complicated Kubernetes environments as it features security and governance tools and service mesh management.\nGoogle also announced the general availability of its generative AI-backed helper, Duet AI, for Gmail, Drive, Docs and more.\nAny organization using Google Workspace will be able to benefit from this AI helper, which boasts several new capabilities. It acts as a meeting assistant for Google Chat, a document summarizer and also allows personalization for Gmail's smart replies.\nStory continues\nWe believe strengthening the Google Cloud segment remains a major Alphabet.

The weather system is expected to gain strength and potentially become a powerful Category 4 hurricane, likely to be named 'Hurricane Lee' ([3], [4], [7]).\n- The conditions for the depression are favorable for strengthening, including low wind shear, ample moisture, and warm ocean temperatures ([4]).\n- The storm is forecasted to take a general westward track toward the northeastern Caribbean, possibly affecting areas such as the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Antigua, and Barbuda ([4]). However, the latest findings indicate that the hurricane might turn north, potentially sparing Florida ([3]).\n- Despite potential initial hindrance from some sinking air present in the Atlantic, this factor is not expected to significantly inhibit the storm's development ([4]).\n- The potential impact on the United States and Atlantic Canada appears uncertain at this time. It will depend on the storm's final track and prevailing wind patterns ([4]).\n- The storm is currently producing winds at around 35 miles per hour. If it becomes a hurricane, the winds could reach between 130 to 140 miles per hour ([3]).\n  \nPlease note that while the above information provides a forecast, weather conditions can change rapidly.

Choosing to buy or rent, though, is a major decision that affects your financial health, lifestyle, and personal goals. Whichever option you choose depends entirely on your lifestyle and financial situation. Both require a regular income (so you can afford the payments and associated costs) and may also require a certain degree of effort to maintain.\nBut there are several differences that make renting and owning property distinctly different. Renting a property doesn't come with all the responsibilities associated with\nhomeownership\nand you have more flexibility, as you aren't necessarily tied down to your property. Owning your home gives you a sizeable\ninvestment\n, but it does come at a big cost\u2014both upfront and over the long run.\nOwning a home isn\u2019t always better than renting, and renting is not always as simple as it seems. Here, we highlight some of the key differences between renting and buying.\nKey Takeaways\nWhether you choose to rent or buy your home depends on your financial situation, lifestyle, and personal goals.\nBoth provide you with a place to live and require regular income in order to make the payments.\nRenting offers flexibility, predictable monthly expenses, and someone to handle repairs.\nHomeownership brings intangible benefits, such as a sense of stability and pride of ownership, along with the tangible ones of tax deductions and equity.\nRenting doesn't mean you\u2019re throwing away money every month, and owning doesn't always help you build wealth in the long run.\nInvestopedia / Alex Dos Diaz\nRenting a Home\nThe biggest myth about renting is that you're throwing away money every month. This is not true. After all, you need a place to live, and that always costs money in one way or another. While it's true that you aren't building\nequity\nwith monthly rent payments, not all of the costs of homeownership always go toward building equity.\nWhen you rent, you know exactly your housing costs each month. This amount is indicated on your lease so you can plan accordingly. In some cases, your\nlandlord\nmay also include other costs within that amount, such as utilities, storage, and\nhomeowner association\n(HOA) fees if you live in a condominium.\nAs a renter, you may face rent increases each time your\nlease\nis up for renewal. These rent increases can be even steeper if you live in certain parts of town. This may not be the case if you live in an area with rent ceilings and rent control, which limit how much a landlord can increase the rent, if at all.\nRenting means you're able to move whenever your lease ends. However, it also means you could have to move suddenly if your landlord decides to sell\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Renting vs. Buying a House \u2013 How to Make a Decision, Pros & Cons\ndate: 2023-06-15\nbody: Given the hefty upfront costs associated with purchasing a home, most young people begin their independent lives renting an apartment. As they build careers, save money, and start families, many choose to buy a home. On the other end of the age spectrum, homeowners nearing retirement may choose to sell their family homes, downsize, and become renters once more.\nSince the middle of the 20th century, the U.S. homeownership rate has fluctuated between 62% and 70%. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, it\u2019s currently around 66%, up from multi-decade lows in the late 2010s. The homeowner vacancy rate is about 0.7%, compared with a rental vacancy rate of about 7%. The rental vacancy rate is usually higher than the homeowner vacancy rate, so this gap isn\u2019t particularly unusual or surprising.\nRecent U.S. Homeownership Trends & How to Think About Homeownership Today\nIn fact, despite recent gains, the homeownership rate has been depressed for many years. The decline dates back to the housing bust and financial crisis of the late 2000s, but it has several root causes:\nAging Baby Boomers moving from owner-occupied homes to cozier rental units\nHistorically high housing prices, making homeownership less affordable\nHigh mortgage interest rates, compounding affordability issues\nHigh student debt loans that prevent many younger buyers from saving enough for a down payment\nRegardless of the big-picture forces that affect homeownership rates, determining whether and when to purchase a home is a personal choice that demands careful deliberation. This decision varies from market to market \u2013 what makes sense in Peoria might not work in San Francisco, and vice versa. Also, because American culture idealizes homeownership to a certain extent, emotional and social pressures can affect the decision almost as much as financial concerns.\nWhether you\u2019re a renter interested in buying a home or a homeowner wondering whether renting makes more sense at this point in your life, it\u2019s never a bad time to evaluate the relative costs, benefits, and drawbacks of owning versus renting your home.\nCosts of Buying & Owning Your Home\nFirst, consider the costs of buying and owning a home of your own. We can break these costs down into three categories: upfront costs, recurring costs, and one-off costs that may arise during your time as a homeowner.\nUpfront & Closing Costs\nBuying a home entails numerous upfront costs. Some are paid out-of-pocket after the seller accepts your purchase offer, while others are paid at closing.\nEarnest Money\nTo show the seller you\u2019re serious about buying the property, it\u2019s customary to accompany your purchase offer with an \u201cearnest money\u201d check. Earnest money generally ranges from 1% to 3% of the home\u2019s purchase price, depending on local market conditions and the seller\u2019s preference. After accepting the offer, the seller deposits the earnest money funds into an escrow account, and the amount is credited against your closing costs.\nDown Payment\nYour down payment is the percentage of the home\u2019s purchase price that you pay upfront, typically at closing. You need to specify a down payment amount in your purchase offer, though you can change it prior to closing if the seller agrees. Your down payment amount varies widely based on your credit profile, local market conditions, and the type of mortgage loan you\u2019re approved for, but typically ranges from 3.5% (chiefly for FHA loans) to more than 20% of the purchase price.\nHome Appraisal\nTo ensure that the offer price matches the actual value of the home, lenders require a home appraisal prior to approving the loan. Appraisal costs, typically $300 to $500, are paid during or before the appraisal.\nHome Inspection\nLicensed home inspectors are trained to find potential problems and defects that might not be apparent to an inexperienced buyer doing a casual walk-through. For this reason, buyers are strongly encouraged to get one, even though private lenders rarely make loan approval conditional on a completed home inspection. The cost is similar to the appraisal and is usually paid at the inspection.\nProperty Taxes\nSince property owners pay property taxes upfront, usually in six-month increments, you need to compensate the seller for taxes paid on the period between the closing date and the end of the current tax period. This expense varies widely based on your local tax rate and the closing date. You\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Cooks in the U.S. would use them to flavor soup stock or simply toss them out\u2014a fact, learned researching this story, that disturbed me at a core, uniquely American level, though in no way surprised me (sustainability, for all its buzzword-ery, is a very new mainstream concept).\nThen a little bar in Buffalo dropped them in the deep fryer and slathered them in a buttery hot sauce. Wings became a national staple. The lowly wing went from the cheapest cut\u2014a freebie, an apparent nuisance\u2014to the most expensive part of the bird. In 2022 on Super Bowl Sunday,\nAmericans ate 1.42 billion wings\n.\nDespite not having a team, most San Diegans still recall that the Super Bowl happens every year. So I set out to find the best wings in the city. Should you still support the football arts, and wish to outsource the food for any related parties, this list should help.\nI\u2019m not sure the exact minute I began to regret this assignment, but I\u2019m certain I was gazing down at a catacomb of bones. So many of them, delicious and exhausting. It turns out that\u2014unlike\nmy earlier search for the best soup dumplings\n\u2014almost every single restaurant in San Diego does a riff on chicken wings. To feel good about the depth of my journalistic quest, I felt I had to try at least 15 of them. And now I need salad and a bath.\nA few observations on wing culture. First, wing joints are like corporations in that they tend to talk about diversity but don\u2019t really practice it. Some will have up to 60 flavors, but not let you mix and match with a single order. The first place to let you order eight wings\u2014every one a different flavor\u2014will become my spiritual center. Second, there\u2019s a lot of dry wings out there. And wings that are far too sweet.\nI get it, we\u2019re Americans, we wake up and mainline sugar. But a peace accord must be struck between sweet and savory, and if it leans one direction, I feel pretty strongly it should should be savory (\"chicken candy\" is not popular, probably for a reason). Third, restaurants that specialize in wings (or barbecue, for that matter, or any messy hand-held food) should be required to plant a tree every week to offset their napkinification of the American landscape.\nMy methodology: First, I queried food friends and social media friends for their recommendations on the city\u2019s best. Some came up multiple times and could not be ignored. I cross-referenced the rest with a little research, and told friends their diets had been discontinued because I needed help with this. I did not separate Buffalo wings from Asian-style wings.\nAll told, we tried 18 places with a reputation for thriving in the wing arts:\nO.B. Noodle House\n, Dirty Birds, Phuong Trang, Cross Street Chicken, Fort Oak,\nShank & Bone\n, Royal Mandarin, Canyon Sports Club, Mandarin Canton, Golden Chopsticks, Epic Wings, URBN, Good Seed Food Company, Tomcat Lounge, Reagle Beagle, Buffalo Wings Star, Bonchon, and City Dragon.\nI feel it\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Buffalo wing star\nDescription: This casual eatery known for wings, tenders & ribs has a selection of sauces & standard BBQ sides.\nOverall rating is 4.2\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nFriday 10 AM\u201311 PM\nSaturday 10 AM\u201311 PM\nSunday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nMonday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nTuesday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nWednesday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nAddress: 7621 Linda Vista Rd, San Diego, CA 92111\n3. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Buffalo Wild Wings\nDescription: Chain dishing up wings, tenders & burgers, plus sauces ranging from sweet to very spicy.\nOverall rating is 3.8\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant, American restaurant, Bar & grill, Takeout Restaurant, Restaurant, Sports bar\nOpen Hours: Thursday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nFriday 11 AM\u201312 AM\nSaturday 11 AM\u201312 AM\nSunday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nMonday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nTuesday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nWednesday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nAddress: 3615 Midway Dr, San Diego, CA 92110\n4. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Dirty Birds\nDescription: Sports bar wins fans with happy-hour deals on bites & brews in a woodsy-chic room with TVs galore.\nOverall rating is 4.4\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant, American restaurant, Bar, Bar & grill, Restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 12\u201310 PM\nFriday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nSaturday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nSunday 9:30 AM\u201310 PM\nMonday 12\u201310 PM\nTuesday 12\u201310 PM\nWednesday 12\u201310 PM\nAddress: 4656 Mission Blvd, San Diego, CA 92109\n5. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Epic Wings\nDescription: Counter-serve local chain that offers boneless & bone-in Buffalo wing combo meals.\nOverall rating is 4.4\nCategories: Restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nFriday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nSaturday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nSunday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nMonday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nTuesday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nWednesday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nAddress: 3904 Convoy St Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92111\n6. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Wings mix\nDescription: Casual eatery serving wings, ribs & tenders with a variety of sauces, plus various sides.\nOverall rating is 4.2\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant, Barbecue restaurant, Restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nFriday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nSaturday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nSunday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nMonday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nTuesday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nWednesday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nAddress: 2940 El Cajon Blvd, San Diego, CA 92104\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Coming from a musical family, she quickly fell in love with the art of movement.\n\"My main dance style that I really fell in love with was New York style Mambo on 2. Normal social salsa dancing is done on one,\" Pantoja said. \"With New York-style mambo, on two you are actually stepping on the two beat with your left foot, and when the men lead, they actually follow our count as opposed to us following theirs.\"\nWhen she came to Pennsylvania, she brought her passion for the New York-style salsa with her.\nShe teaches mambo cardio, hip hop, and salsa at Move It Studio in downtown Lancaster.\nMove It is one of the only Latinx-owned fitness and dance studios in the region.\nMarie Cleaves Rothacker, the owner of the studio, said she experienced a lot of the harshness of growing up in the ballet world. When she opened Move It, she wanted the place to feel like home.\n\"We are about empowering the full person, and you deserve it. You deserve to treat yourself to movement that feels healthy and empowering and to connecting with other people who are doing the same,\" Rothacker said.\nThe studio offers a variety of fitness and dance classes.\nPantoja will be directing the Latinx portion of the One World Festival in November with a mambo jazz routine performed by Move It Studio.

He didn\u2019t just say what I think he did, did he?\u201d\nThe post refers to one of Eminem\u2019s most popular songs, \u201cThe Real Slim Shady,\u201d released in 2000.\nBMI did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nRamaswamy grabbed headlines when he rapped Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d onstage at the Iowa State Fair.

In 2015, Neil Young\u2019s longtime manager said Donald Trump was not authorized to use \"Rockin\u2019 in the Free World\" in his presidential candidacy announcement. Fifteen years earlier, George W.

According to the letter obtained by the Daily Mail, Eminem\u2019s lawyers recently reached out to BMI and demanded that it remove the 2024 Republican presidential hopeful\u2019s ability to use his music of any sort at campaign events.\nA spokesperson for the music licenser informed his campaign lawyer that the organization \u201creceived communications from Marshall B. Mathers, III, professionally known as Eminem, objecting to the Vivek Ramaswamy campaign\u2019s use of Eminem\u2019s musical compositions (the \u2018Eminem Works\u2019) and requesting that BMI remove all Eminem Works from the agreement.\u201d It continued, \u201cThis letter serves as notice that the Eminem Works are excluded from the agreement effective immediately. BMI will consider any performance of the Eminem Works by the Vivek 2024 campaign from this date forward to be a material breach of the agreement for which BMI reserves all rights and remedies with respect thereto.\u201d\nAccording to a statement provided to HuffPost, a spokesperson for Ramaswamy said they will obey \u201cThe Real Slim Shady\u201d hitmaker\u2019s request. \u201cVivek just got on the stage and cut loose. To the American people\u2019s chagrin, we will have to leave the rapping to the Real Slim Shady,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin wrote in an email.\nDuring an interview with POLITICO back in July, Ramaswamy told the media outlet that he has always been inspired by Eminem, as he used to perform \u201cLose Yourself\u201d at Harvard open-mic nights under the stage name Da Vek. \u201cHe\u2019s growing up in the trailers, with a single mom, and he wants to make it. He\u2019s going to use the moment to do it. He feels like he\u2019s going to use the moment to do it, he seizes it and then he makes it happen, and I thought it was a pretty cool story,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in a trailer, but I also didn\u2019t grow up in the same circumstances that most of my peers at Harvard did, either. I aspired to achieve what many of their parents did.

However, it's the first time this many representatives are in the city at one time.\nMore than 30 representatives were in town for several hours of meetings and tours at the venue after Houston was awarded host city status last June. NRG is expected to host between five to eight matches. FIFA's upcoming World Cup is anticipated to be the biggest World Cup event ever, with cities across the U.S., Mexico and Canada hosting games.\nChris Canetti, the president of the Houston 2026 World Cup Bid Committee, told KHOU 11 their still in the planning stages.\n\"We're now less than three years away from the World Cup coming to Houston and I think today is a significant moment in planning and seeing that things are ramping up and moving forward,\" Canetti said.\nAs for the next big announcement, Canetti said that'll come before the end of the year when we'll find out exactly how many games Houston will host and what rounds the city will host.\n\"We've got a lot of work to do, but our job is really to take what exists here locally and put a World Cup into that,\" said FIFA World Cup '26 Chief Strategy and Planning Officer Amy Hopfinger.\nHopfinger said there were several factors that contributed to Houston getting chosen to host games, including the city's diversity, weather and great stadium with a roof.\n\"It's a big hurdle to host such an international event like this, but we're ready for it,\" said Hari County Sports and Convention Corp. CEO Ryan Walsh.\nThe event is expected to have a massive impact on the economy in Houston. It's projected to bring in more than $1 billion to the area. But, for the hosting committee, its lasting impact is just as important.\n\"One of our visions behind this is after the games are over, what is the legacy that's left in our city,\" Canetti said. \"How can we use this World Cup to help make Houston a better place at the end of the day.\"\nMichelle Choi on social media: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n2. source quality: unknown\ntitle: 'video game tournaments in Humble, Texas: Misfits Gaming'\ndate: Sun, Oct 29, 1\u202fPM CDT\ndescription: Since 2001, eSeats.com is a trusted reseller of Misfits Gaming tickets.

In this role, she managed millions of dollars in CDC, county and private grant funding for HIV prevention programs and led over 25 full-time employees. She also directed the center\u2019s Clean Syringe Exchange Program, HIV and Transgender Care and Support Services, and oversaw the implementation of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) navigation and research studies.

Here are the important details:\n\n- The ACC Board of Directors voted on this decision on September 1, 2023.\n- The addition of these universities expands the ACC's reach to the Pacific Ocean, with the league now having 18 members in total.\n- Cal, SMU, and Stanford will join the ACC as full members with full voting participation.\n- The effective dates for their inclusion are July 1, 2024, for SMU and August 2, 2024, for Stanford and Cal.\n- The addition of these schools has resulted in a significant contraction of the Pac-12 league, which is now left with only two teams: Oregon State and Washington State.\n- This expansion is expected to enhance and strengthen the ACC and increase its media rights revenue from its long-term deal with ESPN.\n- There are concerns about the travel burdens for student-athletes due to the geographic spread of the ACC. To mitigate this, the ACC is considering the use of Dallas as a neutral site for some games.\n\nIf you have other questions about this topic or need more specific information, feel free to ask. </s><s> \n\n[INST] You are a helpful QA robot.\nToday is 09-27-2023.\nGiven a question from a  user: Explain the revenue distribution model. add some Emojis to the answer\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\n1. source quality: good\nACC becomes latest super conference, expanding by adding Stanford ...\nACC becomes latest super conference, expanding by adding Stanford, Cal from disintegrating Pac-12 - ABC7 Los Angeles\nABC7 Eyewitness News\nWatch Now\nWATCH\nLIVE\nEDIT\nLog In\nWatch\nApps\nLocal News\nCategories\nStation Info\nshows\nFollow Us:\nWelcome,\nYour Account\nLog Out\nSPORTS\nACC becomes latest super conference, expanding by adding Stanford, Cal from disintegrating Pac-12\nSaturday, September 2, 2023\nEMBED <>\nMore Videos\n<iframe width=\"476\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://abc7.com/video/embed/?pid=13729080\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference voted to add Stanford, California and SMU next year, providing a landing spot for two more schools from the disintegrating Pac-12 and creating a fourth super conference in major college sports.\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference voted Friday to add Stanford, California and SMU next year, providing a landing spot for two more schools from the disintegrating Pac-12 and creating a fourth super conference in major college sports.\nThe move provides the ACC a windfall of revenue for its current members.\n\"It really is a transformational day for the ACC,\" Commissioner Jim Phillips said.\nStarting in August 2024, the league with Tobacco Road roots in North Carolina will increase its number of football schools to 17 and 18 in most other sports, with Notre Dame remaining a football independent.\nThe ACC needed 12 of its 15 members to approve expansion, and the vote was not unanimous.\n\"I can tell you when we left that call today, everybody was in a really good place and felt really good about the process,\" Phillips said.\nNorth Carolina and Florida State both voted no. The Seminoles said the move did not fully address its concerns about the ACC's revenue distribution model.\nReggie Bush sues NCAA over suggestion he was part of 'pay-for-play' plan\nEMBED <>\nMore Videos\n\"All three schools are outstanding academic and athletic institutions, and our vote against expansion does not reflect on their quality,\" Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said. \"We look forward to earning new revenue through the ACC's success incentives initiative, based on our continued excellence. We're grateful to the league for continuing to listen to our concerns.\"\nLike the Big Ten and Big 12, the ACC now will have members in at least three time zones.\nIt will span from Boston in the Northeast to Miami in South Florida, out to Dallas in the heart of the Southwest and up to Northern California, where Stanford and Cal reside. Notre Dame is currently the westernmost ACC school in South Bend, Indiana, with Louisville the farthest west among football members.\nThe ACC becomes the fourth league, along with the Southeastern Conference, Big Ten and Big 12, to have at least 16 football-playing members, starting in 2024.\nThe formation of the sprawling leagues has raised concerns about everything from the impact on athletes' travel to the changing recruiting landscape and the lost rivalries treasured by fans now facing different destinations if they want to cheer on their teams.\nStanford said it expects 22 of its 36 sports to have either no or minimal scheduling changes as the 2024 schedules are set.\n\"The ACC is really interested in using Dallas as a place where teams might come together to have games to minimize the impact of travel on both eastern members and Cal and Stanford,\" Cal Chancellor Carol Christ told reporters.\nThe move seems to signal an end to this wave of realignment among the nation's wealthiest and most powerful conferences after three years of turbulent movement that has whittled the so-called Power Five down to four.\n\"We've gone from regional-based conferences to national, coast-to-coast conferences,\" Phillips said. \"Either you get busy or you get left behind.\"\nFor the Bay Area schools, it was a marriage of desperation after the Pac-12 was picked apart by the Big Ten and Big 12.\n\"Conference affiliations and the broadcast revenue they generate provide key financial support for the wide array of sports that Stanford offers,\" athletic director Bernard Muir said. \"Joining the ACC will ensure the Power Conference competitive infrastructure and long-term media revenues that are critical for our student-athletes to compete.\"\nFor the ACC, adding three schools will increase media rights revenue from its long-term deal with ESPN and allow the conference to spread much of that new money to existing members.\nNew conference members typically - though not always - forgo a full share of revenue for several years upon entry.\nCal and Stanford will receive a partial share of ACC Tier 1 media revenue - estimated at about $25 million annually - for the next nine years before getting a full payment in the final three years of the conference's deal with ESPN, according to a person familiar with the terms. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the ACC and the schools have not disclosed the finances.\nCal and Stanford will get a 30% share in the first seven years, followed by 70% in year eight and 75% in year nine before getting the full amount, the person said.\nAnother person with direct knowledge of SMU's decision said the Dallas school currently in the American Athletic Conference will forgo all ACC media rights distribution for nine years. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the school was not making its strategy public.\nSMU President R. Gerald Turner said the school's revenues will be higher over time, and that ACC revenues will be part of the increase.\nAll three schools will immediately get full revenue shares from the ACC Network, the College Football Playoff, bowl games and NCAA men's basketball tournament units.\n\"You have the championships, the CFP fund that are coming in, part of what they've created is an incentive plan that we're all in,\" Turner said, referring also to Stanford and Cal. \"There are more ways to get funding than just the media plan.\"\nThe ACC has been generating record revenue hauls, yet is trailing the Big Ten and Southeastern conferences and staring at an even greater gap as those leagues have new TV deals kick in. The ACC's deal runs through 2036.\nThe ACC reported nearly $617 million in total revenue for the 2021-22 season, according to tax documents. That included distributing an average of $39.4 million to full members, with Notre Dame receiving a partial share (roughly $17.4 million) as a football independent.\nYet the Big Ten reported $845.6 million in total revenue (an average of $58 million in school distributions) and the SEC reported about $802 million in revenue ($49.9 million per school) for that same time period.\nThe ACC outgained the Big 12 (by roughly $136 million) in total revenue for third among the Power Five that season, though Big 12 schools received more money per school (roughly $43.6 million) with the league having just 10 members.\nThe angst over revenue led the ACC to announce plans for schools to keep more money based on their postseason success that has typically been evenly distributed to league teams.\nThe sticking point on\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

The deal is fully-guaranteed with a player option for the final year according to reports.\nVanderbilt was part of the trade package that sent Russell Westbrook to the Clippers. The 24-year-old out of Kentucky averaged 7.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game in the 2023-24 season. Vanderbilt's defense played a key role in the Lakers' Western Conference Finals run.\nWhat Vanderbilt lacks in offensive explosiveness, he makes up for with his ability to defend a wide range of athletes. He will likely contend for a spot in the starting five with Rui Hachimura, who the Lakers signed to a three-year contract worth $51 million after the 2023 season.\nVanderbilt missed the first 17 games of his only season at Kentucky with a foot injury. He proceeded to average just 17 minutes per game while grabbing 7.9 rebounds and scoring 5.9 points on average.\nThe Lakers will look to build on last year's performance as Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Austin Reaves and D'Angelo Russell will round out the starting five.\nAre you following us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or LA Sports Report yet?

According to the 24-year-old, their turnaround was prompted by a February game against the Dallas Mavericks when the Lakers erased a 27-point lead.\n\"That game was definitely the turning point of where we were at,\" Vanderbilt said in his appearance on the Run Your Race podcast . \"We were in a must-win mode for the rest of the season from that point, and that game kind of solidified us. It got us over the hump even though LeBron got hurt at that game, it kind of set us back a little bit. But at that point, everything was clicking.\"\nVando's best game as a Laker\nThe reason why this game against the Mavs was such a big deal for Vadnerbilt and the Lakers is that they realized that they had what it took to overcome a hot shooting start by the opponent that resulted in a 27-point lead.\nLed by Vaderbilt's 15 points and game-high 17 rebounds, the Lakers completed the biggest comeback in franchise history for the last 20 years. It also marked the largest comeback of the 2022-2023 NBA season.\n\"To be down 20, a fresh new team, but for us to come together and come back from 20 points on a team like that, we were like okay, we knew we were something serious,\" Vanderbilt said.\nVando's performance in this particular game perfectly depicted what he brings best to the team.\n3. source quality: good\ntitle: Jarred Vanderbilt Feels Game 2 Was Lakers\u2019 Best Chance In Western Conference Finals Against Nuggets\ndate: 2023-09-20\nbody: Jarred Vanderbilt was a player that many teams kept an eye on at the trade deadline in February due to his tenacious defense and the energy he provides whenever he is on the court. When the Los Angeles Lakers were able to acquire Vanderbilt, Malik Beasley and D\u2019Angelo Russell in the three-team trade with the Utah Jazz and Minnesota Timberwolves, the consensus was the Lakers got a steal for what they gave up.\nIt was not long before Lakers fans saw the immediate defensive impact Vanderbilt had with his debut coming against the Golden State Warriors, guarding Stephen Curry. A 6\u20198\u2033 forward who is agile with long arms and can guard point guards and forwards was the skillset the Lakers were looking for all season long with an undersized roster.\nL.A. would go on to make a deep run in the postseason with Vanderbilt taking the tasks of guarding Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant and Curry once again before reaching the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers would then play the Denver Nuggets and would ultimately get swept. A couple of months removed from the series, Vanderbilt appeared on NBA player Theo Pinson\u2019s \u2018Run Your Race\u2019 Podcast to talk about the Conference Finals:\n\u201cI think Game 2, we should\u2019ve won or that was the game we had the best chance of winning. It was Game 2. We felt like, obviously if we won that game, it would have shifted the momentum.

Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members!\nDownload the app\n.\nThe half marathon has become America\u2019s fastest-growing race distance over the years, with the number of 13.1-mile races booming along with the number of participants. In 2012, for example, 1.85 million people finished a 13.1-mile race, up nearly 15 percent from 2011, according to\nRunning USA\n. And it keeps growing, with a reported 2.1 million participants in 2018, according to the\nInternational Institute of Sports Medicine\n.\nWhy the half? For many runners, setting a 13.1-mile goal\u2014whether it\u2019s covering the distance for the first time or setting a new personal best\u2014is a reaching, yet still manageable challenge, offering nearly all the elation involved with finishing a marathon without the impact of going (and training for) twice the distance. Plus, you can bounce back quickly enough, so doing more than one or two a year isn\u2019t an unreasonable undertaking.\nThis year, whether you\u2019re running your\nfirst half marathon\nor your 15th, make the most of your 13.1-mile experience\u2014from sign-up to finish line\u2014with these top tips.\nRELATED:\n10 Things I Didn\u2019t Know About Training For A Half Marathon PR\n1. Run for a reason\nTraining for (and competing in) a long race can be an arduous endeavor, even if you already have a few of them under your belt. Regardless of whether you\u2019re a total newbie or a seasoned road warrior, ask yourself one simple question: \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d The answer to that question gives purpose to your chosen pursuit and will serve as your primary motivation throughout the training cycle as well as on race day.\nWe all have our own reasons for lacing up our running shoes, from trying something new and dropping a few pounds to running in memory of a loved one, raising money for a cause or setting a personal best. The list is endless. Whatever your reason or reasons for running, remind yourself of them regularly and never lose sight of what crossing that finish line means to you.\n2. Train for at least 13 weeks\nWhile it may seem a bit novel to allow yourself one week of training for every mile of the race, 13 weeks is long enough period of time to safely build up your long run, weekly mileage and key workouts, but not so long that you lose motivation and get stale with your training. For beginners whose longest run might only be 4 or 5 miles at the start, adding as little as a mile to your weekly long run will put you in a position to confidently cover the distance on race day. If you\u2019re an experienced runner and covering the distance isn\u2019t of concern, a 13-week training block chock full of gradually increasing mileage and challenging race-specific workouts can put you in a good position to go after a\nnew personal best\n. Once you\u2019re in shape to run a half, you can shorten your training program to about 10 weeks for your next one.\nRELATED:\nTime for a PR With Our Half Marathon Training Plan\n3. Find a shoe that works for you\nWith so many options out there, how do you know what the \u201cright\u201d half-marathon shoe is for you? Ask any running expert, and they\u2019ll tell you that the best running shoe for you is the one that you feel most comfortable in. It\u2019s really that simple.\nFeel like you need more help narrowing down to find the right pick? No worries. We\u2019ve got the\ncomplete guide\nto finding the perfect pair of shoes based on your running style, location, and experience.\n4. Then buy two\nThe miles will add up over the course of three months of half-marathon training, and one pair of shoes likely won\u2019t be enough to handle the entire load. Having two fresh pairs of shoes on hand when you start your training helps extend the life of each pair by giving them ample recovery time between workouts. Just as your body needs to recover after a long run or key workout, so do your kicks.\nIn fact, recent studies suggest that alternating between a couple different pairs of shoes in training can decrease running-related injury risk by varying the load to your musculoskeletal system. (One study found that alternating running shoes led to a 39 percent lower risk of running injury than running in the same shoes all the time.) Buying two pair of shoes can be an expensive outlay in cash, but the return on your investment can be extraordinary. Consider it an investment in your health and your ultimate race goals for the year.\n5. Recruit a half-marathon training partner\nDon\u2019t go at it alone \u2014 training is better with a buddy. A training partner can keep you excited and accountable when the miles rise, workouts get more challenging or if motivation starts to dip. They\u2019ll also be there to share every experience, celebrate with you on race day and swap epic stories afterward. It can be very tempting to stay in bed and skip a cold morning run if you\u2019re running by yourself, but knowing that you\u2019re meeting someone else to put in the work with you can be the catalyst that gets you up and out the door. If you\u2019re looking to improve your time, find a training partner who is quicker than you and let them push you to become a faster runner.\nRELATED:\nWant to Go Faster or Farther? Join a Running Group\n6. Plan a 5K and 10K too\nThree months out from your big race can seem like an eternity, so give yourself intermediate goals along the way to stay hungry and check your progress. Scheduling a 5K three to four weeks into training and a 10K three to four weeks before your half marathon will keep you motivated and provide a nice boost to your fitness while also serving as an indicator as to how well your training is coming along. These tune-up races also provide the opportunity to practice your race-day routine prior to your half marathon, which is perfect for newer runners, who can oftentimes be caught off guard by the chaotic, nerve-racking nature of a bigger event.\n7. Run on different surfaces\nDon\u2019t get caught in a running rut. It can be easy to head out the door and run the same route from your house every day or cave to the convenience of the treadmill at the gym\u2014yet again. As much as possible, try to switch up the surfaces you run on. Softer surfaces, such as grass or trails, can be great for recovery runs since the impact is less on your body, and the uneven nature of the surface can help strengthen your feet or lower legs. Running on roads can help harden your legs and work on your race rhythm, while the treadmill can help you dial in pace with laser-like precision. Much like switching up your running shoes, varying where you run can decrease the most common running-related overuse injuries.\n8. Get fast first\nIf you\u2019re an experienced half marathoner targeting a PR this year,\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1. Use only the information you've discovered to answer the question. Do not make up information.\n2. Pay special attention to the information such as time, location, and people involved.

However, following a disappointing performance, the US was the victim of a huge upset.\nAs expected, the semifinal match-up got off to a tight start. Neither team was able to take control throughout the opening two quarters with the US taking a slight 60-59 lead into halftime.\nHowever, the third quarter saw the tide change and Germany seized its opportunity, catching the US sleeping following the break.\nGermany outscored the US 35-24 in the third quarter and took a crucial 10-point lead into the final 10 minutes of the semifinal clash.\nLed by Anthony Edwards and Austin Reaves, Team USA rallied in the fourth and a final quarter comeback looked to be on, but it proved to be too little, too late.\nGermany held on resolutely, making key plays in the clutch, to book a spot in the FIBA Basketball World Cup final.\nThe loss represents another disappointing World Cup campaign for the US.\nDespite taking a team full of NBA stars including Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson, it marks the second consecutive World Cup where the US has failed to reach the championship game.\n\u201cTerrible. Plain and simple,\u201d Brunson told reporters of his performance against Germany.\n\u201cWe knew the task at hand, that was to go and win and we didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Reaves added following the defeat.\n\u201cThe game has been globalized over the last 30 years or so.

USA Basketball has been talking for years about how the continuity of top international teams has closed what was once a sizable gap between the Americans and the rest of the world.

However, based on the information I found, here's a humorous take:\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers, and Cincinnati Bengals are busy stretching, doing squats, and practicing touchdown dances because they are the top five favorites to win Super Bowl 58. But, keep an eye on the New York Jets too. They've got Aaron Rodgers, and it seems they're planning to hustle hard this year. \n\nBut remember, this is football, not a scripted movie.

[/INST] Aaron Rodgers is a renowned NFL quarterback, born on December 2, 1983, in Chico, California. He had a successful career with the Green Bay Packers, leading them to a Super Bowl XLV victory and winning four MVP awards. Here are some key points about him:\n\n- He played for the University of California at Berkeley during his college years, where he was a star player before being drafted by the Packers in 2005.\n- Rodgers got his chance to quarterback the team as a starter in Green Bay in 2008. He led the Packers to victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV and won MVP honors.\n- During his time with the Packers, Rodgers set numerous NFL passing records and continued to maintain his spot among football's top performers.\n- He won his third and fourth NFL MVP awards for the 2020 and 2021 seasons.\n- Despite his successful career with the Packers, there was speculation that Rodgers might retire or demand a trade out of Green Bay. Instead, the Packers signed him to a contract extension in March 2022 worth $150.8 million over three seasons.\n- In March 2023, Rodgers moved to the New York Jets. This move was viewed positively by many NFL analysts as it was expected to make the Jets a Super Bowl contender.\n- Unfortunately, in his season debut on September 11, 2023, Rodgers suffered a season-ending torn Achilles in his left leg. \n\nApart from his football career, Rodgers has also served as a guest host of the popular trivia game show 'Jeopardy!' for 10 episodes in April 2021, raising $236,725 for charity during his appearance.

These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.\nChanges observed in Earth\u2019s climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, raising Earth\u2019s average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity,\nchanges in the Sun\u2019s energy output\n,\nvariations in Earth\u2019s orbit\n).\nScientists use observations from the ground, air, and space, along with\ncomputer\nmodels\n, to monitor and study past, present, and future climate change. Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at Earth\u2019s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes.\n\u201cClimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms \"weather\" and \"climate\" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales.\nWhat Is Global Warming?\nThis graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures, with the year 2020 statistically tying with 2016 for hottest on record (Source:\nNASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies\n). Learn more about global surface temperature\nhere\n. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal warming is the long-term heating of Earth\u2019s surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the term \"climate change.\"\nSince the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth\u2019s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by more than 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. The current warming trend is unequivocally the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over millennia.\nWeather vs. Climate\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.\u201d\n- Mark Twain\nWeather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of time\u2014from minutes to hours or days.

But with such an abundance of options, here are some picks for venues with concerts that won\u2019t disappoint.\nEvanston Space\nIn south Evanston, Evanston SPACE offers a variety of live shows within walking distance of campus. An intimate venue for a few hundred audience members, one can find anything from folk to Elton John cover bands at SPACE. This fall, SPACE will welcome blues musician Stephen Hull (Sept. 25), Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Joan Osborne (Sept. 29) and Americana folk-rock band Briscoe (Oct. 13), among others.\nThalia Hall\nThalia Hall originated as a theater in the late 19th century before it found use in 2013 as a revitalized concert hall. Named the \u201cBest Music Venue\u201d this year by Chicago Reader, the venue makes the 45-minute drive down to Chicago\u2019s Pilsen area worth it. It welcomes up-and-coming and innovative musicians to its historic setting. This fall, you can catch pop artist Maude Latour (Oct. 8), folk-rock band Slaughter Beach, Dog (Nov. 5) or self-described \u201ctrippy-pop\u201d band Rawayana (Oct. 24). Artists perform at Thalia Hall almost every night, with most general admission tickets going for under $40.\nSchubas Tavern\nStraight down the Purple Line, Schubas Tavern boasts pop, hip-hop and folk performances. With room for over 160 audience members, the Lakeview venue provides an intimate atmosphere for its concerts. Singer-songwriter Aidan Bissett (Oct. 31), pop singer Hannah Jadagu (Oct. 1) and hip-hop artist Tom the Mail Man (Sept. 29) are a few of the artists you can hear this fall. For those looking to try their hand with the mic (and are over 21), Schubas will also host Open Mic Nights every Thursday from Sept. 28 through Oct. 26.\nReggie\u2019s\nNear Chinatown, Reggies compliments rock music with its bar and grill, the Reggies Music Joint, for an over-21 audience almost every night. It also holds concerts for those over 17 at its Rock Club. Events at the Music Joint, free with a seat in the restaurant, include acoustic shows, tailgates for Bears games and classic rock performances on the last Thursday of each month. The Rock Club holds regular concerts, with most tickets under $30. This fall, its performers include hip-hop artist Wynne (Oct. 1), rapper Tyla Yaweh (Nov. 2) and progressive-rock band H\u00e4llas (Nov. 10).\nKingston Mines\nIf you\u2019re over 21, check out Lincoln Park\u2019s Kingston Mines, Chicago\u2019s \u201clargest and oldest continuously operating blues club,\u201d according to its website. Founded in 1968, the venue offers pub food, drinks and live blues music Thursday through Saturday. With two performance spaces, performers like Joanna Connor, Nora Jean Wallace and Funky Mojo Daddy will grace the space soon. A quick trip down the Purple and Red Lines with a $15 to $20 cover at the door, Kingston Mines is a fun, easy way to catch some live music on the weekends.\n\u2014Late nights and top notch talent attract eclectic crowds from Chicago and beyond to historic Kingston Mines blues bar\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: 'Concerts happening in Chicago, Illinois on Monday: LDW SATURDAY DAYPARTY: Rooftop Patio & Afrobeats'\ndate: Sep 2, 2\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u2009Sep 25, 7\u202fPM CDT\ndescription: The biggest Afro social scene Labor Day WEEKEND NO WORK MONDAY About this Event ?

Now, they have 11 dogs and 10 cats left to adopt before the shelter begins to relocate.\nThe shelter's founder, Davis Cozy, passed away in 2022. Since then, Gibbs said she's done everything she can to keep the place going in his memory.\nAside from finding \"fur-ever\" homes for the puppies and kittens left in their litter, FOPAS is also fundraising for the shelter's new home.\n\"I have started FOPAS over \u2014 adoption center wise \u2014 so many times and, each time, something happens,\" Gibbs said. \"And then, we have to leave. And then, we've done things to the property to better house our animals. And then, we lose it. I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not getting a new owner. I've been doing this too many years.\"\nThe Friends of Perry Animal Shelter is holding fundraising events until the end of the year.

Search for bear continues\ndate: 2023-09-10\nbody: A search for a grizzly bear believed to have been shot in an attack on a deer hunter has shut down part of a Montana national forest, officials reported.\nA hunting party notified authorities of the attack on Yellow Mule Trail near Big Sky shortly before 2 p.m. Friday, Sept. 8, the Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Office search and rescue team said in a news release.\nA grizzly attacked a hunter who was stalking a deer, sheriff\u2019s officials said. The local sheriff\u2019s office requested help from Gallatin County.\nA helicopter airlifted the injured hunter to a Bozeman medical center, the release said. No information was provided on the hunter\u2019s medical condition, but the Billings Gazette reported the hunter was severely injured .\nThe Buck Ridge Yellow Mule area in the Custer Gallatin National Forest has been closed to visitors while officials try to track down the bear, rangers said in a news release.\nThe hunter shot at the grizzly and may have wounded the animal, rangers said.\n\u201cMontana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and Forest Service staff are investigating the incident and are trying to locate the bear,\u201d the release said.\nCall 406-522-2520 for more information on the closure.\nWhat to do if you see a bear\nBear attacks in the U.S. are rare, according to the National Park Service. In most attacks, bears are trying to defend their food, cubs or space.\nThere are steps people can take to help prevent a bear encounter from becoming a bear attack.\nIdentify yourself: Talk calmly and slowly wave your arms. This can help the bear realize you\u2019re a human and nonthreatening.\nStay calm: Bears usually don\u2019t want to attack; they want to be left alone. Talk slowly and with a low voice to the bear.\nDon\u2019t scream: Screaming could trigger an attack.\nPick up small children: Don\u2019t let kids run away from the bear. It could think they\u2019re small prey.\nHike in groups: A group is noisier and smellier, the National Park Service said. Bears like to keep their distance from groups of people.\nMake yourself look big: Move to higher ground and stand tall. Don\u2019t make any sudden movements.\nDon\u2019t drop your bag: A bag on your back can keep a bear from accessing food, and it can provide protection.\nWalk away slowly: Move sideways so you appear less threatening to the bear. This also lets you keep an eye out.\nAgain, don\u2019t run: Bears will chase you, just like a dog would.\nDon\u2019t climb trees:\n5. source quality: good\nMan attacked by grizzly bear in Big Sky remains in critical ...\nPlease ensure Javascript is enabled for purposes of\nwebsite accessibility\nMan attacked by grizzly bear in Big Sky remains in critical but stable condition | KECI\nWed, 13 Sep 2023 22:45:05 GMT (1694645105086)\nf21546d3a7b92848c6890935ca4e2b625f015352\n4a6d0bb8f30f1b6a167248fbd029e9fd6e7edbb4\nNews\nWeather\nSports\nGame Center\nChime In\nWatch\nNow\n52\nWed\n75\nThu\n78\nMan attacked by grizzly bear in Big Sky remains in critical but stable condition\nby\nBryanna Carroll\nTue, September 12th 2023, 2:54 AM UTC\nA man attacked by a grizzly bear just south of Big Sky in the Yellow Mule Area has been identified as Rudy Noorlander, according to a GoFundMe campaign organized by his daughter, Katelynn Noorlander.\nLoading ...\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Just like the rest of her body, she can control her tail muscles by thinking in order to manipulate movement. She can wag, lower or raise her tail at will, and she can stop it mid-wag, too. Some\nbreeds balance using their tails\n, so it\u2019s necessary to be able to control the muscles that control the tail.\nSocial Behavior\nPuppies don\u2019t wag their tails immediately after birth so many experts believe tail wagging is a socially learned behavior. The tail functions as an emotional barometer letting dogs communicate with their littermates, pack and other peers.\nHumans associate a wagging tail with a happiness\n; however, the angle and nature of the movement could also mean frustration, anger or agitation.\nStop and Go\nWhile dogs control the movement, they may not always start the wag. It appears they will start wagging out of instinct, not conscious thought, similar to when humans frown. Frowning might be ingrained as a response to a bad joke, but you can actively return your mouth to a smile.\nOther Movements\nIf you\u2019re not sure what your dog is communicating with her tail wag, look at the rest of the body to understand further. For example, if she is relaxed (ears loose, light panting), the wagging may indicate happiness. Conversely, when intimidated,\ndogs lower their tails\n. Each dog appears to have its own reactions and movements, so be sure to use all of the clues possible when trying to interpret your dog\u2019s emotions.\nWant to learn more about your pup?

(1/3) pic.twitter.com/OHGlyvjcAm\n\u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 5, 2023\nThe letter from law firms Davis Polk and Munger Tolles & Olson comes after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled last week that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF without adequately explaining its reasoning. The ruling requires the SEC to review Grayscale's application again, although the agency still has time to appeal.\n\"We believe the commission should conclude that there are no grounds for treating the trust differently from ETPs [exchange-traded products] that invest in Bitcoin futures contracts,\" the lawyers wrote, citing Bitcoin futures ETFs that the SEC has already approved.\nGrayscale has argued that its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF should be approved because it would rely on the same market surveillance arrangement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that the SEC has deemed sufficient for Bitcoin futures ETFs. The appeals court agreed, ruling that the SEC never explained why the two arrangements were materially different.\n\"If any other reason could be offered in attempting to differentiate spot Bitcoin ETPs from Bitcoin futures ETPs...we are confident that it would have surfaced by now,\" the lawyers stated.\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would give mainstream investors exposure to Bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency directly. The SEC has denied all spot bitcoin ETFs applications, often citing potential market manipulation concerns.\nGrayscale's Bitcoin Trust is currently the largest Bitcoin fund, with over $16 billion in assets. But its shares trade at a discount to the fund's Bitcoin hold\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Gensler Slams Crypto Markets as Lawmakers Raise Questions About Bitcoin ETF\ndate: 2023-09-12\nbody: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler today continued to slam the crypto industry during a Senate hearing with lawmakers, but refused to give any hints on where the regulator would go with the long list of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications that it\u2019s currently reviewing.\nReferring to a federal judge\u2019s bombshell decision last month to side with Grayscale over the SEC, Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Gensler what the body needs to see in a filing to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF.\nAD\nGensler told the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday that the SEC was \u201cstill reviewing that decision,\u201d and added: \u201cWe have multiple filings around Bitcoin exchange-traded products, so it\u2019s not just that one you mentioned, but it\u2019s multiple others who we\u2019re reviewing. I\u2019m looking forward to the staff's recommendations.\u201d\nLast month, a judge ruled that the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application must be reviewed, siding with Grayscale in its lawsuit against the regulator.\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is the hottest topic in the crypto world right now; the SEC has for years denied applications for the product, which would allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset.\nBut investors are hungry for a product\u2014including institutions\u2014because it would give them direct exposure to the crypto world in a safer and easier way.\nToday, asset manager Franklin Templeton became the latest Wall Street giant to enter the Bitcoin ETF race by filing an SEC application for a \u201cFranklin Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\nOther big names hoping to get their product approved include BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, and Boston-based investment giant Fidelity.\nGensler today reiterated that he thought the industry was a Wild West of noncompliance. \u201cIt\u2019s a field which is rife with fraud, abuse, and misconduct,\u201d he told lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers have criticized Gensler for not being clear-cut enough with what he wants from crypto companies, and in turn stifling innovation.\nUnder his watch, the top regulator has cracked down hard on the digital asset industry, hitting major crypto brands like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and others with lawsuits.\n3. source quality: unknown\ntitle: Bitcoin ETF race back on as Franklin Templeton steps up to the plate\ndate: 2023-09-13\nbody: Bitcoin ETF race back on as Franklin Templeton steps up to the plate\nFranklin Templeton, the long-running US investment firm with over a trillion dollars under management, has joined the race to become the first traditional finance institution with a spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on offer.\nThe firm filed its intentions with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), naming Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) as crypto custodian and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) as cash custodian.\nFranklin Templeton thus joins GrayScale, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest, WisdomTree and numerous other major financial institutions in pressuring the US securities regulator into approving spot-bitcoin ETFs.\nAn investment vehicle of this kind would give retail and institutional investors access to bitcoin on the traditional stock exchange, potentially opening the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency up to trillions of dollars of untapped wealth.\nHowever, the SEC has snubbed any and all applications since 201, when the Winklevoss Twins\u2019 Gemini crypto exchange became the first to apply for a spot-bitcoin ETF.\nA maiden approval has become a holy grail of sorts for the cryptocurrency sector, and though the SEC has shown animosity to the idea on the ground that the bitcoin markets are prone to fraud and manipulation, a recent court win for Grayscale has pushed the dial closer to victory.\nBitcoin sent higher\nBitcoin bounced higher on news of Franklin Templeton\u2019s application, hitting highs of $28,570 on Tuesday. BTC/USDT saw a bit of a correction after this peak, though still managed to close the session 2.7% higher at $25,840.\nThe pair added another 0.5% in this morning\u2019s Asia trades, bringing bitcoin up to $25,979 at the time of writing.\nBTC/USDT is 3.7% higher over six months \u2013 Source: tradingview.com\nThe short but unexpected rally caught the puts off guard, causing nearly $38 million in short liquidations on the futures market against $15 million in long liquidations.\nEthereum (ETH) enjoyed a boost on Tuesday, closing \n4. source quality: good\nGrayscale Prods SEC to Approve Bitcoin Spot ETF After ...\nGrayscale Prods SEC to Approve Bitcoin Spot ETF After Court Victory - Decrypt\nGrayscale Prods SEC to Approve Bitcoin Spot ETF After Court Victory\nCoin Prices\nBitcoin\n$26,227.00\n1.26%\nEthereum\n$1,617.60\n1.89%\nBNB\n$211.70\n0.91%\nXRP\n$0.483657\n0.98%\nCardano\n$0.247301\n1.18%\nDogecoin\n$0.06125\n0.96%\nSolana\n$18.75\n5.36%\nTRON\n$0.081151\n0.82%\nPolkadot\n$3.99\n0.61%\nPolygon\n$0.516447\n1.26%\nLitecoin\n$62.34\n4.17%\nShiba Inu\n$0.00000726\n1.10%\nWrapped Bitcoin\n$26,217.00\n1.36%\nBitcoin Cash\n$200.37\n1.70%\nLEO Token\n$3.65\n-0.52%\nAvalanche\n$9.32\n1.49%\nStellar\n$0.119263\n-0.76%\nChainlink\n$6.03\n1.25%\nUniswap\n$4.27\n1.76%\nMonero\n$143.68\n0.66%\nOKB\n$42.26\n1.68%\nEthereum Classic\n$15.06\n0.76%\nCosmos Hub\n$6.53\n2.05%\nFilecoin\n$3.17\n1.90%\nCronos\n$0.050569\n0.78%\nLido DAO\n$1.49\n1.87%\nInternet Computer\n$2.93\n-0.21%\nAptos\n$5.19\n2.06%\nVeChain\n$0.01627751\n1.76%\n\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Her lawsuit is backed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana.\nZephyr's calls to vote against a gender-affirming care ban for transgender youth on bill SB99 led to her being ignored for days by Republican leaders on the House floor in April.\nSome legislators, including Regier, argued she had broken House rules of decorum when she said legislators would have \"blood on your hands\" if they passed the transgender youth care ban.\nDemonstrators in support of the transgender lawmaker interrupted House business several days later to protest Zephyr being silenced.

It also took place as conservative lawmakers nationwide have introduced a flurry of anti-LGBTQ+ bills this year.\nArticle continues below this ad\nOne of the defendants, Paul Kim of Missoula, said his attorney told him the county decided to drop the charges. Phone messages seeking comment Tuesday from County Attorney Kevin Downs and Deputy County Attorney Deanna Rothwell were not returned.\nThe plaintiffs were arrested on April 24 after a group of people disrupted the floor session for about 30 minutes when the Republican majority denied Zephyr, a Democratic representative from Missoula, the opportunity to speak on a bill that would require parental consent for children to change the names and pronouns they use at school.\nZephyr defiantly hoisted her microphone into the air as her supporters chanted \u201cLet her speak!\u201d\nZephyr had been silenced for telling fellow lawmakers that if they supported a bill to ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth they would have blood on their hands.

The Montana Speaker of the House also described how law enforcement had intel warning of the attack.\nAt least seven protestors were arrested after a mob of radical Left-wing activists were pounding on the doors of the House Chamber of the Montana State Capitol and disrupting the Democratic process. The staged event is similar to \"transurrections\" of unruly transgender activists that have targeted lawmakers in other statehouses across the country.\nAs KTVH-TV reports, seven were arrested following Monday's antics in Helena.\nLewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton told MTN seven people were arrested for criminal trespass after refusing to leave the gallery.\nKTVH added that the Montana Highway Patrol, the Helena Police Department and the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office Civil Disobedience Team all responded to the capitol.\nCheck out the full thread via Greg Price below featuring video, photos, and more.\nThe mob was demanding that the Montana House of Representatives \"let her speak,\" referring to transgender lawmaker Rep.

A procession of freshmen, transfer and international students passed through the Weber Arch , the university\u2019s iconic entryway at Sheridan Road and Chicago Avenue in Evanston, signifying the start of their university experience.\nMost Northwestern freshmen and transfer students began moving into residence halls on Monday. Returning students are expected to join them Saturday, before classes start next week. The mood on campus was jubilant Tuesday as incoming students waved purple and white pompoms while their family members \u2014 some teary-eyed \u2014 looked on and shot photos.\nYet the Northwestern University Class of 2027 has arrived in the wake of great turmoil within the university\u2019s athletics department, starting with allegations of rampant hazing of players on the football team and then spiraling into numerous claims of abusive behavior and toxic cultures pervading multiple sports teams.\nThe prestigious university now faces a litany of lawsuits stemming from the complaints of former college athletes as well as a lawsuit filed by several former baseball team staffers . In response, Northwestern is having former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch conduct a review of the university and its athletics department. In a Tribune opinion piece, University President Michael Schill last month apologized \u201con behalf of the university to those athletes and all others affected\u201d and has pledged that hazing will not be tolerated at Northwestern.\n\u201cObviously the scandals are what they are,\u201d Holliday said, as the last few incoming students filed through the Arch. \u201cThat is absolutely something we want to make sure is solved and no other kid has to endure any of the alleged circumstances.\u201d\nYet he hopes the spotlight on hazing and its consequences might prove to be a turning point, spurring Northwestern \u2014 and perhaps other colleges and universities as well \u2014 to become better communities and safer havens for students in the long run.\n\u201cWe trust them. We\u2019re giving our kids to them,\u201d said Holliday, who like so many family members wore a purple Northwestern shirt for the start-of-the-academic-year festivities. \u201cSo we hope that not only Northwestern, after this is all settled, will be a better place and safer place for our kids, but that all institutions across the country will do the same.\u201d\nAfter March Through the Arch concluded, the incoming students and their loved ones gathered at Deering Meadow, a 2-acre green space outside the university library that was once the site of the first Northwestern football field.\nPresident Schill addressed the crowd, noting that the day marked one year since he took office.\n\u201cWelcome to your new home,\u201d he said, as the crowd cheered. \u201cYou are all Wildcats now. You now belong fully to a global family of Northwestern people who care for one another and bring out the very, very best in each other.\u201d\nThe message was in stark contrast to the claims of many former Northwestern athletes \u2014 representing an array of sports including volleyball, lacrosse, softball, baseball and football \u2014 who have recently filed lawsuits against the university.\n\u201cI was conditioned to think this stuff is normal, and this was what goes on in college football, this is\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Head Coach Dismissed in Wake of Northwestern University's Hazing Scandal\ndate: 2023-09-05\nbody: video by @NBCChicago\nNorthwestern University has let go of its long-standing head football coach amid claims of widespread hazing and racism. Both the football and baseball coaching staff were implicated in the accusations, resulting in a thorough, six-month investigation initiated by the university. Several former athletes relayed instances of troubling experiences, provoking them to press charges against the school.\nConsequently, the university insisted that the football team participate in comprehensive anti-hazing training, led by consulting firm Protection All. The university's Athletic Director, Derrick Gragg, has commended the team's courage during this stressful period. Gragg emphasized that the players' behaviors should uphold the honor of themselves, their families, and the university in the future.\nThe reaction from the university, however, has not entirely neutralized the situation. Several alumni associations are scrutinizing the correlation between the university's actions and Northwestern\u2019s overall athletics culture. However, Gragg reassured the community, declaring that a thoughtful strategy is in place to progress and there are no plans for additional personnel changes.\nMore details:\n[1] Northwestern AD: Teams Took Misconduct Training 'Very Seriously' After Hazing Scandal\n[2] Northwestern AD Derrick Gragg lauds football team's 'resilience' in wake of hazing scandal\nThe post includes content assisted by AI tools.

Several former student athletes have now filed lawsuits against the university, while Fitzgerald himself has retained prominent legal counsel and could seek legal recourse following his termination.\nThe following is a timeline of events detailing the investigation, Fitzgerald\u2019s termination and subsequent lawsuits:\nNov. 30, 2022\n: University officials\nreceived an anonymous complaint\nalleging there had been hazing occurring within the NU football program. That complaint claimed the hazing involved student athletes and may have begun during the team\u2019s training camp activities in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\nDec. 2022\n: Northwestern hired attorney Maggie Hickey, of the law firm ArentFox Schiff, to conduct an investigation into the hazing allegation.\nJuly 7\n: After Hickey\u2019s investigation is complete, Northwestern University President Michael Schill announced Fitzgerald has been suspended for two weeks without pay. While that investigation did not find sufficient evidence that the coaching staff knew about ongoing hazing, Hickey did find that there were \u201csignificant opportunities\u201d to find out about and report the conduct.\nThe university also announced additional steps in response to Hickey\u2019s report, including: ending the football team\u2019s Kenosha training camp, requiring an outside monitor in the team\u2019s locker room who doesn\u2019t report to the football coaching staff, and creating an online portal for student athletes to anonymously report hazing or hazing-related concerns.\nJuly 8\n:\nThe Daily Northwestern\n, the university\u2019s student newspaper, published details from a former football player who described the hazing he\u2019d seen as \u201cegregious and vile and inhumane behavior.\u201d The player said some of that hazing involved coerced sexual acts \u2014 allegations that a second player also told the paper \u2014 and that Fitzgerald may have known that hazing took place.\nAccording to The Daily, the player described a hazing activity he referred to as \u201crunning,\u201d which was used to punish players for mistakes made during games or practice. When this occurred, the selected player would be restrained by several upperclassmen wearing \u201cPurge-\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Here are the main points based on the information I found:\n\n- The French government announced the ban on abayas last month. Abaya is a long, loose-fitting dress often worn by Muslim women [1,4].\n- On the first day of the new academic year, nearly 300 students arrived at school wearing abayas. Those who refused to remove them were sent home [1,2,3].\n- This move is seen as part of the rules on secularism in education in France. In fact, head coverings, including the hijab, were first banned in French public schools back in 2004 [1,3].\n- The ban is currently being challenged by a rights group, Action Droits Des Musulmans (ADM). Their main argument is that the abaya has not been formally classified as a religious item and the ban infringes on \"fundamental rights,\" such as the right to personal liberty [2].\n- France's administrative law requires a decision on the appeal to be handed down by the State Council within 48 hours of the hearing [2]. \n\nPlease note that while the ban is implemented, the appeal process against it is ongoing. </s><s> \n\n[INST] You are a helpful QA robot.\nToday is 09-27-2023.\nGiven a question from a  user: Update on the appeal decision?\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\n1. source quality: good\ntitle: French schools turn away girls wearing abayas as Muslim rights group challenges ban\ndate: 2023-09-06\nbody: Public schools in France have been turning away students for breaking a new national ban on the abaya , a long, robe-like garment often worn by Muslim women, as a rights group filed an appeal against the prohibition.\nA total of 67 girls returned home rather than remove their abayas, Education Minister Gabriel Attal told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday.\nAcross the country a total of 298 pupils arrived at school wearing abayas, but a \u201clarge majority\u201d agreed to remove them, said Attal, who added that the new rule had been followed \u201cwithout any major difficulty to report\u201d as the country\u2019s schools began the new academic year on Monday.\nAttal announced the ban on abayas in schools on Sunday, but by Tuesday the State Council, France\u2019s highest court for complaints against state authorities, had heard an appeal from the Action Droits Des Musulmans (ADM) group.\nThe group\u2019s lawyer, Vincent Brengarth, told journalists before the hearing that the ban is \u201cnot based on any legal text.\u201d\nIn a separate interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday evening, Brengarth said the ban has been imposed in an \u201carbitrary\u201d manner as it contains no legal definition of what an abaya looks like.

Ross, right, face charges in Arizona after allegedly threatening Burger King employees to fight. (Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\nA couple faces criminal charges after allegedly trashing a Burger King in Arizona and challenging employees to a fight over her wait time in the drive-thru and the number of chicken nuggets in a value pack.\nIt happened Saturday afternoon at the eatery on John Wayne Parkway in the city of Maricopa. The incident started when Sheree Nichelle Ross, 44, became impatient at how long it was taking to get her food and threw a cup through the drive-thru, a probable cause affidavit obtained by Law&Crime shows. Related Coverage:\nWhen a worker threw the cup back to her, Ross pulled the car over and went into the store, accompanied by her husband Tavarus Ross, 43, and another woman who has not been identified, police said.\nThe trio proceeded to allegedly throw displays and challenge employees to fight.\n\u201cTavarus reportedly told an employee to have his manager clock out so he could fight her,\u201d the affidavit states. Ross also told an employee to \u201ccome out from behind the counter to fight her,\u201d the document said.\nTavarus Ross also allegedly threw a glass cookie display at one of the employees, who deflected it with his hand before it shattered on the floor, the affidavit said.\nBurger King staff called the police to report the attack.\nWhen police arrived, the three had already fled. Displays were on the floor and staff was cleaning up spilled liquid around the counter, the affidavit said. An employee who reported the incident told police about what allegedly set off Sheree Ross.\nPolice caught Sheree Ross after an employee gave police her license plate number.\nAfter being pulled over, the suspect allegedly told police she knew she was in the wrong and was \u201cjust heated in the moment.\u201d\nShe also identified her husband, who was arrested at his job \u2014 at another fast-food restaurant, the affidavit said.\nTavarus Ross allegedly told investigators he only pushed the cookie display off the counter but did not throw it. He also said he was upset because his wife told him Burger King employees threw soda on his child.\nHe allegedly said he tried to call the police and listed some phone numbers that he had dialed, but Maricopa dispatchers received no call from him, the affidavit said.\nSheree and Tavarus Ross were booked into the Pinal County Jail. They face charges of causing damage and a disturbance. She was released on her own recognizance. He posted $1,000 bond and was released, according to the Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nIt was unclear whether they have attorneys.

But he said the coupons came off and I said, \u2018No, the coupons are not off.\u2019\u201d\nJohnson said the cashier grabbed his calculator. She said she also added up the groceries again.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018What the F do you want my job?\u2019 And I was in a state of shock,\u201d Johnson said.\nHowever, Johnson said the employee did not stop there.\n\u201cThe stuff was on the conveyor belt, and he got the chips, and he took both of his fists and slammed them so hard that the chips went everywhere,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe then grabbed the bag, and he was shaking the bag with chips going all over me. He then threw them from the register across the floor.\u201d\nOther employees ended up sweeping up the mess. But Johnson said she feared for her life during the incident.\n\u201cI saw the chicken wings and I picked them up and I threw them and hit him. He looked at me and got to screaming,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe shopper said the employee in question had to be restrained.\nPolice described the male worker as being in his 40s. They have not yet charged the employee, but a report indicated a charge is pending for disorderly conduct.\nKroger representatives said they are aware of the customer\u2019s concern and are currently reviewing the situation.\nCopyright 2023 WTVG via Gray Media Group, Inc.

With two locations in Heath and Newark on the outskirts of Columbus, the brand is expanding with as many as six new units by the end of 2023.\n\u201cPlaza Pizza has been a staple in these communities for more than 50 years and has some fiercely loyal customers,\u201d says co-owner Brian Claggett. He added that he grew up eating Plaza Pizza and was stationed in the military in Korea when his mother called to let him know Plaza was for sale. After doing some research and due diligence, Claggett and his two siblings, Ben and Olivia, bought Plaza\u2019s Newark location in 2019. He said the establishment has changed tremendously since it first opened in the seventies.\n\u201cIt was a beloved, old school mom and pop business that only accepted cash or checks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it withstood the test of time because customers loved the quality and the authentic flavors and ingredients.\u201d\nClaggett has not tinkered with the original menu very much and is still serving up popular pizzas such as All the Meats, which includes pepperoni, bacon, ham, sausage, and hamburger, and All the Way, which has pepperoni, mushroom, onion, green pepper, green olives, and banana peppers. A Cauliflower Crust is preferred by customers following keto or low carb diets, while toasted subs called Torpedoes are piled high with toppings. Unlike some pizza chains that rely on frozen crusts and toppings, Claggett says Plaza\u2019s dough and sauce is made in-house every day and produce is noticeably fresh from supporting local farmers. Claggett added that Plaza\u2019s success with two locations in the Columbus area is an indicator the brand will do well in other parts of the country.\n\u201cColumbus is a melting pot of diverse palates and preferences due in part to the influence of Ohio State,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with numerous industry experts who confirm that if a food concept can be successful in Columbus, it can be successful throughout America.\u201d\nPlaza Pizza is actively seeking entrepreneurs and investors to become franchise partners. Startup costs are attractive compared to similar options, as Plaza is a pickup franchise without the burgeoning overheads of dine-in restaurants There is a franchise fee of $45,000 with a special military discount extended to veterans. Claggett says franchisees will benefit from the knowledge, support, and resources of the corporate team, and will learn everything they need to know about running a successful business.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible profits from our locations, so we have the playbook on how to succeed,\u201d he says. \u201cIn addition to our efficient operations, I believe we\u2019ve been successful because we are focused on doing one thing well \u2013 and that\u2019s thin crust pizza. We are not trying to become a jack-of-all trades, and would rather be known as the premier thin crust brand in America.\u201d\n3. source quality: poor\ntitle: Domino's Pizza\nrating: 4\ncategory:\n- Pizza delivery\n- Chicken wings restaurant\n- Pizza restaurant\n- Pizza Takeout\nabout: Delivery/carryout chain offering a wide range of pizzas & a variety of other dishes & sides.\naddress: 1226 N 21st St, Newark, OH 43055\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Friday 10:30\u202fAM\u20131:30\u202fAM\n- Saturday 10:30\u202fAM\u20131:30\u202fAM\n- Sunday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Monday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Tuesday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Wednesday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n\n4. source quality: poor\ntitle: Christy\u2019s Pizza\nrating: 4.3\ncategory:\n- Pizza restaurant\n- Delivery Restaurant\nabout: Veteran pizza parlor providing various pies, subs & salads in a spacious, laid-back setting.\naddress: 15 E Church St, Newark, OH 43055\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n- Friday 11\u202fAM\u201311\u202fPM\n- Saturday 5\u201311\u202fPM\n- Sunday Closed\n- Monday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n- Tuesday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n- Wednesday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n\n5. source quality: poor\ntitle: flaming grill Newark, NJ 07191: Wawa\nname: Wawa\nnum_reviews: '65'\nrating: '3.4'\ncategories:\n- Gas Stations\n- Convenience Stores\n- Fast Food\ntop_categories:\n- Automotive\n- Restaurants\n- Food\nprice_level: 1\nfull_address: 200 Harrison Ave Kearny, NJ\namenities:\n- Offers Delivery\n- Offers Takeout\n- Accepts Credit Cards\n- Private Lot Parking\n- Free Wi-Fi\n- Offers Delivery\n- Offers Takeout\n- Accepts Credit Cards\n- Private Lot Parking\n- Free Wi-Fi\nzipcode: '07032'\nestablish_year: '1803'\nhours:\n  Mon: Open 24 hours\n  Tue: Open 24 hours\n  Wed: Open 24 hours\n  Thu: Open 24 hours\n  Fri: Open 24 hours\n  Sat: Open 24 hours\n  Sun: Open 24 hours\ntelephone: (201) 991-4091\nhistory: Wawa, founded in 1803, is headquartered in Wawa, Pennsylvania.

If you consider yourself to be true and tried carnivore, you'll love the endless array of quality cuts that Japanese BBQ and steakhouses offer. While some establishments allow you to have a more interactive yakiniku experience while you grill your own meats, more high-end Japanese steakhouses prepare everything for you, and sometimes, in front of you.\nWhether you're visiting or a local, Los Angeles is home to several different kinds of Japanese steakhouses including fine-dining, Michelin-starred options along with more casual, chain restaurants. From A5 wagyu to tender filet mignon, many of these steakhouses serve the best of the best when it comes to beef. While you'll definitely need to make a reservation for the more upscale spots, many of these classic and casual joints can be dined at on a whim. That said, get ready to grill because we've ranked the 15 best Japanese steakhouses in LA!\n15. Gyu-Kaku\nIf you're new to Japanese BBQ, Gyu-Kaku is a solid place to start. You definitely won't get the highest-quality cuts, but the experience is fun, consistent, flavorful, and filling. There are locations all throughout Los Angeles stretching from Santa Monica to Pasadena with several in between. Availability varies between locations, but most Gyu-Kaku's offer an all-you-can-eat option for those that are extra hungry.\nThat said, the a la carte menu is most popular for patrons looking to choose all of their own meats and appetizers. Start off with the light and spicy cucumber salad before digging into the hearty selection of meats. When it's time to get grilling, explore different cuts like the popular prime Kalbi short rib or beef tongue. If you visit during happy hour, meats like the filet mignon and premium sirloin can be ordered at a discounted price. Gyu-Kaku also has a few poultry and pork options to choose from as well.\n14. Habachiana Grill\nLooking to enjoy some teriyaki steak on the go? Located in downtown Los Angeles, Habachiana Grill is a fast-casual spot that is ideal for takeout. From rice bowls to combo plates, the food is simple yet tasty. All Habachihana entrees and combo plates are served with grilled veggies and steamed rice, but you can always upgrade to fried rice (and it's well worth it).

The Brazilian dog groomer banks $1.3 million a year providing canines with impeccable coifs in California. But what you may not know is that Feitosa is lending his services, free of charge, to shelter pups looking for forever homes. In a new collab with the San Diego Humane Society, Feitosa is beautifying fur babies eligible for adoption.\nDog grooming star helps shelter dogs\nAccording to KPBS , Feitosa has teamed up with the San Diego Humane Society to offer grooming for its tough-to-place pooches. The shelter is overrun with more dogs than they can care for. Currently, they house more than 1,100 dogs across multiple campuses. That puts them at 170% of capacity.\nSo, last December, Feitosa contacted the organization to see how he could help the dogs they serve.\n\u201cI was trying to find a way to give back,\u201d Feitosa told KPBS. \u201cSo I reached out to the Humane Society and said, \u2018Hey guys, what if we transform your guys\u2019s dogs and bring attention not only for the dogs who are (not) getting to get adopted right away, but to the cause?'\u201d\nIt was an offer the humane society couldn\u2019t refuse.\nMore than a makeover\nFeitosa focuses on dogs that often get overlooked, like senior dogs and large-breed dogs . Among his clients on a recent trip to the humane society\u2019s El Cajon campus was a three-legged dog named Minnow. Feitosa turned the tiny canine into a tiger with strategically-placed dye (which was vegan and non-toxic).\nA much bigger dog named Nyla also got a makeover. The fluffy white pup received rainbow hues on her ears and tail.\nAfter the dogs get dyed, they receive a bath, blow dry, and a trim. Then they\u2019re ready for their close-up \u2013 on Feitosa\u2019s wildly popular TikTok and Instagram channels.\nAs if these random acts of kindness weren\u2019t enough, Feitosa also pays for the adoption fees and any other costs his special clients incur at the shelter.\n\u201cIt fills me with joy, especially because we focus on transforming the dogs that actually need more attention,\u201d he told KPBS. \u201cWhen I hear that those guys get adopted, I\u2019m just like over the moon. I\u2019m just grateful that I get to do it.\u201d\nThe post Dog Grooming Star Donates Services to San Diego Humane Society appeared first on DogTime .\n2. source quality: google\nHighlighted Answer from Google: PetSmart\nSan Diego (Sports Arena) - PetSmart\n\n3. source quality: poor\ntitle: pet smart grooming Sports Arena Blvd, San Diego, CA 92110: PetSmart\nname: PetSmart\nnum_reviews: 176\nrating: 3.5\ncategories:\n- Pet Stores\n- Pet Training\n- Pet Groomers\ntop_categories:\n- Pets\nfull_address: 3610 Rosecrans St San Diego, CA\nzipcode: '92110'\nestablish_year: '1987'\nhours:\n  Mon: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Tue: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Wed: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Thu: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Fri: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Sat: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Sun: 10:00 AM - 7:00 PM\ntelephone: (619) 523-4177\nhistory: We have more than 1,600 pet stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, over 200 in-store PetSmart's PetsHotels, dog and cat boarding facilities, and employ approximately 55,000 associates across our company.

It can be hard to find a minute of peace \u2013 from white noise of the \u201cL\u201d train to the eerie whistling of harsh wind through tiny gaps in the windows. From the paralyzingly cold winters to the drenchingly humid summers, it\u2019s rare to find a climate that allows for moments of pure appreciation for the city. While sometimes overwhelming, Chicago is nonetheless a city full of rich history and artistic passion. Even in the cruelest of Chicago days, there is beauty to be found in the mere details of the architecture and the remnants of historic artistic expression. The surviving bookstores of Chicago stand as examples of this phenomenon. The necessity of physical bookstores dwindles, but the persistence of the certain stores still standing is proof of the community\u2019s appreciation for tangible literature.\nFor the book lover new to Chicago, you may be pleased to hear that there is a thriving community of bookstores and booksellers in the city, and it won\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon.\nIn efforts to keep the community alive, the organization Chicago Loves Books challenges book lovers to an annual bookstore crawl in honor of Independent Bookstore Day. This past April, the third annual crawl ranged across \u201cmore than 40 independent bookstores in the greater Chicago area\u2014from Lake Forest to Beverly, and Naperville to the Loop.\u201d\nI discovered this challenge during a visit to the independent bookstore closest to my apartment: Sandmeyer\u2019s Bookstore. I was thrilled to find out that bookstores still had the potential to stir up so much hype through an event like this.\nFor anyone like myself who is interested in participating in the book crawl but find themselves limited to transportation via the \u201cL,\u201d here are my favorites. These essential stops for bookstore connoisseurs are all located less than a ten minute walk from Red or Blue Line stations. While all beautiful, they each have unique personalities that are appreciated best by different types of visitors.\nSandmeyer\u2019s Bookstore: For the old timey-loving reader\nThe first time I stepped foot into this bookstore, my senses were flooded by the smell of hardwood and sound of the creaky floors I walked on. Stepping in from the harsh Chicago weather, the space feels untouched not only by the weather outside but by time itself. The ambience is createdbrought by nothing more than the noticeable age of the building, untouched by any sort of remodel, only restoration.\nRight off of the Harrison Red Line stop, this store is located in the heart of Printer\u2019s Row in the South Loop, a place oozing with history that is especially relevant to the creation of books themselves. This site was once the epicenter for printing and bookbinding in the midwest as of the late 19th-century. Despite the store\u2019s time capsule-like aesthetic, their selection is constantly up-to-date on new releases and best sellers. They have a wide variety of well-organized genres, offering something for everyone.\nQuimby\u2019s Bookstore: For the graphic novel and zine lover\nI first found myself in Quimby\u2019s Bookstore on the day of last year\u2019s crawl. In true Chicago fashion, I stumbled in from a flash April shower to the comfort of a roof over my head and the warm embrace of a bookstore. Opposing the concept of a traditional bookstore, Quimby\u2019s embraces an angsty vibe through its obsc\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Will my students' parents put the blame on me for poor grades? Will they question my instructional methods? Will anyone even show up?\nIn the 22 years I've been teaching, I've seen just about everything. I've had a parent ask me\nwhy I teach\nMacbeth\nwhen everyone knows Shakespeare is boring and antiquated. I've had to explain to a parent that her child was on her phone way too much in class while the parent obsessively texted on her own phone during our entire conversation. I've had parents tell me I shouldn't care about plagiarism\u2014I should just be happy their child found the information at all.\nDespite these occasional moments of friction, teachers should do their utmost to see parents as essential partners in their students' education. After all, have you ever met any parents who didn't want their child to succeed? Parents can be valuable allies in helping students achieve their best, and meetings are a great way to forge those bonds. Here are eight tips to help you conduct masterful, action-oriented parent-teacher meetings.\nBe Proactive\nDon't forget to factor in some students' ninja-like ability to ensure their parents don't know conference times and dates; the same student who may have trouble on his math exams may be secretly adept at hacking into his dad's smartphone and deleting a voicemail. Repeated communication is occasionally necessary.\nSometimes, it can be difficult to even get parents into the building: work runs late, coordinating childcare is a headache, and language barriers may hinder communication. You can overcome some of these obstacles by finding culturally appropriate ways to welcome families and encourage them to become active participants in your classroom. Send invitations in a parent's native language, or have translators on hand. At my school, designated students handle basic translation of nonconfidential conversations, while school translators handle more delicate issues. If childcare is a problem, let parents know they can bring young ones to the meeting.\nBe Welcoming\nSet the right tone for your parent-teacher meeting by shaking hands, stating your name and the subject you teach, and mentioning how happy you are to be teaching their child. Smile warmly, and offer them a seat. If you're looking for an easy way to break the ice, share a positive anecdote about their child. For example, \"Did Jeremiah tell you he was the first one to solve the difficult math problem yesterday?\"\nExplain Objectives and Expectations\nI like to give parents an overview of the goals for my classes and a copy of our reading list. I discuss the expectations I have for my students and explain any language that a parent might not be familiar with: rubric, scaffolding, readiness, testing acronyms, etc. In addition, I provide parents with a copy of my classroom policies to review and sign, which helps avoid any confusion in the future.\nBe Prepared\nParents want to see that the teacher knows their child and has a plan for their success. Review your students' grades and portfolios before the conferences. Jot down notes about each student, anticipate questions or parental concerns, and reread any prior parent communication so you don't miss a beat.\nCreate an Action Plan\nParents don't want a laundry list of concerns dumped in their laps\u2014they want to know how you're going to fix the problem. Create an action plan that clearly lays out the specific steps that the teacher, the parent, and the student will need to take in order for the student to be successful. For instance, if Gabriela doesn't complete essays because she has a difficult time writing introductions, her written action plan should include an agreement that she'll notify you when she needs help, that you'll meet with her to provide assistance, and that her parents will make sure that she spends time at home crafting her essay.\nUse the Good-Bad-Good Sandwich\nWhen it comes to discussing tough topics with a parent, this trick is the silver bullet. Start by highlighting something positive\u2014\"Gerald's writing shows an insight I don't often see in students his age\"\u2014then move on to the issue: \"The problem is that Gerald is often off-task, and I've caught him on his phone several times. When he's not paying attention, he misses valuable class content.\" Discuss your action plan for correcting the behavior, and finish up with another positive statement: \"With Gerald's strong writing ability and his improved attention in class, I know he'll have a successful year.\" The good-bad-good sandwich is practically foolproof.\nDon't Tolerate Abuse\nI've had parents threaten to call the superintendent, the mayor, the pope (OK, maybe not the pope, but you get the idea). If a parent becomes abusive, simply end the meeting; explain how they can take up the matter with the principal. There's no reason you have to let a parent bully or intimidate you.\nKeep Lines of Communication Open\nExplain to parents how they can get in touch with you after the meeting, and ask the best way to reach them. Encourage them to ask questions, provide updates, and express concerns as they see fit.\nBumps in the road happen, but 98 percent of my parent-teacher meetings over the years have been meaningful and effective. Some of my students' parents have even become strong advocates for my classroom. And many have truly gone the extra mile for teachers.\nFor instance, for three years while her child was in my class, one parent made sure to bring me a home-cooked Italian dinner before every single parent-teacher conference. By graduation, I felt like I needed to give that parent my Social Security number so she could put me down as a dependent on her income tax\u2014boy, I sure miss all that pasta e fagioli and lasagna.\nParents and teachers are on the same team when it comes to helping students achieve. Following these steps can help you create partnerships with parents and ensure that all your students are equipped to succeed.\nSHARE\nFOLLOW\nBeyond the\nclassroom\nProfessional\ndevelopment\nTeaching\nmoments\nClassroom\ninnovation\nRecommended\nHow to Build Trust with Students\nLearn more \u203a\nEngaging Students during the Long Winter Months\nLearn more \u203a\n5 REALISTIC Ways for Teachers to Get Healthier This Year\nLearn more \u203a\nRelated\nNancy Barile\nAward-Winning Teacher\nM.A.Ed.\nNancy Barile is a National Board Certified Teacher, who has been teaching English Language Arts at a low-income, urban high school near Boston, MA for 22 years.
