Decoding The Key Race Metric\nbody: In the high-speed world of Formula 1 racing, every fraction of a second counts. One important concept used to measure the performance of drivers and teams is delta time. Delta time is the difference between the lap times of two cars or the time difference between a lap time and a reference time. This information is crucial for teams and drivers to understand their performance and make necessary adjustments during the race. Delta time has been an essential part of Formula 1 since its early days and has a rich history. Through the years, the methods and technology used to calculate delta time have evolved, allowing for more precise measurements and a better understanding of how different factors contribute to a car\u2019s performance on the track. It is used not only during actual races but also in practice and qualifying sessions to help teams strategize and optimize their performance. Key Takeaways Delta time is the difference in lap times between two cars or between a lap time and a reference time in Formula 1 racing. It has been an integral part of the sport since its inception and plays a crucial role in measuring performance and informing adjustments. The concept of delta time is utilized across all aspects of Formula 1, including races, practice sessions, and qualifying rounds. Origin and History of Delta Time in Formula 1 Delta time is a valuable concept in Formula 1, providing insights into the performance differences between drivers and cars during races.

That's perhaps the best assessment of the stock market in 2023 at this point. All the major indexes are in positive territory. The S&P 500 is on track to deliver its fourth double-digit percentage gain in the last five years. But don't rest too easily. There are three potential dangers for the stock market in September. Here's what they are -- and how investors can prepare. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Frothy valuations It's possible that the stock market could become a victim of its own success. The impressive performance this year for the S&P 500 has arguably led to a historically high valuation for the index. One of the best ways to assess the valuation of the S&P 500 is the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, also known as the Shiller PE ratio. Popularized by Yale professor Robert Shiller, this ratio compares the index's current share price to its real (inflation-adjusted) earnings per share averaged over a 10-year period. So, how does the Shiller PE ratio for the S&P 500 look these days? In a word, frothy. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts .

Some believe an impending economic slowdown will belie a reversal in equities. Others think this year\u2019s rally may have stronger legs than others give it credit for. Wall Street is abuzz over stock market predictions heading into the final quarter of a relatively strong year for equities. August\u2019s surprise downturn has led some to suspect an imminent correction heading further into September, historically the weakest month for stocks. Others are confident that stocks are bound to reach new highs before the new year. So, what\u2019s the outlook for the fourth quarter? Well, after August\u2019s mild pullback that saw the S&P 500 lose more than 4.5% of its value at its trough, it seems the bulls are back on parade. Indeed, from the S&P\u2019s bottom on Aug. 18, stocks are now up a little more than 2% since then. This also goes for the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite, which is up about 4% since it\u2019s August trough. The success of stocks in the final quarter of the year may well rest on the Federal Reserve. Despite the central bank\u2019s seemingly victorious battle against inflation, several Fed members (including Fed Chair Jerome Powell) have hinted at the possibility of more rate hikes to come. \u201cWe are prepared to raise rates further\n5. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Stock Market & Crypto Currency Update \u2013 September 5th, 2023\nbody: Bottom Line: My first rule of money is to never let your money and emotions cross paths.

The reason is to understand what's possible, though unlikely, so you can plan soundly for your financial future unemotionally. The US stock market is the greatest wealth creation machine in the history of the world. Likewise, cryptos have created generational wealth for many who were early, however most investors in the crypto space have now lost money on their original investments.

Snowflake Incorporated (SNOW): Recent acquisitions and partnerships stand to be a strong long-term growth catalyst. Royal Caribbean Group (RCL): Dominant grasp over the global cruise ship market and multiyear partnership provides unique growth. The United States economy added 187,000 new jobs last month, and this is accompanied by an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate to 3.8% . This in turn raises the odds for the soft landing that the Federal Reserve wanted. In addition, labor force participation increased and earnings growth slowed. This shows a positive outlook for the Federal Reserve goals and the health of the economy as a whole. All of this has lead us to our list of the best long-term stocks to buy right now.

That's perhaps the best assessment of the stock market in 2023 at this point. All the major indexes are in positive territory. The S&P 500 is on track to deliver its fourth double-digit percentage gain in the last five years. But don't rest too easily. There are three potential dangers for the stock market in September. Here's what they are -- and how investors can prepare. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Frothy valuations It's possible that the stock market could become a victim of its own success. The impressive performance this year for the S&P 500 has arguably led to a historically high valuation for the index. One of the best ways to assess the valuation of the S&P 500 is the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, also known as the Shiller PE ratio. Popularized by Yale professor Robert Shiller, this ratio compares the index's current share price to its real (inflation-adjusted) earnings per share averaged over a 10-year period. So, how does the Shiller PE ratio for the S&P 500 look these days? In a word, frothy. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts .

Some believe an impending economic slowdown will belie a reversal in equities. Others think this year\u2019s rally may have stronger legs than others give it credit for. Wall Street is abuzz over stock market predictions heading into the final quarter of a relatively strong year for equities. August\u2019s surprise downturn has led some to suspect an imminent correction heading further into September, historically the weakest month for stocks. Others are confident that stocks are bound to reach new highs before the new year. So, what\u2019s the outlook for the fourth quarter? Well, after August\u2019s mild pullback that saw the S&P 500 lose more than 4.5% of its value at its trough, it seems the bulls are back on parade. Indeed, from the S&P\u2019s bottom on Aug. 18, stocks are now up a little more than 2% since then. This also goes for the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite, which is up about 4% since it\u2019s August trough. The success of stocks in the final quarter of the year may well rest on the Federal Reserve. Despite the central bank\u2019s seemingly victorious battle against inflation, several Fed members (including Fed Chair Jerome Powell) have hinted at the possibility of more rate hikes to come. \u201cWe are prepared to raise rates further\n5. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Stock Market & Crypto Currency Update \u2013 September 5th, 2023\nbody: Bottom Line: My first rule of money is to never let your money and emotions cross paths. The purpose of this story is to inform you as to what's possible in a near worst-case outcome for the financial markets. The reason is to understand what's possible, though unlikely, so you can plan soundly for your financial future unemotionally. The US stock market is the greatest wealth creation machine in the history of the world. Likewise, cryptos have created generational wealth for many who were early, however most investors in the crypto space have now lost money on their original investments. I want you to benefit from investing without making emotional mistakes with money. Historically, when investors attempt to time the market, they end up worse off than if they\u2019d stayed with their original plan over 90% of the time. This is all about combating those types of mistakes. Here's how far the Dow, S&P 500 & Nasdaq are from their record highs: DOW: -5% (+2% last week) S&P 500: -6% (+2% last week) Nasdaq: -13% (flat last week) Markets finished August strong and had a solid start to September, in what\u2019s historically been the weakest month of the year, on back of news that wasn\u2019t great for the economy but that was interpreted as such.

Snowflake Incorporated (SNOW): Recent acquisitions and partnerships stand to be a strong long-term growth catalyst. Royal Caribbean Group (RCL): Dominant grasp over the global cruise ship market and multiyear partnership provides unique growth. The United States economy added 187,000 new jobs last month, and this is accompanied by an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate to 3.8% . This in turn raises the odds for the soft landing that the Federal Reserve wanted. In addition, labor force participation increased and earnings growth slowed. This shows a positive outlook for the Federal Reserve goals and the health of the economy as a whole. All of this has lead us to our list of the best long-term stocks to buy right now.

It\u2019s the longest-running live action show in U.S. history, and it doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down. NBC has renewed Law & Order: SVU for a record setting 25th season, which makes it the rare spin-off to be longer than the original, but fans will have to wait quite a while before they get it. The writers and actors strike have put a halt to everything being made in Hollywood, and with no one to work on scripts for the upcoming season, NBC has decided to push Law & Order: SVU back. It was originally scheduled to air in September 2023, but now it\u2019s looking like it will drop sometime in 2024. When is Law & Order: SVU season 25 coming out? (Release date predictions) The problem is, when in 2024 is still unclear. January would be the obvious best case scenario, as fans would have to wait the least amount of time, and still be able to get a half season worth of new episodes (January marks the mid-season for fall programming). The problem is, the strikes would have to be resolved very soon for a January premiere date to be realistic.

Law & Order: SVU Season 25 isn\u2019t coming this month, but when will it arrive? Fall TV is set to return, but it\u2019s looking very different to normal. We have some bad news for fans of the Dick Wolf shows. None of them are coming back this month, and that includes Law & Order: SVU Season 25. That just means we\u2019re waiting for a month, right? After all, we\u2019ve seen that Quantum Leap and Magnum PI will be back in October. This is where the bad news continues. We\u2019re not going to see new episodes of SVU for the rest of the year. When will Law & Order: SVU Season 25 premiere on NBC? Why would NBC change the schedule so dramatically? Is it a bad sign for the Law & Order franchise? Not at all! NBC didn\u2019t want to change Thursdays too much. This is all linked to the current strike action. Back in May, NBC hoped for things to work out to bring a normal fall. The new schedule didn\u2019t come out until July when the actors joined the writers on strike. There has been little movement since then, and it means that NBC has no choice but to hold off a lot of the scripted content until next year. We don\u2019t know when next year. Maybe there is a chance of the show returning in January. This is all going to depend on when production restarts and when the episodes will be ready. We\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on things. The good news is NBC will bring some Law & Order reruns to kick off Thursday nights. We will also get new episodes of new shows The Irrational and Found and new episodes of Magnum PI.

Is there news on a premiere date coming soon? Well, the first thing that we should note here is that if you\u2019re looking forward to seeing Olivia Benson back this year, you are going to be disappointed. It became clear a little while ago that the entire franchise was not going to be on the NBC fall schedule. The earliest that you will see the show back is mid-to-late January and, odds are, it is going to be later than that. Just remember that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes are still ongoing and as far as we are aware, there is no apparent end to these in strike. The first thing that needs to happen in order to get production underway is for everyone involved to get new contracts that they deserve. This is a TV-wide issue, and we are relying on the studios and streamers to end the strikes (which is admittedly) not an easy thing to do here. Following this, there are a lot of scripts that need to be written, and that is why this process overall is going to take a great deal of time. The best thing we can do is be patient. If there is any SVU news coming this month, it will almost certainly be strike related. If filming starts up in November or December, then maybe at that point we\u2019re going to have a chance to get some more news either about casting, crossovers, or whatever else the future could hold. Obviously, it goes without saying that we want to see Benson and Stabler reunite at some point \u2014 it mostly a matter of when.

When NBC announced the renewals back in the spring, SVU was originally planned to return for Season 25 in the fall (along with L&O Season 23), but OC Season 4 only received an order for 13 episodes and a midseason \u2013 a.k.a. 2024 \u2013 premiere. Now, in light of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes delaying so many TV shows, it's time for fans to reevaluate and try to find a sliver of a silver lining. While we can only speculate at this point as to when the AMPTP will agree to terms with the WGA writers and SAG-AFTRA actors to get TV and film productions moving again, I'm going to assume for argument's sake that both Law & Order: SVU and Organized Crime will be back in the new year, presumably with SVU running for fewer than the original plan for 22 episodes. Could OC and SVU both run for the same amount of episodes, and therefore actually let Mariska Hargitay's Benson and Christopher Meloni's Stabler interact on screen early in their new seasons rather than Benson go half a season seeing neither hide nor hair of her former partner?

We have some bad news for fans of the Dick Wolf shows. None of them are coming back this month, and that includes Law & Order: SVU Season 25. That just means we\u2019re waiting for a month, right? After all, we\u2019ve seen that Quantum Leap and Magnum PI will be back in October. This is where the bad news continues. We\u2019re not going to see new episodes of SVU for the rest of the year. When will Law & Order: SVU Season 25 premiere on NBC? Why would NBC change the schedule so dramatically? Is it a bad sign for the Law & Order franchise? Not at all! NBC didn\u2019t want to change Thursdays too much. This is all linked to the current strike action. Back in May, NBC hoped for things to work out to bring a normal fall. The new schedule didn\u2019t come out until July when the actors joined the writers on strike. There has been little movement since then, and it means that NBC has no choice but to hold off a lot of the scripted content until next year. We don\u2019t know when next year. Maybe there is a chance of the show returning in January. This is all going to depend on when production restarts and when the episodes will be ready. We\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on things. The good news is NBC will bring some Law & Order reruns to kick off Thursday nights. We will also get new episodes of new shows The Irrational and Found and new episodes of Magnum PI. Law & Order:\n4. publish date: 2023-09-07, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Law & Order: SVU season 25 premiere date: September hopes\nbody: As we prepare for the month of September, what is there that we can say when it comes to Law & Order: SVU season 25? Is there news on a premiere date coming soon? Well, the first thing that we should note here is that if you\u2019re looking forward to seeing Olivia Benson back this year, you are going to be disappointed. It became clear a little while ago that the entire franchise was not going to be on the NBC fall schedule. The earliest that you will see the show back is mid-to-late January and, odds are, it is going to be later than that. Just remember that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes are still ongoing and as far as we are aware, there is no apparent end to these in strike. The first thing that needs to happen in order to get production underway is for everyone involved to get new contracts that they deserve. This is a TV-wide issue, and we are relying on the studios and streamers to end the strikes (which is admittedly) not an easy thing to do here. Following this, there are a lot of scripts that need to be written, and that is why this process overall is going to take a great deal of time. The best thing we can do is be patient. If there is any SVU news coming this month, it will almost certainly be strike related. If filming starts up in November or December, then maybe at that point we\u2019re going to have a chance to get some more news either about casting, crossovers, or whatever else the future could hold. Obviously, it goes without saying that we want to see Benson and Stabler reunite at some point \u2014 it mostly a matter of when.

When NBC announced the renewals back in the spring, SVU was originally planned to return for Season 25 in the fall (along with L&O Season 23), but OC Season 4 only received an order for 13 episodes and a midseason \u2013 a.k.a. 2024 \u2013 premiere. Now, in light of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes delaying so many TV shows, it's time for fans to reevaluate and try to find a sliver of a silver lining. While we can only speculate at this point as to when the AMPTP will agree to terms with the WGA writers and SAG-AFTRA actors to get TV and film productions moving again, I'm going to assume for argument's sake that both Law & Order: SVU and Organized Crime will be back in the new year, presumably with SVU running for fewer than the original plan for 22 episodes. Could OC and SVU both run for the same amount of episodes, and therefore actually let Mariska Hargitay's Benson and Christopher Meloni's Stabler interact on screen early in their new seasons rather than Benson go half a season seeing neither hide nor hair of her former partner? After how SVU 's Season 24 finale and OC 's Season 3 finale ended the spring with the two finally on firm footing again with\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The show was originally planned to air in September 2023, but due to the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, production has been delayed and it is now expected to air in mid-to-late January 2024 or later [1]. Therefore, there are currently no seasons of Law & Order: SVU available.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in learning more about the show or its characters, you may want to consider watching previous seasons of Law & Order: SVU, which are available to stream on various platforms such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Video [3]. Additionally, you can check out related questions such as \"What are the best episodes of Law & Order: SVU?\" or \"What is the plot of Law & Order: SVU Season 24?\" for more information on the show.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, Law & Order: SVU was renewed for a record-setting 25th season, which makes it the rare spin-off to be longer than the original. However, the show is currently on a production halt due to the writers and actors strike. As a result, NBC has decided to push the air date of the 25th season to a yet-to-be-determined date in 2024. It had originally been scheduled to air in September 2023. No exact date within 2024 is currently known. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant B provided a more accurate and relevant response to the user's question. While Assistant A incorrectly stated that there are currently no seasons of Law & Order: SVU available, Assistant B correctly identified that the show has been renewed for a 25th season, but its release has been delayed due to a strike.

The Medal of Honor is considered the highest military decoration someone can receive, with recipients\u2019 stories demonstrating moments of bravery and sometimes sacrifice in defense of the United States. Some have gone it alone amid onslaughts of gunfire, and many have faced what would appear to be insurmountable odds, but come out inspiring their fellow servicemembers, with multiple Medal of Honor recipients throwing themselves on grenades to absorb the blast.

Larry Taylor will be the 33rd Tennessean to receive the Medal of Honor, which is the highest military decoration a person can receive for their valor in combat, according to the Coolidge National Medal of Honor Heritage Center in Chattanooga. Biden to award Medal of Honor to Vietnam-era Army officer Taylor distinguished himself while serving as one of the first Cobra helicopter pilots during the Vietnam War. While Taylor was a part of many harrowing operations, the Heritage Center said one operation rises above all others. On the night of June 18, 1968, a four-man Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) team was surveilling a village occupied by around 80 North Vietnamese. A fight ensued and the soldiers quickly realized they were surrounded. After the soldiers radioed for air support, Taylor and his co-pilot J.O. Ratliff, along with one other Cobra helicopter, flew over the area and provided support until they were out of rockets and ammunition. Realizing the LRRP team was surrounded with little, if any, options, Taylor radioed the team leader and made an \u201cunusual request,\u201d according to the Heritage Center. He asked the soldiers to create a diversion, run 100 yards and lie down in the grass.

The Cobra helicopter had no place to transport troops, so Taylor ordered the soldiers to jump onto the helicopter skids and rocket pods and hold on tight. Taylor then lifted the four men, David Hill of Visalia, Cali.; Robert Elsner of New York City; Gerald Patty of Maryville, Tenn.; and William P. Cohn of Norwich, Conn. out of the fight and to a safer location miles away. For his actions that night, Taylor was awarded the Silver Star, which President Biden has now upgraded to a Medal of Honor. The president will present Taylor with the Medal of Honor on Tuesday, Sept. 5 at the White House in Washington D.C. Not only will he be the 33rd Tennessean to receive the decoration, but Taylor will be the sixth soldier with ties to the Chattanooga area to have received the Medal of Honor. He also was awarded 61 combat decorations, including 44 Air Medals, for his service.

The festival, which took place from August 11th to August 13th in San Francisco, featured a diverse and impressive lineup of artists, ranging from pop legends such as Lana Del Rey, to hip-hop stars such as Kendrick Lamar, to EDM sensations such as Odesza. Coming back for their 15th iteration of the festival, Outside Lands had a strong focus on sustainability and social responsibility, with initiatives such as The Mission (previously named Eco Lands), which highlights a specific cause every year, and Inside Lands, which provided access and opportunities for those who could not make the festival in person. Outside Lands continuously finds ways to support the arts and promote artists across all genres and fame. The highlight of the festival was undoubtedly the EDM scene, which was vibrant and exciting, featuring a mix of the biggest names in the industry as well as emerging talents.

His sentence is the longest for any defendant tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and was widely reported by news outlets, including ABC News and NBC News. \u201cTo the men and women of law enforcement who answered the call that day, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tarrio said in a statement before his sentencing. \u201cI have always tried to hold myself to a higher standard and I failed. I failed miserably. I thought of myself morally above others and this trial has humbled me.\u201d Tarrio downplayed that the riot was intended to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cI am not a political zealot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I get back home, I want nothing to do with politics, groups, activism or rallies.\u201d Tarrio\u2019s attorney Sabino Jauregui had told the court that his client \u201cis no terrorist\u201d and branded him a \u201cmisguided patriot\u201d who was trying to protect his country. Prosecutors had asked for a 33-year sentence for the 39-year-old Tarrio. He was one of four Proud Boys found guilty of seditious conspiracy, a serious crime of conspiring against the United States.

Experts, and the flying public, are both concerned about the two carriers. Both groups have authorized a strike. In fact, Google searches for \u2018American Airlines flight attendants\u2019 shot up more than 1,300 percent since August 31. Clearly, people are interested as the winter holidays loom. The country simply can\u2019t afford to have 40 percent of its major airlines sidelined. Southwest is facing a double whammy. It not only has to come to an agreement with its pilots but with its flight attendants as well. But somebody has to fly the planes so it will likely focus on its problems with its pilots\u2019 union first. Southwest pilots and American Airlines flight attendants are currently in federal mediation. It is of some solace that neither group can go on strike while in federal mediation. Both groups have been seen picketing at airports. \"Southwest pilots are ready to strike,\" the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association wrote on its X (formerly Twitter) page. Said Southwest in a statement after a recent pilot demonstration: \"Southwest Airlines respects the rights of our employees to express their opinions, and we do not anticipate any disruption in service because of today\u2019s demonstration of off-duty pilots.

You can expect widespread disruption not only to flights set to land and take off at various French airports but also to those that utilize the country\u2019s airspace if the strike on September 15, 2023, goes forward. Several unions in France represent Air Traffic Controllers, and so far, only the largest one, SNCTA, has given the strike notice, but other unions may join. The union is also planning another work stoppage on October 13, 2023. You should pay attention to this possible strike, especially if you plan to fly to/from/via/over France on the strike date, as there will be many canceled and delayed flights. The EU\u2019s EC 261/2004 legislation required community airlines and those flying from EU/EEA to rebook affected passengers to their final destinations at the earliest opportunity and to provide Duty to Care (hotels and meals) in case of long delays. Conclusion It has been relatively quiet in the work stoppage sector in Europe in the past couple of months, but I assume that strike activity will return now that the summer travel season is over. You should pay attention to these strikes because they affect long-haul flights before and after the strike day and may lead to missed connections and ruined travel plans\n3. publish date: 2023-08-30, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Why, When and Where American Airlines, Southwest Airlines Workers Are Picketing This Week\nbody: Two airline work groups at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport are picketing this week after stalled negotiations have left them without a contract.

If approved, the strike authorization vote would allow the union to call a strike, but only after getting the go-ahead fromthe National Mediation Board.

Labor problems. Southwest Airlines has yet to reach an agreement with its pilots, and neither has American Airlines with its flight attendants. Experts, and the flying public, are both concerned about the two carriers. Both groups have authorized a strike. In fact, Google searches for \u2018American Airlines flight attendants\u2019 shot up more than 1,300 percent since August 31. Clearly, people are interested as the winter holidays loom. The country simply can\u2019t afford to have 40 percent of its major airlines sidelined. Southwest is facing a double whammy. It not only has to come to an agreement with its pilots but with its flight attendants as well. But somebody has to fly the planes so it will likely focus on its problems with its pilots\u2019 union first. Southwest pilots and American Airlines flight attendants are currently in federal mediation. It is of some solace that neither group can go on strike while in federal mediation. Both groups have been seen picketing at airports. \"Southwest pilots are ready to strike,\" the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association wrote on its X (formerly Twitter) page. Said Southwest in a statement after a recent pilot demonstration: \"Southwest Airlines respects the rights of our employees to express their opinions, and we do not anticipate any disruption in service because of today\u2019s demonstration of off-duty pilots. Our contract negotiations continue, with leaders from both parties\n2. publish date: 2023-08-30, Wednesday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: French Air Traffic Controller Strike September 15, 2023\nbody: Transport sector strikes in France are set to continue in September as the Air Traffic Controllers have given notice of a one-day long work stoppage amid the Rugby World Cup. You can expect widespread disruption not only to flights set to land and take off at various French airports but also to those that utilize the country\u2019s airspace if the strike on September 15, 2023, goes forward. Several unions in France represent Air Traffic Controllers, and so far, only the largest one, SNCTA, has given the strike notice, but other unions may join. The union is also planning another work stoppage on October 13, 2023. You should pay attention to this possible strike, especially if you plan to fly to/from/via/over France on the strike date, as there will be many canceled and delayed flights. The EU\u2019s EC 261/2004 legislation required community airlines and those flying from EU/EEA to rebook affected passengers to their final destinations at the earliest opportunity and to provide Duty to Care (hotels and meals) in case of long delays. Conclusion It has been relatively quiet in the work stoppage sector in Europe in the past couple of months, but I assume that strike activity will return now that the summer travel season is over. You should pay attention to these strikes because they affect long-haul flights before and after the strike day and may lead to missed connections and ruined travel plans\n3. publish date: 2023-08-30, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Why, When and Where American Airlines, Southwest Airlines Workers Are Picketing This Week\nbody: Two airline work groups at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport are picketing this week after stalled negotiations have left them without a contract. On Wednesday, American Airlines\u2019 flight attendants, represented by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, will hold a series of informational pickets across 12 bases in the country, including DFW. American\u2019s more than 26,000 flight attendants recently voted for a strike, although it would take a few more legal steps to actually conduct a strike under the Railway Labor Act, and will share results of the vote at the picket. The flight attendants union filed for federal mediation in March with the National Mediation Board, for their contract that they started discussions on in 2019. If approved, the strike authorization vote would allow the union to call a strike, but only after getting the go-ahead fromthe National Mediation Board. However, strike authorization votes don\u2019t necessarily mean a strike will happen, but are used in union negotiations to ramp up pressure. \u201cLabor Day should take on a whole new meaning for American Airlines management this year,\u201d said Julie Hedrick, the union\u2019s national president in a release. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time for significant increases in compensation and improvements to our working conditions.

After two years of negotiations, Transport Workers Union Local 555, which represents the 19,000 workers in ramp, operations, provisioning and freight at Southwest, reached an agreement on Aug. 9 with the Dallas-based carrier. If ratified, the contract would bring on new wages, up to 12 weeks of parental leave and more. Union members will vote beginning Sept. 8 to Sept. 20. \u201cPlanes don\u2019t take off without us,\u201d said Randy Barnes, president of TWU Local 555 in a release. \u201cWhile working in extreme weather, and face-to-face with customers, our members load and unload luggage, supply snacks and beverages to the aircraft, and accept and ship freight. They are the last people passengers see when they board planes and the first people they see when they arrive at their destination.\u201d Adam Carlisle, vice president of labor relations at Southwest, said ground workers serve a valuable role in customer experience. The union representing ground workers was critical of Southwest during operational troubles last summer, saying that poor planning and poor treatment of workers were behind some problems with cancellations and delays.

But Bob Jordan, who took over as CEO early last year after 35 years with the airline, doesn't seem worried. He says the company has fully recovered from 10 days of crew-scheduling chaos over the December 2022 holidays, when the company was forced to essentially shut down to reset its operation. The airline cancelled more than 14,000 flights during the period, with more than 2 million people affected by what Southwest executives call \u201cthe disruption.\u201d Among the most recent changes under Jordan, Southwest last week began a \u201credo\u201d of sorts on contract negotiations with its 10,000 pilots and 15,000 flight attendants after years of failing to reach deals, partially derailed by the pandemic.

Beyond barbecues and the unofficial end of summer, Labor Day holds a rich history and significant meaning that deserves recognition. In this article, we will delve into the origins of Labor Day, its evolution over time, and the enduring importance it holds in our society. The Birth of Labor Day: The concept of Labor Day dates back to the late 19th century, a period of rapid industrialization in the United States. Labor conditions were often harsh, with long working hours, low wages, and minimal worker protections. Amidst growing social tensions, workers' rights organizations and labor unions campaigned for change. The First Labor Day: On September 5, 1882, the Central Labor Union of New York City organized the first Labor Day parade. It was a momentous event that brought together thousands of workers from various trades to march through the streets, demanding better working conditions, shorter hours, and fair wages. This celebration of labor quickly spread throughout the country, leading to the recognition and establishment of Labor Day as a national holiday. Recognized as a National Holiday: In response to the increasing significance of Labor Day, the United States Congress passed an act on June 28, 1894, officially designating the first Monday in September as a national holiday to honor workers. President Grover Cleveland signed the act into law, ensuring that Labor Day would be a recognized and celebrated holiday across the nation. Celebration and Symbolism: Labor Day holds different meanings for different people. For some, it represents the hard-fought victories of the labor movement, marked by improved working conditions, fair wages, and worker rights protections. It is a day to acknowledge the contributions of everyday workers who build and sustain the economy. Beyond BBQs and Sales: While Labor Day has evolved into a day of relaxation, outdoor activities, and shopping deals, it's important to remember its historical significance and honor its original intent.

For most Americans, the long weekend is a much-needed opportunity to reconnect with friends and family and provides a last hurrah before the start of fall. But Monday's holiday holds a much deeper meaning, rooted in the 19th century fight for fair working conditions. Labor Day was originally designed to honor workers as part of the American organized labor movement. When Labor Day started Labor Day was first celebrated unofficially by labor activists and individual states in the late 1800s, according to the US Department of Labor. New York was the first state to introduce a bill recognizing Labor Day, but Oregon was the first to actually codify it into law in 1887. Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had followed suit by the end of 1887. Joshua Freeman, a labor historian and professor emeritus at the City University of New York, tells CNN that the holiday developed as unions were beginning to strengthen again after the 1870s recession. In New York City, two events converged that contributed to the formation of Labor Day, Freeman says. First, the now-defunct Central Labor Union was formed as a \"umbrella body\" for unions across trades and ethnic groups. Additionally, the Knights of Labor, then the largest national labor convention, held a convention in the city, complete with a large parade. But the parade fell on a Tuesday at the start of September \u2013 and many workers were unable to attend. The convention was a huge success, and unions around the country started holding their own labor celebrations at the start of September, usually on the first Monday of the month. At the beginning, \"it was a somewhat daring move to participate, because you could get yourself fired,\" Freedman said. But over time, states began to recognize the holiday, and it became more common for employers to give their employees the day off. It wasn't until June 28, 1894 that Congress passed an act naming the first day of September a legal holiday called Labor Day. Freeman says that earlier that year, President Grover Cleveland sent in the military to squash the Pullman railway strike.

Women began working during World War II and fought to hold their jobs after the war. Today, Labor Day symbolizes appreciation for American workers.

The holiday originated in the late 1800s as a response to the rapid industrialization and growing social tensions in the United States. Labor activists and unions campaigned for better working conditions, shorter hours, and fair wages, and the first Labor Day parade was held in New York City in 1882. In 1894, Congress officially passed an act making the first Monday in September a legal holiday, and President Grover Cleveland signed it into law. Today, many Americans celebrate Labor Day with parades, festivals, and parties, but it is also a time to reflect on the sacrifices of those who came before us and to appreciate the contributions of everyday workers to the nation's prosperity. [1]\n\nIf you have any other questions related to Labor Day or its history, I would be happy to try and assist you.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nLabor Day is celebrated in the United States to honor and recognize the American labor force and their contributions to the development and achievements of the nation. Here are some important points about Labor Day based on the information I found:\n\n- Labor Day celebrations began in the late 19th century, with the first Labor Day parade organized by the Central Labor Union of New York City on September 5, 1882, to demand better working conditions, shorter hours, and fair wages for workers.\n- This movement led to the recognition and establishment of Labor Day as a national holiday. Congress passed an act on June 28, 1894, officially designating the first Monday of September as a national holiday to honor workers.\n- Labor Day is often associated with barbecues, outdoor activities, and shopping deals. However, it's also a day to reflect on the sacrifices made by workers for the betterment of society.\n- The holiday has evolved over time and is now seen as a day to not only honor labor activists and unions but also to express appreciation for all American workers.\n\nPlease note that this information is based on what I found and may not cover all aspects of Labor Day. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question.

The teenager consumed one tortilla chip that, despite no prior health issues or allergies, led to his death several hours later. The challenge involves eating a single chip that's extremely spicy. The boy's mother is sounding a warning about the possible dangers of this viral trend. The chip was created by the company Paqui using what they tout as the world's hottest peppers. There have been multiple hospital cases tied to this product, especially among teenagers. The deceased was identified as Harris Wolobah, a sophomore at Doherty Memorial High School. According to his mother, Lois Wolobah, the chip was given to him by a classmate and he went to the school nurse with a severe stomach ache.

Recently, a 14-year-old boy from Worcester died after attempting the \"One Chip Challenge.\" People are being encouraged to know their limits. Rich Moyette has been making hot sauce for 25 years. His two shops in Massachusetts have one simple rule. \"We do not sample or sell anything to anyone under 18 years old. We will not do it unless a parent is here. We won't do it,\" says Moyette adamantly. \"I saw the news. It's a tragic, tragic story. It's horrible for anyone to pass.\" Moyette sells a similar challenge brand at his store House of Hot Sauce. He's seen someone consume 152 of these at a festival in Vermont. It's basically a tortilla chip covered in scorching spices. It's typically sold in a one chip pouch, however the one Moyette sells has two. \"It's hard to eat, hard to choke down because it's dry. You should drink something with it to get it down,\" said Moyette. \"If I were going to do the hot chip challenge, and I have a high heat level, I am going to try a piece off the top.\" He suggests this because everyone has a different tolerance level, and no chip or hot sauce is created equal. Hot sauces are measured by something called the Scoville scale, however it's not an exact science. \"If you notice 2,500 to 8,000 is the jalape\u00f1o,\" Moyette said. \"You never know which pepper you get, and how hot it is going to be coming off the plant.\" Each pepper is created differently, even within a species. A Carolina Reaper is high on the scale but ranges from 1.4 to 2.2 million Scoville. Moyette makes all customers do a personal hotness test starting with a dollop at the bottom of the scale and moving up. He watches the person's face looking for brow sweat, and redness in the face. \"Red in the eyes is to too far,\" adds Moyette. \"Everyone's body reacts to\n3. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: 'One Chip Challenge' Death: Teen's Tragedy Spurs Review of Viral Trend Safety \nbody: video by @FOX32Chicago A Massachusetts teenager's tragic death following participation in a viral social media trend has led to calls for a review of safety measures associated with such challenges. The 'One Chip Challenge', popular on platforms like TikTok, requires participants to eat a single chip that is purported to be as hot as pepper spray. The chip containing extreme levels of capsaicin, a compound in chili peppers that causes heat, comes from a product by Paqui. This incident has sparked discussions on potential age restrictions for products like these, and the need for more consumer education on their hazards. Symptoms of capsaicin poisoning include acute intestinal issues, intense vomiting, and potential damage to the esophagus.

On its website, the company offers a series of warnings about the chip, including that it is not for children and that medical assistance should be sought if someone who eats the chip has breathing difficulty. Paqui sells packages that contain one chip, with a mix of Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers. For those who eat one, there is sure to be a reaction \u2014 with the challenge being how long the person can hold out without having a glass of water or other drink.

The teenager consumed one tortilla chip that, despite no prior health issues or allergies, led to his death several hours later. The challenge involves eating a single chip that's extremely spicy. The boy's mother is sounding a warning about the possible dangers of this viral trend. The chip was created by the company Paqui using what they tout as the world's hottest peppers. There have been multiple hospital cases tied to this product, especially among teenagers. The deceased was identified as Harris Wolobah, a sophomore at Doherty Memorial High School. According to his mother, Lois Wolobah, the chip was given to him by a classmate and he went to the school nurse with a severe stomach ache.

Recently, a 14-year-old boy from Worcester died after attempting the \"One Chip Challenge.\" People are being encouraged to know their limits. Rich Moyette has been making hot sauce for 25 years. His two shops in Massachusetts have one simple rule. \"We do not sample or sell anything to anyone under 18 years old. We will not do it unless a parent is here. We won't do it,\" says Moyette adamantly. \"I saw the news. It's a tragic, tragic story. It's horrible for anyone to pass.\" Moyette sells a similar challenge brand at his store House of Hot Sauce. He's seen someone consume 152 of these at a festival in Vermont. It's basically a tortilla chip covered in scorching spices. It's typically sold in a one chip pouch, however the one Moyette sells has two. \"It's hard to eat, hard to choke down because it's dry. You should drink something with it to get it down,\" said Moyette. \"If I were going to do the hot chip challenge, and I have a high heat level, I am going to try a piece off the top.\" He suggests this because everyone has a different tolerance level, and no chip or hot sauce is created equal. Hot sauces are measured by something called the Scoville scale, however it's not an exact science. \"If you notice 2,500 to 8,000 is the jalape\u00f1o,\" Moyette said. \"You never know which pepper you get, and how hot it is going to be coming off the plant.\" Each pepper is created differently, even within a species. A Carolina Reaper is high on the scale but ranges from 1.4 to 2.2 million Scoville. Moyette makes all customers do a personal hotness test starting with a dollop at the bottom of the scale and moving up. He watches the person's face looking for brow sweat, and redness in the face. \"Red in the eyes is to too far,\" adds Moyette. \"Everyone's body reacts to\n3. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: 'One Chip Challenge' Death: Teen's Tragedy Spurs Review of Viral Trend Safety \nbody: video by @FOX32Chicago A Massachusetts teenager's tragic death following participation in a viral social media trend has led to calls for a review of safety measures associated with such challenges. The 'One Chip Challenge', popular on platforms like TikTok, requires participants to eat a single chip that is purported to be as hot as pepper spray. The chip containing extreme levels of capsaicin, a compound in chili peppers that causes heat, comes from a product by Paqui. This incident has sparked discussions on potential age restrictions for products like these, and the need for more consumer education on their hazards. Symptoms of capsaicin poisoning include acute intestinal issues, intense vomiting, and potential damage to the esophagus. There are also reports of post-challenge chest pain and heart attacks in some participants.

The goal is internet notoriety, if not a viral reaction. Many of the challenges are on the fun side, such as the Lip Sync Challenge, and others are focused on a cause, such as the Ice Bucket Challenge, an early entry in the viral category. Video proof The challenges take hold on TikTok or other internet platforms, where video proof is part of the game plan. The Milk Crate Challenge topped the popularity charts two years ago, with participants building and climbing towers fashioned out of milk crates. The resulting tumbles were often harmless, good for a few laughs, but the videos that showed injuries were among the most popular. Some of the challenges require daring tasks, bordering on dangerous or illegal. The Kia Boyz Challenge involved stealing a car. The Benadryl Challenge was based on an unhealthy amount of medicine. More: Health information about the Paqui One Chip Challenge Carolina Reaper Some are putting the One Chip Challenge in the risky category. This TikTok trend involves eating a spicy chip without immediately reaching for water. Paqui, the chip maker, markets it as being one of the spiciest available. The rating system for hot peppers, the Scoville Scale, puts Paqui's creation among the hottest. On its website, the company offers a series of warnings about the chip, including that it is not for children and that medical assistance should be sought if someone who eats the chip has breathing difficulty. Paqui sells packages that contain one chip, with a mix of Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers. For those who eat one, there is sure to be a reaction \u2014 with the challenge being how long the person can hold out without having a glass of water or other drink. Paqui has a rating system, with a one-minute wait warranting no praise, up to a one-hour wait deserving of endless praise.

The two-time defending Formula 1 champion easily set a new F1 record with his 10th race win in a row on Sunday in the Italian Grand Prix. Verstappen had to chase the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz through the opening laps, but once he got past Sainz as the Ferrari\u2019s tires wore out quicker than Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull, it was smooth sailing the rest of the way. The win breaks Verstappen\u2019s tie with former Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel for the most consecutive wins. Vettel won nine consecutive races to end the 2013 season as he won his fourth and final title. The victory also extends a record for Red Bull. The win is the 15th consecutive for the team dating back to the final race of 2022. Sergio Perez, who finished second to Verstappen on Sunday, won the second and fourth races of the 2023 season. Verstappen won the 2022 season finale in Abu Dhabi in November, the 2023 season opener in Bahrain and also in Melbourne before starting his 10-race win streak. Verstappen is now 145 points ahead of Perez in the driver\u2019s standings with eight races to go in the season. If Verstappen keeps winning, he will clinch the 2023 title with a handful of races to go. With 25 points available to race winners, Verstappen looks most likely to clinch at the Qatar Grand Prix on Oct. 8. Ferrari finishes ahead of Mercedes Sainz and teammate Charles Leclerc had stellar qualifying pace and sandwiched Verstappen on the grid. Sainz had a good getaway from the pole position and kept Verstappen at bay for as long as he could. But once Verstappen got past, the race was effectively over and Sainz and Leclerc had to worry about staying ahead of Perez. Sainz came home in third ahead of Leclerc in fourth in what\u2019s Ferrari\u2019s home race at Monza. It was still an excellent result for Ferrari as they were able to be ahead of both Mercedes drivers in fifth and sixth. George Russell finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton while Alex Albon was a strong seventh in his Williams ahead of Lando Norris and Fernando Alonso. When could someone else win? The Sept. 24 race in Singapore could be an opportunity for a driver in a non-Red Bull car to win. But at this point, it\u2019s not worth counting on it.

No F1 team has ever swept an entire season\u2019s worth of races and Ferrari and Mercedes have shown enough flashes of pace to make an upset feel feasible at some point this season.

No Formula One driver has ever won as many races in a row in a season. The Red Bull driver had matched the previous all-time record of nine, set by Sebastian Vettel 10 years ago, at last weekend\u2019s Dutch Grand Prix.

He gradually extended his advantage over the chasing pack to finish six seconds ahead of Sergio Perez in second.

[2]\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Max Verstappen's record-breaking season, you may want to consider asking related questions such as:\n\n* How many races has Max Verstappen won in total this season?\n* What is the record for the most consecutive race wins in Formula 1 history before Verstappen's streak?\n* How has Red Bull's dominance this season affected the championship standings?\n\nI hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nMax Verstappen has made history in the Formula One world by winning the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, making it 10 consecutive wins in a row, a feat never achieved before in the sport [1][2][3]. The victory also extends a record for Red Bull, as it is the 15th consecutive win for the team dating back to the final race of 2022 [2].

With no shortage of threats facing the nation, a military promotion blockade in the Senate has emerged as a full-blown national security crisis. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is exercising his authority under Senate rules to halt the promotion of 270 senior military promotions. This number is poised to explode to 650 by the year\u2019s end. With just 852 general and flag officers in the U.S. military, 76% of the nation\u2019s most senior officers are on pace to not be Senate-confirmed by the end of the year. Why the delay? Tuberville disagrees with the Pentagon\u2019s reproductive health care access policy that was issued following the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision.

It\u2019s not just about countries or continents; regional exclusivity also extends to specific geographical features. Take the Vivillon patterns, for instance, which change based on the region\u2019s postcards. Then there\u2019s the celestial duo of Lunatone and Solrock, who prefer specific hemispheres.

Take the Vivillon patterns, for instance, which change based on the region\u2019s postcards. Then there\u2019s the celestial duo of Lunatone and Solrock, who prefer specific hemispheres.

These include measures banning gender-affirming care for minors, banning trans athletes from playing in K-12 sports and prohibiting minors from attending drag story hours and shows. While some of these laws are currently being challenged in court, the growing number of these types of laws is leading to a queer migration of people to places like Oregon that have stronger protections for the LGBTQ+ community, according to service providers here.

He said the student looked around the classroom, saw a small Pride flag, then asked, \u201cAre you gay?\u201d Kerekes said that his identity is no secret and that he is one of a few out gay teachers in his school. But under a new state law that restricts the instruction of LGBTQ topics, he feared that his answer could somehow be illegal, he said. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can tell you that,\u2019\u201d Kerekes said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018Why not?\u2019 And I said, \u2018It\u2019s kind of the state law now.\u2019\u201d Kerekes said the exchange is just one example of the variety of difficult situations that he and his colleagues in Osceola County have had to navigate under Florida\u2019s recently expanded Parental Rights in Education act, or what critics have dubbed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law. Battles over what content is appropriate for children \u2014 in books, history classes, health classes and elsewhere \u2014 are dominating school board meetings and state legislatures across the country. In most of these debates, one side portrays LGBTQ-inclusive curricula and transgender-inclusive school policies as inappropriate or harmful for minors, with some conservative activists and elected officials going so far as to describe such content as \u201cgrooming,\u201d resurfacing a decades-old moral panic about queer people. Nowhere has that battle been more pronounced than in Florida, which made national headlines in the spring of 2022 when the state Legislature debated \u2014 and Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, ultimately signed \u2014 the so-called Don\u2019t Say Gay bill. Initially, the measure prohibited \u201cclassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d in kindergarten through third grade \u201cor in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d DeSantis signed an expanded version of the law in May that prohibits such instruction from prekindergarten through eighth grade and restricts health education in sixth through 12th grade. Seventeen states enacted more than 30 new LGBTQ-related education laws in 2023, which will all be in effect for the 2023-24 school year unless they are blocked in court, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In addition to Florida, five states \u2014 Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina \u2014 enacted restrictions this year on LGBTQ-related instruction in schools.

From the queer media outlet, them, the country\u2019s federal hate crime law now extends to LGBTQIA+ people. In the United States, gender-affirming care was just outlawed in Texas, according to AP News. The government of Canada recently posted a warning to queer individuals traveling into the United States to take their safety into consideration. According to the Human Rights Campaign, over 220 bills have been introduced in 2023 which specifically target transgender and non-binary people. The amount of resources, research, and re-affirming locations for the LGBTQIA+ population in the United States should automatically allow for a law similar to Brazil\u2019s hate speech law to be applied in the United States. From the Pew Research Center, Brazil legalized same-sex marriage on May 5, 2013; two years before the United States would in 2015. Regardless of the separate impact tor each country, this was monumental formal legislation for this to be set in place. I am only able to speak from one perspective, but as a 20 year old queer transman, I could never see homophobic hate speech becoming illegal in the United States. Although I have been lucky enough to not have faced direct hostility from classmates and peers, I am familiar with being called slurs or facing other harassment from strangers and drivers. LGBTQIA+ teenagers, young people, and elders are still facing the treatment they have historically received, even if there has been rapid progression in the past twenty years of American society. Trans persons in Florida should never have to seek refuge in Canada to avoid persecution. Gender-affirming care is life-saving, and I cannot say enough how taking HRT away from trans people will exponentially increase suicide rates among LGBTQIA+ youth. I do not know how to sound like a broken record now, so I will emphasize this. We are in an era where information is the most readily available in human history. If you are still purposely ignoring and dismissing information which could help you understand what it is like to grow up queer in the United States, you are harming millions of people in this country, including yourself. The United States should take action to ban homophobic hate speech and make it punishable by prison sentence, I believe Pittsburgh would benefit from this active legislation immediately. College students have academics, extracurriculars, and general life events on their plate, their safety outside of campus based on their expression or presentation of who they are cannot be another concern. As soon as people learn that hate speech is rooted in a history of violence, I would hope a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d would occur where even if they have never met a queer person, you would take the time to realize that outside your realm of possibility is another person\u2019s reality.

Nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in statehouses across the U.S in 2023. While many were defeated, the ACLU has tracked more than 80 bills that were passed into law. These include measures banning gender-affirming care for minors, banning trans athletes from playing in K-12 sports and prohibiting minors from attending drag story hours and shows. While some of these laws are currently being challenged in court, the growing number of these types of laws is leading to a queer migration of people to places like Oregon that have stronger protections for the LGBTQ+ community, according to service providers here.

The following transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer: Dave Miller: From the Gert Boyle Studio at OPB, this is Think Out Loud. I\u2019m Dave Miller. Nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in statehouses across the country in 2023. Many didn\u2019t pass, but more than 80 bills are now law according to the ACLU. These include measures banning gender affirming care for minors, banning trans athletes from playing K-12 sports, and prohibiting minors from attending drag story hours and shows.

He said the student looked around the classroom, saw a small Pride flag, then asked, \u201cAre you gay?\u201d Kerekes said that his identity is no secret and that he is one of a few out gay teachers in his school. But under a new state law that restricts the instruction of LGBTQ topics, he feared that his answer could somehow be illegal, he said. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can tell you that,\u2019\u201d Kerekes said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018Why not?\u2019 And I said, \u2018It\u2019s kind of the state law now.\u2019\u201d Kerekes said the exchange is just one example of the variety of difficult situations that he and his colleagues in Osceola County have had to navigate under Florida\u2019s recently expanded Parental Rights in Education act, or what critics have dubbed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law. Battles over what content is appropriate for children \u2014 in books, history classes, health classes and elsewhere \u2014 are dominating school board meetings and state legislatures across the country. In most of these debates, one side portrays LGBTQ-inclusive curricula and transgender-inclusive school policies as inappropriate or harmful for minors, with some conservative activists and elected officials going so far as to describe such content as \u201cgrooming,\u201d resurfacing a decades-old moral panic about queer people. Nowhere has that battle been more pronounced than in Florida, which made national headlines in the spring of 2022 when the state Legislature debated \u2014 and Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, ultimately signed \u2014 the so-called Don\u2019t Say Gay bill. Initially, the measure prohibited \u201cclassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d in kindergarten through third grade \u201cor in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d DeSantis signed an expanded version of the law in May that prohibits such instruction from prekindergarten through eighth grade and restricts health education in sixth through 12th grade. Seventeen states enacted more than 30 new LGBTQ-related education laws in 2023, which will all be in effect for the 2023-24 school year unless they are blocked in court, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In addition to Florida, five states \u2014 Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina \u2014 enacted restrictions this year on LGBTQ-related instruction in schools. Currently, 11 states have laws censoring discussions of LGBTQ people or issues in schools and several additional states have laws requiring parental notification of LGBTQ-inclusive curricula, according to the Movement Advancement Project, or M\n3. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: Standardize LGBTQ+ hate crime laws in the United States\nbody: According to a landmark ruling in Brazil, homophobic hate speech is now punishable by a prison sentence. From the queer media outlet, them, the country\u2019s federal hate crime law now extends to LGBTQIA+ people. In the United States, gender-affirming care was just outlawed in Texas, according to AP News. The government of Canada recently posted a warning to queer individuals traveling into the United States to take their safety into consideration. According to the Human Rights Campaign, over 220 bills have been introduced in 2023 which specifically target transgender and non-binary people. The amount of resources, research, and re-affirming locations for the LGBTQIA+ population in the United States should automatically allow for a law similar to Brazil\u2019s hate speech law to be applied in the United States. From the Pew Research Center, Brazil legalized same-sex marriage on May 5, 2013; two years before the United States would in 2015. Regardless of the separate impact tor each country, this was monumental formal legislation for this to be set in place. I am only able to speak from one perspective, but as a 20 year old queer transman, I could never see homophobic hate speech becoming illegal in the United States. Although I have been lucky enough to not have faced direct hostility from classmates and peers, I am familiar with being called slurs or facing other harassment from strangers and drivers. LGBTQIA+ teenagers, young people, and elders are still facing the treatment they have historically received, even if there has been rapid progression in the past twenty years of American society. Trans persons in Florida should never have to seek refuge in Canada to avoid persecution. Gender-affirming care is life-saving, and I cannot say enough how taking HRT away from trans people will exponentially increase suicide rates among LGBTQIA+ youth. I do not know how to sound like a broken record now, so I will emphasize this. We are in an era where information is the most readily available in human history. If you are still purposely ignoring and dismissing information which could help you understand what it is like to grow up queer in the United States, you are harming millions of people in this country, including yourself. The United States should take action to ban homophobic hate speech and make it punishable by prison sentence, I believe Pittsburgh would benefit from this active legislation immediately. College students have academics, extracurriculars, and general life events on their plate, their safety outside of campus based on their expression or presentation of who they are cannot be another concern. As soon as people learn that hate speech is rooted in a history of violence, I would hope a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d would occur where even if they have never met a queer person, you would take the time to realize that outside your realm of possibility is another person\u2019s reality.

Engoron has kept to the date of the trial, set last year. The civil trial will be the first for Trump since he left the White House in 2021 and comes ahead of a slew of criminal trials the former president faces related to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and the improper handling of classified documents. The New York civil trial stems from a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James last year. James had filed the suit against Trump, three of his children and the Trump Organization, alleging an illegal scheme that amassed $250 million by fraudulently overvaluing assets. James seeks to recover $250 million she said was received through deceptive practices and aims to bar Trump and his children Eric, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., from serving as officers or directors in any New York company. Earlier this week, James asked Engoron to sanction Trump and his co-defendants $10,000 each for trying to delay the trial by repeatedly putting forward failed legal arguments. Trump has since demanded that James withdraw her motion for sanctions. \"The people will not accede to defendant's 'demand' that they withdraw their motion for sanctions,\" special counsel Andrew Amer said in a letter to the court Wednesday, obtained by UPI. Amer noted that the court had warned Trump for the second time against using \"borderline frivolous\" legal arguments and that the request to withdraw the motion for sanctions was in and of itself \"frivolous and sanctionable.\"\n2. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Trump keeps asking to move his March hush-money trial date because he's overbooked with criminal trials\nbody: Trump has repeatedly asked the judge in his NYC hush-money case to move the March 25 trial date. Trump's Jan. 6 trial is set for March 4 in DC, and will take more than a month, his lawyer argued. The NYC judge recently told Trump he won't move the date, but invited him to ask again in February. With two lengthy criminal trials scheduled for March, a lawyer for an overbooked Donald Trump has repeatedly asked the judge in the former president's Manhattan hush-money case to consider rescheduling, only to be rebuffed, court filings show. Instead of granting the requested scheduling conference, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan said earlier this month that he's sticking to the current trial date \u2014 at least for now. He invited Trump's lawyer to raise the matter of scheduling again in February. That means Trump remains on track for a March 4 trial, in Washington, DC, on conspiracy and obstruction charges related to the deadly Capitol riot. A Manhattan trial on charges that he lied in business documents to hide a 2016 hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels is scheduled to kick-off on March 25. Trump also has the March 5, Super Tuesday primaries to contend with. \"I have decided to adhere to the existing schedule,\" Merchan wrote earlier this month to Trump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche. \"We can discuss scheduling and make any necessary changes when we next meet on February 15, 2024.\" Trump's lawyers have had a run of bad luck in trying to talk Manhattan judges into delaying his trials. On Wednesday, the judge who will preside over Trump's October 2 civil business-fraud trial, New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, called a similar delay-the-date bid \"completely without merit.\" In asking, without luck, to at least talk about a new hush-money trial date, Blanche, too, sounded overbooked. The lawyer noted in an August 30 letter to Merchan that he is \"counsel of record\" for the DC case, the hush-money case, and \"another federal trial scheduled to begin on May 20, 2024,\" meaning the Mar-a-Lago documents trial in Florida. Federal prosecutors have estimated that the DC trial \u2014 not including jury selection \u2014 will span four to six weeks, Blanche told Merchan in his letter. \"Thus, the trial in that case will necessarily conflict with the scheduled trial in this case,\" Blanche noted. \"In order for President Trump's trial team to be ready for the D.C. trial in March 2024 \u2013 one that involves millions of documents, complex factual and legal issues, and is a mere 6 months away \u2013 it will require the full attention of President Trump's full legal team,\" Blanche told Merchan.

Here are some key points:\n\n- Trump's legal team has been trying to delay his trial date on business fraud accusations in New York. The judge, however, has ruled that these efforts are \"completely without merit\" and has kept to the scheduled date for the trial [1].\n- Trump's lawyers are also trying to delay his hush-money trial scheduled for March 25 in New York. They cite the busy schedule of Trump, who is also facing multiple other trials, as a reason for the delay. The judge, however, has not granted the requested scheduling conference and has stated that he's sticking to the current trial date for now [2].\n- Trump's lawyers are also asking to talk about a new hush-money trial date due to the busy schedule and other trials. However, the judge has stated that they can discuss scheduling and make any necessary changes when they next meet on February 15, 2024 [2].\n\nSo, based on these points, the reasons for the delay in Donald Trump's trial dates include:\n\n- The judge ruling that efforts to delay the fraud trial are \"completely without merit\" [1].\n- The judge not granting the requested scheduling conference and adhering to the current trial date for the hush-money case [2].\n- The busy schedule of Trump, which includes multiple other trials [2].\n- The request to talk about a new hush-money trial date, which will be discussed when they next meet in February 2024 [2].\n\nPlease note that while these reasons are based on the current information, the situation may change and further delays could potentially occur. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information provided, it appears that Trump's trial dates may be delayed due to his legal team's request for a continuance. According to the article published on August 28th, Trump's lawyers have asked for a delay in the trial date, citing a conflict with another trial scheduled for March 4th in Washington, DC. The article states that Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, noted in a letter to the court that the DC trial is expected to take more than a month and will conflict with the scheduled trial date in New York.\n\nHowever, the article also states that the judge in the case, Justice Arthur Engoron, has so far refused to grant the delay request, stating that the arguments put forward by Trump's legal team are \"completely without merit.\"\n\nTherefore, it is unclear at this time whether Trump's trial dates will be delayed or not. It is possible that the judge may reconsider the request for a delay or that Trump's legal team may appeal the decision.\n\nIn any case, it is important to note that the trial dates are currently set for March 25th in New York and March 4th in Washington, DC. It is possible that these dates may be rescheduled or that the trials may be delayed due to the ongoing legal proceedings.\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more comprehensive and detailed answer, citing the specific reasons for the attempted delays in Trump's trials, including the judge's rulings and Trump's busy schedule with multiple trials. Assistant B's response is also accurate, but it does not provide as much detail as Assistant A's response. Therefore, Assistant A's response is better.

According to the article published on August 28th, Trump's lawyers have asked for a delay in the trial date, citing a conflict with another trial scheduled for March 4th in Washington, DC. The article states that Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, noted in a letter to the court that the DC trial is expected to take more than a month and will conflict with the scheduled trial date in New York.\n\nHowever, the article also states that the judge in the case, Justice Arthur Engoron, has so far refused to grant the delay request, stating that the arguments put forward by Trump's legal team are \"completely without merit.\"\n\nTherefore, it is unclear at this time whether Trump's trial dates will be delayed or not. It is possible that the judge may reconsider the request for a delay or that Trump's legal team may appeal the decision.\n\nIn any case, it is important to note that the trial dates are currently set for March 25th in New York and March 4th in Washington, DC. It is possible that these dates may be rescheduled or that the trials may be delayed due to the ongoing legal proceedings.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, Donald Trump's legal team has been trying to delay his trial dates on various grounds. Here are some key points:\n\n- Trump's legal team has been trying to delay his trial date on business fraud accusations in New York. The judge, however, has ruled that these efforts are \"completely without merit\" and has kept to the scheduled date for the trial [1].\n- Trump's lawyers are also trying to delay his hush-money trial scheduled for March 25 in New York. They cite the busy schedule of Trump, who is also facing multiple other trials, as a reason for the delay. The judge, however, has not granted the requested scheduling conference and has stated that he's sticking to the current trial date for now [2].\n- Trump's lawyers are also asking to talk about a new hush-money trial date due to the busy schedule and other trials. However, the judge has stated that they can discuss scheduling and make any necessary changes when they next meet on February 15, 2024 [2].\n\nSo, based on these points, the reasons for the delay in Donald Trump's trial dates include:\n\n- The judge ruling that efforts to delay the fraud trial are \"completely without merit\" [1].\n- The judge not granting the requested scheduling conference and adhering to the current trial date for the hush-money case [2].\n- The busy schedule of Trump, which includes multiple other trials [2].\n- The request to talk about a new hush-money trial date, which will be discussed when they next meet in February 2024 [2].\n\nPlease note that while these reasons are based on the current information, the situation may change and further delays could potentially occur. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide accurate and relevant responses to the user's question. They both correctly identify that Trump's legal team has requested delays due to scheduling conflicts with other trials, and that the judges have so far denied these requests. However, Assistant B provides a more detailed breakdown of the different trials and the specific reasons for the requested delays, making it easier for the user to understand the situation. Therefore, Assistant B's response is more comprehensive and clear. So, my final verdict is: [[B]].", "turn": 1, "tstamp": 1695173434.689105}

The Woodbridge man was serving a 13-year sentence for aggravated malicious wounding, grand larceny and hit and run, according to Virginia Department of Corrections officials. Officials describe 21-year-old Naseem Roulack as 5\u20198\u2033 tall, weighing about 225 pounds, and has multiple tattoos including one on his right cheek that says: \u201cCut throat.\u201d Roulack, a Greensville Correctional Center inmate escaped while he was getting medical care in St. Mary's Hospital in Henrico County. He escaped when two officers watching him reportedly fell asleep after having worked more than 24 hours, according to Crime Insider sources. Virginia Department of Corrections officials said the pair \"did not work 24 hours.\" However, they did not specify how long the officers had worked. Neither did they deny that the two officers fell asleep. Now Virginia residents want to know where the escaped inmate is and why he is still on the run almost a month later. What investigators are saying Investigators are still providing the same answer that this investigation is \u201congoing.\u201d However, Virginia residents want to know more than that.

However, he is serving time for malicious wounding. Of course, we ask anyone not to approach him.\u201d About a week after Roulack\u2019s escape, the U.S. Marshals Service offered a $5,000 reward for useful information.

Despite the large crowds attending the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, the Electric Zoo music festival and West Indian Day Parade, major crime was down 9% last weekend compared to the same period last year, Mayor Eric Adams said. \u201cThe approach was clear: How do we celebrate without allowing people to be harmed by those who want to bring violence in this city?\u201d Adams said. The mayor continued, \"Not only was this past weekend a historic success, one most recent crime stat shows that we are making significant progress on lowering crime overall.\" There were four shooting incidents in Brooklyn last weekend, according to NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, a dramatic decrease from nine homicides and 29 shooting victims in 2021. The NYPD announced last week that it would use drones to monitor Labor Day festivities, sending images to a control operations unit at police headquarters. The data helped field commanders determine how many officers to send to a scene, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said. The technology came in handy last weekend when more than 88,000 people crammed into the Electric Zoo festival venue on Randall\u2019s Island. The two-day event hit dangerous levels of overcapacity due to thousands of fake ticket and wristband sales, according to Chell. Chell said police used drones to respond quickly to 911 calls about overcrowding, leaving this year\u2019s Electric Zoo festival safer than last with 41% fewer crimes and 175% more arrests. \u201cIt would have been impossible to get a full scope on the size of the crowd if we didn\u2019t have the technology to do so,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt costs $1,700 to fill up a helicopter that is used in situations like this. It costs 17 cents to fly a drone,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s just good use of New York tax dollars.\u201d\n2. publish date: 2023-09-01, Friday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: State Police to Crack Down on Impaired and Reckless Driving this Labor Day Weekend\nbody: The New York State Police will increase patrols to combat drunk, impaired, and reckless driving throughout this Labor Day weekend. The special enforcement period starts on Friday, September 1, 2023, and runs through Monday, September 4, 2023. Labor Day weekend traditionally results in heavy traffic throughout the state. This increased flow of traffic also brings with it an increase in accidents, serious injuries, and fatalities and police will be out in force to remove impaired and reckless drivers from our highways. New York State Police Acting Superintendent Steven A. Nigrelli said, \u201cTraffic safety is a top priority, and each day Troopers work to ensure the well-being of all those who utilize New York\u2019s roadways. Our goal during this enforcement is to ensure we can take intoxicated and drug impaired drivers off our roadways before they injure or kill others. Our Troopers will remain vigilant to remove reckless drivers from our roads and hold them accountable for their actions. I thank the Governor\u2019s Traffic Safety Committee for their support in conducting pivotal traffic enforcements such as this.\u201d Drivers can expect to see sobriety checkpoints and increased patrols by State Police and local law enforcement agencies during this holiday weekend. Troopers will be using both marked State Police vehicles and Concealed Identity Traffic Enforcement (CITE) vehicles as part of this crackdown to more easily identify motorists who are violating the law. CITE vehicles allow the Trooper to better observe driving violations. These vehicles blend in with everyday traffic but are unmistakable as emergency vehicles once the emergency lighting is activated. This initiative is partially funded by the Governor\u2019s Traffic Safety Committee (GTSC). The GTSC and the New York State STOP-DWI Foundation remind motorists that their \u201cHave a Plan\u201d mobile app is available for Apple, Droid and Windows smartphones. The app enables New Yorkers to locate and call a taxi service and program a designated driver list. It also provides information on DWI laws and penalties, and a way to even report a suspected impaired driver. On Labor Day weekend in 2022, Troopers arrested 191 people for DWI, issued 9,580 total tickets, and investigated 140 crashes, which resulted in three fatalities.\n3. publish date: 2023-09-01, Friday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: NYPD using surveillance drones to monitor Labor Day parties\nbody: Labor Day celebrations are sure to be underway in New York City this weekend, but now people have more than just burnt hot dogs and intoxicated friends to worry about: Police surveillance drones crashing the party. The New York City Police department announced that it plans to use unmanned aircraft to respond to noise complaints and large gatherings, including private events, over the holiday weekend. \"If a caller states there\u2019s a large crowd, a large party in a backyard, we\u2019re going to be utilizing our assets to go up and go check on the party to make sure if the call is founded or not,\" assistant NYPD Commissioner Kaz Daughtry said at a live press conference Thursday. However, the department mentioned that Labor Day won't be the only event being celebrated this weekend. Police will also be focused on J\u2019Ouvert, an annual Caribbean festival that marks the end of slavery and draws thousands of revelers to the city. However, as the Associated Press reported, the drone plan raises some serious concerns about privacy and whether it violates existing police surveillance laws. New York City's POST Act requires police to share any plans on new surveillance technology at least 90 days prior, allowing the public time to comment. But in this instance, the department has not done so. While the NYPD did publish a document in 2021 listing ways it plans to use drones for surveillance and responding to crime scenes, it didn't mention anything related to nosy neighbors complaining about backyard parties. Like many cities, New York has increasingly relied on drones for surveillance and policing purposes. According to a recent report from the American Civil Liberties Union, some 1,400 police departments across the country are currently using drones at some capacity. \"American police departments have begun making the case that they should be permitted to fly drones broadly across cities and towns for purposes such as responding to emergencies, but they are already being used far more broadly than many realize, and their use is likely to broaden even more,\" said Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. \"We recommend that communities put in place statutory guardrails to ensure that drone use does not overspill reasonable limits, and that they do not initiate DFR (Drone as First Responder) programs until we have a better sense of how this technology is playing out in the real world.\"\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The main thing that plagued the Tigers in 2022 was far too inconsistent quarterback play. Not only is having a steady quarterback under center the name of the game if you want to be successful, but Clemson has gotten to the point of their program where even 11 wins a season is considered a failure due to such lofty national championship hopes.

The proposed scheduling order sets March 4, 2024 as the commencing trial date. If approved, the trial would begin eight days before Georgia\u2019s presidential primary on March 12, and just one day before Super Tuesday, when the greatest number of states hold its primary elections and caucuses. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is the prosecutor leading the case, also requested an arraignment date of September 5, 2023. Legal counsel for Trump and his co-defendants would then have until September 29 to submit any discovery materials. Willis has already set a deadline of noon on Aug. 25 for all 19 defendants to turn themselves in at the Fulton County Jail for booking. The case has been assigned to newly-appointed Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who was nominated to fill a vacancy on the bench earlier this year by Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp. \u201cIn light of defendant Donald Trump\u2019s other criminal and civil matters pending in the courts of our sister sovereigns, the state of Georgia proposes certain deadlines that do not conflict with these other courts\u2019 already scheduled hearings and trial dates,\u201d Willis\u2019s motion states. \"Further, the proposed dates are requested so as to allow the Defendants\u2019 needs to review discovery and prepare for trial but also to protect the State of Georgia\u2019s and the public\u2019s interest in a prompt resolution of the charges for which the Defendants have been indicted.\" As legal challenges from the defendants are likely to arise over the coming months, the proposed dates could potentially change even if approved by the judge. One of the defendants, Trump's former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, already filed a motion on Tuesday seeking to transfer the case from state to federal court. Meadows argued that because the alleged actions he took were during his time as a government official, he should be granted immunity from prosecution. During a press conference on Monday, Willis said she\u2019s aiming for a trial date to be within the next six months and intends to try all 19 defendants together, which could cause for a lengthy and challenging trial. In another unrelated high-profile RICO case brought by Willis against several defendants including hip-hop artist \"Young Thug,\" a single juror has yet to be seated since jury selection began in January. If the requested trial date is approved, the federal trial for Trump's alleged criminal attempt to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election will have already begun.

The 2023-24 NBA season will be here before you know it. And with training camp less than a month away, it's time to prepare for what should be another season of intense competition. There are plenty of storylines to follow since the Denver Nuggets beat the Miami Heat for the NBA title in June. Players seeking trades before the season kicks off? Hello, James Harden and Damian Lillard . MVPs entering the final year of their deals? That'll be Giannis Antetokounmpo . Legends wanting perhaps one last title shot? LeBron James and Chris Paul , here we go. Every team is getting ready to take their shot at the title, and there's no shortage of star-laden squads looking to knock off Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets. We know about the Golden State Warriors , Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics -- not to mention sleeper picks like the Minnesota Timberwolves . But what teams just need to put together a solid season? (Looking at you, Dallas Mavericks .) There are a lot of questions surrounding the landscape of the 2023-24 season, and our experts broke down the biggest ones ahead of the preseason. Let's dive in. 1. The Nuggets are heavy favorites to repeat (according to us) . Which team is in the best position to knock them out in a best-of-seven? Jamal Collier: I'm going with the Suns, who had a strong offseason to give Kevin Durant and Devin Booker some help after they were not able to carry the team past the Nuggets by themselves last playoffs. The acquisition of Bradley Beal and some smart additions to fill out the roster this offseason -- Keita Bates-Diop , Yuta Watanabe and Jordan Goodwin -- gives Phoenix a reputable bench to surround their stars. Beal should thrive in his new role, and being a third option will make a lot of people remember how talented of a scorer he is. Phoenix looks like Denver's best challenger in the West.

The newly re-signed swingman out of the University of Oklahoma is a reserve on Team USA, but has been a big contributor thus far. New York Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson and Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star shooting guard Anthony Edwards comprise the program's starting backcourt. The Americans beat Team Italy in a 100-63 blowout during the quarterfinals, and now will get a three-day reprieve before their semifinal matchup. That victory, by the way, means that Team USA has now bested its most recent finish at the last World Cup (a paltry seventh place). So the big question now becomes: after a Sunday stumble, can the Americans win their second straight in Manila? To stay alive in the tournament, they're going to have to! The club will face off against the winner of ex-Lakers point guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der and Team Germany's impending matchup against Team Latvia, which is set for tomorrow. Germany, one of the tougher teams in tourney (and still undefeated at 5-0) is favored.

With the Americans leading just 72-68 in the fourth quarter, Reaves extended the lead to 75-68 with his shot with 2:44 remaining. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those plays if it goes in, I look good,\u201d Reaves said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, everybody\u2019s looking at me sideways.

Team USA trailed Montenegro, a 26.5-point underdog, by one point at halftime (39-38). Reaves played just under 25 minutes off the bench and made nine of 11 free-throw attempts. The 3-pointer was his only made field goal in two attempts. The University of Oklahoma product has been a vital player for Team USA during the tournament, helping it to four wins without a loss. He is averaging 11.8 points, 3.8 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game playing 20.9 minutes per contest. Reaves set the tone for the tournament right away with a standout performance against New Zealand in the Americans\u2019 opening game. It\u2019s a continuation of his standout play during the 2022-23 NBA season, when he emerged as arguably the Lakers\u2019 third-best player behind LeBron James and Anthony Davis. He helped them rally late in the regular season and then all the way to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. He averaged 16.9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game during the 2023 playoffs and was rewarded with a four-year contract worth about $\n2. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: FIBA World Cup 2023 Semi-Finals: Qualified Teams, Schedule, Odds and Predictions\nbody: The United States, Germany, Serbia and Canada are still in contention to win the 2023 FIBA World Cup. Three of the four nations have been to the semifinal stage of the World Cup before. Canada is making its first-ever final four appearance. The two North American and European sides locked up qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics with their semifinal berths, so all they have to worry about now is winning the tournament. The top two finishers from Europe and North American automatically qualified for Paris. The Americans opened as a double-digit favorite against Germany, but the European side could be a tougher opponent than the odds suggest. Strong defensive play has been a staple for Germany and Serbia throughout the tournament, and that could produce two tight semifinals in the Philippines on Friday. Semifinal Schedule 1 of 3 Friday, September 8 Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook. Serbia vs. Canada (4:45 a.m. ET, ESPN+) United States (-10.5) vs. Germany (8:30 a.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN+) Predictions against the spread in bold. United States vs. Germany 2 of 3 The United States already produced a better finish than the disastrous 2019 World Cup. Anthony Edwards, Austin Reaves and Co. returned the United States to their normal position in the final four of the World Cup with a 37-point win over Italy on Tuesday. Germany stands in the way of the Americans and the final. The European side will difficult to play against with Dennis Schroder running the show. Germany is one win away from confirming its best-ever World Cup finish. Its current best mark is third place from 2002. Schroder and Franz Wagner are Germany's biggest scoring threats, and that is actually good news for the Americans, who have plenty of guards and wings to defend on the roster. The United States' biggest weakness is in the paint, but Germany does not have an overwhelming paint presence, like Lithuania had with Jonas Valanciunas. As long as Edwards, Reaves and Tyrese Haliburton continue to play well on the perimeter, the Americans should\n3. publish date: 2023-09-04, Monday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Biggest 2023-24 NBA preseason questions and predictions\nbody: Get ready! The 2023-24 NBA season will be here before you know it. And with training camp less than a month away, it's time to prepare for what should be another season of intense competition. There are plenty of storylines to follow since the Denver Nuggets beat the Miami Heat for the NBA title in June. Players seeking trades before the season kicks off? Hello, James Harden and Damian Lillard . MVPs entering the final year of their deals? That'll be Giannis Antetokounmpo . Legends wanting perhaps one last title shot? LeBron James and Chris Paul , here we go. Every team is getting ready to take their shot at the title, and there's no shortage of star-laden squads looking to knock off Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets. We know about the Golden State Warriors , Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics -- not to mention sleeper picks like the Minnesota Timberwolves . But what teams just need to put together a solid season? (Looking at you, Dallas Mavericks .) There are a lot of questions surrounding the landscape of the 2023-24 season, and our experts broke down the biggest ones ahead of the preseason. Let's dive in. 1. The Nuggets are heavy favorites to repeat (according to us) . Which team is in the best position to knock them out in a best-of-seven? Jamal Collier: I'm going with the Suns, who had a strong offseason to give Kevin Durant and Devin Booker some help after they were not able to carry the team past the Nuggets by themselves last playoffs. The acquisition of Bradley Beal and some smart additions to fill out the roster this offseason -- Keita Bates-Diop , Yuta Watanabe and Jordan Goodwin -- gives Phoenix a reputable bench to surround their stars. Beal should thrive in his new role, and being a third option will make a lot of people remember how talented of a scorer he is. Phoenix looks like Denver's best challenger in the West.

The newly re-signed swingman out of the University of Oklahoma is a reserve on Team USA, but has been a big contributor thus far. New York Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson and Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star shooting guard Anthony Edwards comprise the program's starting backcourt. The Americans beat Team Italy in a 100-63 blowout during the quarterfinals, and now will get a three-day reprieve before their semifinal matchup. That victory, by the way, means that Team USA has now bested its most recent finish at the last World Cup (a paltry seventh place). So the big question now becomes: after a Sunday stumble, can the Americans win their second straight in Manila? To stay alive in the tournament, they're going to have to! The club will face off against the winner of ex-Lakers point guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der and Team Germany's impending matchup against Team Latvia, which is set for tomorrow. Germany, one of the tougher teams in tourney (and still undefeated at 5-0) is favored. Per USA Basketball's official website , Team USA's next game is set for Friday, September 8th, at 5:40 a.m. PT and will be broadcast on ESPN 2.

The Long History of Pandas Abroad, Explained\nbody: When you think of fuzzy white paws and adorable black ears, chances are, you're thinking of a panda bear . These bears are native to China and eat a steady diet of foliage composed mostly of bamboo. The creatures are also most notable as a national symbol of China, but starting in 1961, they have also served as the mascots for the World Wildlife Fund following their endangered status . Due to their popularity globally, the National Zoo in Washington D.C. has received a lot of attention for hosting \"gift\" pandas since 1972. However, according to NPR , the National Zoo will officially return its three pandas to China on Dec. 7, 2023. Why are pandas going back to China? Here's the long history of pandas abroad explained. So, why are pandas going back to China? Two pandas, Mei Xiang, and Tian Tian, first arrived at the National Zoo in 2000 as part of an agreement between the National Zoo and the China Wildlife and Conservation Association. CBS News reported that the pair were meant to spend only 10 years at the zoo as part of an international breeding and conservation agreement. China extended the agreement in 2020 after the birth of the male cub Xiao Qi Ji, but the extension was only until 2023. It's unclear where the pandas will return once they reach China.

Yang Guang and Tian Tian have lived at Edinburgh Zoo since 2011 and are the only giant pandas currently living in the UK. Keepers at the zoo had hoped that the pandas would mate but after there were no baby pandas, they gave up. The pandas were loaned to the zoo by the Chinese government, as part of their panda diplomacy scheme, and will return to the country later this year. What is panda diplomacy? Pandas are native to China where they're seen as a national treasure. All living pandas, wherever they might be, belong to the Chinese state, and no one else other than the Chinese government is allowed to own one. Panda diplomacy describes how the Chinese authorities let some governments borrow pandas as a mark of respect between their countries. Having a panda can really boost the status of a zoo, as Edinburgh Zoo saw since Tian Tian arrived in 2011. There aren't many zoos in the world that get to keep pandas - this is because it is up to China to decide which countries get them. Each zoo also has to pass strict tests to be allowed a panda, and it also costs a lot of money. Yang Guang and Tian Tian reportedly cost around \u00a3750,000 a year to loan. As well as paying the Chinese government to loan the pandas, feeding and caring for them is very expensive too. Alison Maclean, the carnivore team leader at Edinburgh Zoo, said: \"We are making arrangements with our partners in China for Yang Guang and Tian Tian to return in early December, possibly during the first week. \"Visitors to the zoo can expect to see them indoors and outside until the end of November, after which viewing will be outdoors only until they leave.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Each zoo also has to pass strict tests to be allowed a panda, and it also costs a lot of money. Yang Guang and Tian Tian reportedly cost around \u00a3750,000 a year to loan. As well as paying the Chinese government to loan the pandas, feeding and caring for them is very expensive too. Alison Maclean, the carnivore team leader at Edinburgh Zoo, said: \"We are making arrangements with our partners in China for Yang Guang and Tian Tian to return in early December, possibly during the first week. \"Visitors to the zoo can expect to see them indoors and outside until the end of November, after which viewing will be outdoors only until they leave.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The National Zoo's giant pandas, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, are set to return to China by December 7, 2023, and it is not mentioned if any new pandas will be sent to America. [1]\n\nHowever, the article does mention that the Smithsonian National Zoo is working with Chinese partners to develop a new giant panda program, which could potentially lead to more pandas coming to America in the future. [5]\n\nIt's worth noting that the decision to bring pandas to America is made by the Chinese government, and it is not guaranteed that they will continue to loan pandas to the United States. [3]\n\nIf you have any related questions, you may want to ask:\n\n* What is the status of the giant panda program at the Smithsonian National Zoo?\n* Will the National Zoo be getting any new pandas in the future?\n* What are the challenges and benefits of having giant pandas at the National Zoo?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, three pandas, including Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and Xiao Qi Ji, are set to return to China from the National Zoo in Washington D.C. on December 7, 2023, as part of an agreement with the China Wildlife and Conservation Association. The pandas were originally meant to spend 10 years at the zoo as part of an international breeding and conservation agreement. This agreement was extended in 2020 after the birth of Xiao Qi Ji, but the extension was only until 2023. It's unclear if more pandas will come to America after these pandas return to China. For more precise information, you may want to check any updates from the China Wildlife and Conservation Association or the National Zoo. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more comprehensive answer by mentioning the possibility of a new giant panda program being developed with Chinese partners, which could potentially lead to more pandas coming to America in the future.

With an estimated 140,000 attendees and 278 vibrant booths at the Los Angeles Convention Center complex over three unforgettable days, this year\u2019s KCON LA was a true spectacle. From meet-and-greets and mesmerizing workshops to delectable food, a dazzling red carpet, captivating dance showcases and extraordinary live performances, the event had it all. In its 11th year, KCON LA extended its festivities to three action-packed days instead of the usual two. While artists like Stray Kids, ATEEZ, Rain, NCT\u2019s Taeyong, SHINee\u2019s Taemin and SM\u2019s newest sensation, RIIZE, set the Crypto.com Arena ablaze with their showmanship, it was the girl groups who added a charming magic to the mix. Here are eight outstanding girl group moments from KCON LA 2023, because when these ladies took the stage, they devoured the spotlight and left no crumbs behind. 8. Lapillus x EVERGLOW KCON's magnetic allure lies in its ability to seamlessly amalgamate an array of diverse talents onto one electrifying stage. As the curtains rose on the third night's concert, the convergence of MLD Entertainment's beguiling girl group, Lapillus, and Yuehua Entertainment's darling EVERGLOW was a jolting surprise. The two groups joined together in dynamic choreography before Lapillus vaulted into their fervent girl crush anthem \u201cWho\u2019s Next?\u201d With its echoing and boisterous harmonics, the song ignited a fire for the rest of the evening and posed a challenge to the acts to follow. 7.

Their former leader Enrique Tarrio received the longest of them all, 22 years. He prepared the assault over a number of weeks and then orchestrated and encouraged the violence on the day, the court heard. Several other members have also been sent to jail for many years. But how did a group that started as a drinking club seven years ago become one of the main organised groups at the Capitol riot? And in what form will they continue now some of their leaders are behind bars? What next for the group? Shortly before several members were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the Capitol riot, the group's founder Gavin McInnes told the BBC that long prison sentences will make the make the group's leaders into \"martyrs for the cause\", and insisted the group will continue despite its current lack of leadership. \"It's just set in stone and you can't kill it. There's no top, there's no head,\" he said. The defendants \"did something wrong\" by entering the Capitol, but said he believes their actions amounted to relatively minor offences. Unlike some of the other organised groups involved in the Capitol riot which have since ceased operations, local Proud Boy chapters continue to remain active across the country. Expert observers largely agree that the Proud Boys will continue and may even prosper. Samantha Kutner, a researcher who's written about the group and is co-founder of Glitterpill LLC, an anti-extremism consultancy group, says that given the increasing politicisation after the Capitol riots, the convictions may give the Proud Boys a boost. \"It will give them more momentum,\" she says. \"Every time they lose it furthers their martyrdom and persecution complex.\" In an audio interview on Twitter which Tarrio joined via phone from his jail cell just after arguments ended in the court case, the former Proud Boys leader accused authorities of \"weaponising\" the justice system and likened the current US government to the regime in Nazi Germany. \"This is not the end of the Proud Boys,\"\n4. publish date: 2023-09-07, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: A River\u2019s Destiny: The battle for wild and scenic status\nbody: Part One By Jack Igelman, Carolina Public Press August 21, 2023 \u201cA River\u2019s Destiny\u201d is a two-part investigative project reported by Jack Igelman. The project tells the history of the North Fork, how conservationists have long advocated for its special federal protection, and the process to achieve wild and scenic status for its preservation. This is part one of the investigation. As it winds its way through rugged landscapes, diverse ecosystems, and cherished recreational areas, the French Broad River in Western North Carolina is believed to be one of the oldest rivers in the world. Paddlers, conservationists, and other river enthusiasts have long advocated for special federal protection for one of its most beloved tributaries in Transylvania County. But achieving the coveted designation for the North Fork of the French Broad and similar rivers is like navigating a challenging whitewater stream. It involves skillfully maneuvering through government bureaucracy, adding years of study and review to the designation process. This complex and prolonged process requires support from local government, legislation enacted by Congress and the president\u2019s signature. Harrison Metzger of Mills River in Henderson County is perhaps one of the North Fork\u2019s fiercest advocates and is supporting the effort in neighboring Transylvania County to gain federal protection for this whitewater paddling destination within Pisgah National Forest. Not only has he paddled the river dozens of times, but as a local journalist in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the Hendersonville Times-News , he reported on the thwarted effort to dam the North Fork and five other tributaries of the French Broad River. Metzger calls the North Fork a \u201chidden treasure\u201d and views it as a highly accessible creek run in Western North Carolina, treasured for its tight and steep features by whitewater boaters, especially during and after heavy rainfall. Supporters like Metzger have helped generate enthusiasm and support for federal wild and scenic status to preserve the North Fork\u2019s natural state. Yet others are concerned about additional federal protections they see as unnecessary and intrusive.

With an estimated 140,000 attendees and 278 vibrant booths at the Los Angeles Convention Center complex over three unforgettable days, this year\u2019s KCON LA was a true spectacle. From meet-and-greets and mesmerizing workshops to delectable food, a dazzling red carpet, captivating dance showcases and extraordinary live performances, the event had it all. In its 11th year, KCON LA extended its festivities to three action-packed days instead of the usual two. While artists like Stray Kids, ATEEZ, Rain, NCT\u2019s Taeyong, SHINee\u2019s Taemin and SM\u2019s newest sensation, RIIZE, set the Crypto.com Arena ablaze with their showmanship, it was the girl groups who added a charming magic to the mix. Here are eight outstanding girl group moments from KCON LA 2023, because when these ladies took the stage, they devoured the spotlight and left no crumbs behind. 8. Lapillus x EVERGLOW KCON's magnetic allure lies in its ability to seamlessly amalgamate an array of diverse talents onto one electrifying stage. As the curtains rose on the third night's concert, the convergence of MLD Entertainment's beguiling girl group, Lapillus, and Yuehua Entertainment's darling EVERGLOW was a jolting surprise. The two groups joined together in dynamic choreography before Lapillus vaulted into their fervent girl crush anthem \u201cWho\u2019s Next?\u201d With its echoing and boisterous harmonics, the song ignited a fire for the rest of the evening and posed a challenge to the acts to follow. 7.

Their former leader Enrique Tarrio received the longest of them all, 22 years. He prepared the assault over a number of weeks and then orchestrated and encouraged the violence on the day, the court heard. Several other members have also been sent to jail for many years. But how did a group that started as a drinking club seven years ago become one of the main organised groups at the Capitol riot? And in what form will they continue now some of their leaders are behind bars? What next for the group? Shortly before several members were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the Capitol riot, the group's founder Gavin McInnes told the BBC that long prison sentences will make the make the group's leaders into \"martyrs for the cause\", and insisted the group will continue despite its current lack of leadership. \"It's just set in stone and you can't kill it. There's no top, there's no head,\" he said. The defendants \"did something wrong\" by entering the Capitol, but said he believes their actions amounted to relatively minor offences. Unlike some of the other organised groups involved in the Capitol riot which have since ceased operations, local Proud Boy chapters continue to remain active across the country. Expert observers largely agree that the Proud Boys will continue and may even prosper. Samantha Kutner, a researcher who's written about the group and is co-founder of Glitterpill LLC, an anti-extremism consultancy group, says that given the increasing politicisation after the Capitol riots, the convictions may give the Proud Boys a boost. \"It will give them more momentum,\" she says. \"Every time they lose it furthers their martyrdom and persecution complex.\" In an audio interview on Twitter which Tarrio joined via phone from his jail cell just after arguments ended in the court case, the former Proud Boys leader accused authorities of \"weaponising\" the justice system and likened the current US government to the regime in Nazi Germany. \"This is not the end of the Proud Boys,\"\n4. publish date: 2023-09-07, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: A River\u2019s Destiny: The battle for wild and scenic status\nbody: Part One By Jack Igelman, Carolina Public Press August 21, 2023 \u201cA River\u2019s Destiny\u201d is a two-part investigative project reported by Jack Igelman. The project tells the history of the North Fork, how conservationists have long advocated for its special federal protection, and the process to achieve wild and scenic status for its preservation. This is part one of the investigation. As it winds its way through rugged landscapes, diverse ecosystems, and cherished recreational areas, the French Broad River in Western North Carolina is believed to be one of the oldest rivers in the world. Paddlers, conservationists, and other river enthusiasts have long advocated for special federal protection for one of its most beloved tributaries in Transylvania County. But achieving the coveted designation for the North Fork of the French Broad and similar rivers is like navigating a challenging whitewater stream. It involves skillfully maneuvering through government bureaucracy, adding years of study and review to the designation process. This complex and prolonged process requires support from local government, legislation enacted by Congress and the president\u2019s signature. Harrison Metzger of Mills River in Henderson County is perhaps one of the North Fork\u2019s fiercest advocates and is supporting the effort in neighboring Transylvania County to gain federal protection for this whitewater paddling destination within Pisgah National Forest. Not only has he paddled the river dozens of times, but as a local journalist in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the Hendersonville Times-News , he reported on the thwarted effort to dam the North Fork and five other tributaries of the French Broad River. Metzger calls the North Fork a \u201chidden treasure\u201d and views it as a highly accessible creek run in Western North Carolina, treasured for its tight and steep features by whitewater boaters, especially during and after heavy rainfall. Supporters like Metzger have helped generate enthusiasm and support for federal wild and scenic status to preserve the North Fork\u2019s natural state. Yet others are concerned about additional federal protections they see as unnecessary and intrusive. Even though the North Fork has been deemed eligible for\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Wilson, along with support from Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia filed an amicus brief Tuesday to support the appeal of the ruling that the AEA was unconstitutional. In February, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed the Adult Entertainment Act, which bans drag performances and shows in public or where children are present. Offenders could face up to a year in prison and/or a fine of up to $2,500 , and repeat offenders could face prison sentences up to six years. In March, U.S. District Judge Thomas Parker temporarily blocked the law and then ruled it as unconstitutional in June.

On Aug. 27 of this year, the husband, veteran, and father of four died at 49 from pancreatic cancer, his death first announced as an update to an online fundraiser curated by friends of the family. Out of more than 200 known types of the disease that causes cells to grow uncontrollably, pancreatic cancer is one of the most dangerous because it\u2019s difficult to identify in its early stages, when treatment would be most effective. (These will be the deadliest cancers in 2023.) According to a data analysis from the National Program for Cancer Registries database, the rate of early-onset pancreatic cancer \u2013 that which affects those younger than 55 \u2013 is increasing. There\u2019s better news about cancer in general, however: Fewer Americans are dying from it, thanks to factors including advances in treatment, an increase in early detection, and a drop in tobacco use. About 1.95 million Americans across the 50 states are expected to be diagnosed with cancer by the end of this year, and their chances of survival are much higher than they used to be. In the mid-\u201970s the average cancer survival rate beyond five years from diagnosis was 49% \u2013 essentially a coin flip. As of 2018, that rate had risen to 68%. In 1990, 216 out of 100,000 Americans died from cancer. By 2020, the rate was 144.1 \u2013 a 33% decline. The most common forms of the disease are prostate and female breast cancer, which make up between 14% and 22% of all cancer cases nationwide. Prostate cancer, along with thyroid and testis cancers and melanoma, have the highest five-year survival rates \u2013 between 94% and 98%. (The cancer that killed Wurzelbacher? The rate is just 12%.) To identify the states that will have the highest rate of new cancer diagnoses by the end of 2023, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the estimated number of new cancer cases this year from the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Statistics Center.

On Aug. 27 of this year, the husband, veteran, and father of four died at 49 from pancreatic cancer, his death first announced as an update to an online fundraiser curated by friends of the family. Out of more than 200 known types of the disease that causes cells to grow uncontrollably, pancreatic cancer is one of the most dangerous because it\u2019s difficult to identify in its early stages, when treatment would be most effective. (These will be the deadliest cancers in 2023.) According to a data analysis from the National Program for Cancer Registries database, the rate of early-onset pancreatic cancer \u2013 that which affects those younger than 55 \u2013 is increasing. There\u2019s better news about cancer in general, however: Fewer Americans are dying from it, thanks to factors including advances in treatment, an increase in early detection, and a drop in tobacco use. About 1.95 million Americans across the 50 states are expected to be diagnosed with cancer by the end of this year, and their chances of survival are much higher than they used to be. In the mid-\u201970s the average cancer survival rate beyond five years from diagnosis was 49% \u2013 essentially a coin flip. As of 2018, that rate had risen to 68%. In 1990, 216 out of 100,000 Americans died from cancer. By 2020, the rate was 144.1 \u2013 a 33% decline. The most common forms of the disease are prostate and female breast cancer, which make up between 14% and 22% of all cancer cases nationwide. Prostate cancer, along with thyroid and testis cancers and melanoma, have the highest five-year survival rates \u2013 between 94% and 98%. (The cancer that killed Wurzelbacher? The rate is just 12%.) To identify the states that will have the highest rate of new cancer diagnoses by the end of 2023, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the estimated number of new cancer cases this year from the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Statistics Center. Each state\u2019s population and percentage of adults who had health insurance in 2021 came from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey and are 5-year averages.

The 41-year-old officially retired from tennis last year after her third-round loss at the Open. \"Reality is hitting,\" one fan said on grounds on day two of the U.S. Open. \"This is the first year without her - there's just something missing.\" While the mother of two, Serena, has missed the U.S. Open four times since making her debut in 1998, this is the first time fans can no longer look forward to an epic comeback from the 23-time Grand Slam champion. \"It's different, Serena is the GOAT,\" another fan said. \"She is the greatest, so when she's not here it's like 'Ugh,' but we will make the best of it, but we definitely miss her presence.\" Serena's sister, Venus, takes the spotlight tonight on Arthur Ashe Stadium at 7 p.m. as she faces Belgium qualifier Greet Minnen. \"I was very much aware that Serena wouldn't be playing the tournament, \"Venus said when asked about how it is playing without her sister in the draw. \"I've had a chance to get used to that idea even before she retired.

When she told the world in August 2022 she was preparing to close her playing career, Williams cited a desire to grow her family as one of the reasons for stepping away from tennis. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d Williams wrote last year in an essay for Vogue magazine, \u201cI never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.

It is possible that he may be facing legal penalties or fines, but there is no information in the provided sources indicating that he is currently incarcerated.\n\nIt's worth noting that the sources do mention that Giuliani is facing financial difficulties and has been forced to sell his Manhattan apartment to cover his legal bills [6]. Additionally, he has been accused of making false statements and soliciting false testimony, and it is possible that these allegations may be the subject of ongoing legal proceedings [1].\n\nIf you have any further questions or would like more information, you may want to consider asking related questions such as:\n\n* What are the specific charges against Rudy Giuliani related to the 2020 presidential election?\n* What is the status of Giuliani's legal case, and when is his next court appearance?\n* Has Giuliani made any public statements regarding the allegations against him?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, Rudy Giuliani is not currently in jail. However, he is facing legal issues and is seeking financial assistance. Here are the key points:\n\n- Rudy Giuliani is facing a legal battle and is selling his Manhattan apartment for $6.5 million to cover his legal bills related to his work for Donald Trump [1][2][6].\n- In August 2023, he was indicted alongside former President Donald Trump on charges related to the 2020 presidential election. He is accused of making false statements and soliciting false testimony [7].\n- He has declined to elaborate on his financial state, with his lawyers arguing a detailed disclosure would only \u201cembarrass Mr Giuliani and draw attention to his misfortunes\u201d [6].\n- Despite his financial difficulties, Donald Trump has agreed to headline two fundraisers to help Giuliani pay his legal bills. One of these fundraisers will be a very expensive $100,000-per-plate dinner at Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey golf club on Sept. 7 [5].\n\nTo conclude, although Rudy Giuliani has financial and legal issues, he is currently not in jail. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant B provided a more accurate and relevant response to the user's question. While both assistants correctly stated that Rudy Giuliani is not currently in jail, Assistant B did a better job of summarizing the key points from the provided information, including Giuliani's financial difficulties, the charges against him, and the fundraisers being held to help him pay his legal bills. On the other hand, Assistant A violated the rules by suggesting related questions, which is not allowed. Therefore, Assistant B is the better assistant in this case.

COVID-19 has largely been absorbed into school districts' general guidance for respiratory illness for students and staff. Here's what to know. What is the current state of COVID-19 in Maricopa County? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using weekly hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19 as the primary indicators of transmission. In Maricopa County, there has recently been a slight uptick in the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions, which is in line with the national trend, said Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. According to the most recent CDC tracking data , hospital admissions in Maricopa County for the week of July 30 through Aug. 5 were up 19.3 percent from the prior week. Nationally, the change in COVID-19 hospital admissions for that same time period was 14.3 percent. Despite the upward trend, the level of COVID-19 hospital admissions in the county is classified as low by the CDC, meaning there are fewer than 10 admissions per 100,000 people. There were 105 COVID-19 hospital admissions in Maricopa County total that week, according to CDC data. The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is also seeing a slight increase in the number of cases being reported, which is likely due to the new, fast-spreading strain of COVID-19, EG.5, nicknamed \"Eris\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Arizona superintendent Tom Horne to use COVID relief for $40 million tutoring program\nbody: PHOENIX - Arizona is channeling $40 million in federal COVID-19 relief funding toward tutoring students falling behind in school, the state superintendent said Tuesday. Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne announced at a news conference that free tutoring will be available for students who failed to pass proficiency tests in reading, writing and math. The tutoring program, however, will be given on a first-come, first-serve basis. Only students between first and eighth grade at public and charter schools will be eligible. Parents can request it through the state Department of Education website. \"I have one obsession in life. My obsession is that we increase the proficiency levels of the students in the schools and that we help the teachers achieve that,\" Horne said. The funding will cover over one million hours of tutoring for four days a week over a six-week period. Either a certified teacher or a private vendor approved by the state would do the tutoring, according to Horne. Teachers will be paid $30 per hour. If they make sufficient progress in that six-week window, they will get an additional $200 stipend. A teacher who can find the time to tutor could potentially make $8,000 overall. \"This will help the teachers improve their income,\" Horne said. A spokesperson for the Arizona Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers union, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Despite being only 25, the youngster was well-known and considered one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. Following the news of Euphoria actor Angus Cloud\u2019s demise, there were speculations that he might have taken his life. However, two weeks after the tragic news, new details about Cloud\u2019s death have come to light. According to reports, the Hollywood star may have died from an accidental drug overdose. New Findings About Angus Cloud\u2019s Demise Revealed The circumstances surrounding Angus Cloud\u2019s death are yet to be confirmed, but there are reasons to believe the actor may have overdosed. Recall that after the news of Cloud\u2019s passing broke, a statement from the family hinted at suicide as the cause of death. However, a few days later, Cloud\u2019s mother, Lisa, denied the claims, insisting that her son didn\u2019t take his life. According to the grieving mom, she and Cloud spoke over the phone the day before he died, and the promising actor sounded well. Lisa explained that Cloud even talked about the future, helping family members and reorganizing his room. Lisa further explained that she didn\u2019t know what Cloud took after their conversation. However, the young man placed his head on the desk where he was working, fell asleep, and never woke up. She then noted that it was obvious Cloud didn\u2019t want to die, adding that he may have overdosed. A few details after Lisa\u2019s claims, it appears her theory may be validated. According to reports from multiple Law enforcement sources, Euphoria actor Angus Cloud didn\u2019t leave behind a suicide note for loved ones when he died. To them, it is great evidence that Angus Cloud\u2019s death could be due to an accidental overdose and not suicide. However, nothing is confirmed yet as the toxicology results and autopsy are pending. Inside Angus Cloud\u2019s Death On July 31, 2023, the Oakland Fire Department responded to a 911 call from Cloud\u2019s family home for a possible overdose. But sadly, upon arrival, Euphoria actor Angus Cloud was found lifeless in his bedroom in Oakland, California. The following day, the family confirmed the news of Angus Cloud\u2019s death via a statement. They noted that the deceased was an artist, a friend, a brother, a son, and an incredible human. The family also opened up about how Cloud struggled with losing his dad. According to the statement, Cloud battled with his mental health but remained open about it. The family concluded by asking for privacy, adding that they hoped the actor would be remembered for his humor, laughter, and love for everyone.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Editor\u2019s note: Today\u2019s impeachment proceedings have ended and this post will no longer be updated. You can find new articles reporting the latest from Ken Paxton\u2019s trial here. The historic impeachment trial of suspended Attorney General Ken Paxton is underway. He faces 16 articles of impeachment that accuse him of bribery, dereliction of duty and disregard of official duty. Paxton has faced criminal investigations, legal battles and accusations of wrongdoing for years. Still, Texas voters have twice reelected him, most recently in November. Paxton has long positioned himself as one of the country\u2019s strongest conservative attorneys general. In more than two terms as the state\u2019s top lawyer, he has relentlessly sued the federal government over issues from immigration to health care and the environment. Paxton's attorneys argue that the impeachment allegations are baseless or fall under the legitimate duties of the attorney general\u2019s office. The trial is expected to hinge on Paxton\u2019s relationship with a real estate investor and political donor \u2014 and could prominently feature details of an alleged extramarital affair. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick will act as judge. Witnesses will testify under oath, senator-jurors will deliberate privately and votes will be conducted without public debate. The attorney general\u2019s wife, Sen. Angela Paxton, will sit as part of the court, but will not vote or deliberate. Paxton loyalists, but few others, turn out Compared to Ken Paxton\u2019s Impeachment in the House in May, the first day of the Senate trial drew a smaller crowd \u2014 a majority of which included supporters of the now suspended attorney general to show solidarity at the Capitol.

Nearly three years later, the eyes of the nation will be on the Texas Senate on Tuesday as the state's most deliberative body begins examining whether Paxton, one of the most powerful elected officials in the state \u2014 and an ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump's false claims of winning the 2020 presidential election \u2014 should be removed from office. Support from two-thirds of the Senate, or 21 of the participating 30 Senate-jurors, will be required to remove Paxton from office on any one of the 16 articles of impeachment he faces. Ken Paxton impeachment trial live update Follow for the latest The Texas House on May 27 overwhelmingly voted to impeach Paxton, who was immediately suspended from office without pay, after investigators in the lower chamber launched a probe looking into possible transgressions by the state's top lawyer. And though the accusations are not new, it seems House members during the legislative session in the spring took umbrage with being asked by Paxton to have the state cover a $3.3 million settlement with four of the attorney general's former aides who sued the office after they say they were fired for raising their concerns about Paxton with federal authorities. Paxton's defense team has cast the proceeding as a witch hunt, and his supporters are pushing to keep him in office. Defend Texas Liberty PAC, a pro-Paxton political action committee, in June gave $3 million \u2014 a $1 million donation and a $2 million loan \u2014 to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who will preside like a judge over the impeachment trial. Patrick, who is not up for reelection until 2026, on Thursday said he would not accept political contributions during the trial, and the Senate Republican and Democratic caucauses also said they would forgo fundraising.

The far-right Texas Republican machine has swung into action to protect Paxton at all costs. Paxton is only the third state official to ever be impeached in Texas. He was overwhelmingly impeached by the Texas House on charges of abuse of office related to wealthy donor Nate Paul and other related crimes. Paxton, who has never been that friendly with the Texas legislature, has framed the impeachment as a politically motivated witch hunt led by Speaker Dade Phelan. The legal woes of the attorney general are legion. On top of his impeachment, he is finally looking at a court date for the indictment for securities fraud he was handed eight years ago, and the federal government is also looking into his finances. Despite all this, Paxton easily won re-election in 2022. Bribes Because the trial is taking place in the Texas Senate, Texas Senators and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick will be the jury and judge. As the trial starts after the moratorium on political contributions has ended, Interested parties are all legally able to drop money in the campaign accounts of politicians. The money is already rolling in. Patrick received $3 million from the Defend Texas Liberty, bankrolled by long-time Paxton supporters like oil and gas moguls Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks. The PAC has made it very clear that they expect to use their money to move the needle. \u201c\u201dDefend Texas Liberty will ensure that every Republican voter in Texas knows just what a sham the Texas House has been this session and just how absurd this last minute Democrat led impeachment effort is,\u201d the group tweeted in May. Threats Which leads to the threats portion of the discussion. Texas Republicans do not generally have to worry about Democratic challengers.

Why it matters: Regardless of the outcome, the trial will be historic. Paxton is the third state official in Texas history to be impeached, following Gov. James \"Pa\" Ferguson in 1917 and a district judge in 1975. The latest: Paxton's trial is scheduled to start at 9am Tuesday and will be livestreamed by several news outlets, including WFAA and the Dallas Morning News. State of play: The Republican-dominated Texas House voted 121-23 to impeach Paxton on May 27, days before the end of this year's regular legislative session. Votes from two-thirds of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 19-12 majority, will be needed to permanently remove Paxton from office. If he's convicted, senators can also vote to bar him from holding elected office in Texas again. The allegations: Senators will weigh whether Paxton illegally used his office to benefit an Austin real estate developer and improperly fired some of the top deputies who reported him to the FBI and other agencies. The trial will cover 16 of the 20 articles of impeachment against him, which include bribery, obstruction of justice and abuse of public trust. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing. The big picture: The FBI is also investigating Paxton for the alleged misdeeds underpinning his impeachment. A grand jury has reportedly been impaneled to review potential criminal charges. Paxton also faces eight-year-old fraud charges, a whistleblower lawsuit, and a state bar lawsuit over his role in challenging the 2020 election results that could end with his disbarment. Between the lines: State Sen. Angela Paxton, Ken Paxton's wife, is barred from serving as a juror, per rules the Senate adopted in June.

Paxton has faced criminal investigations, legal battles and accusations of wrongdoing for years. Still, Texas voters have twice reelected him, most recently in November. Paxton has long positioned himself as one of the country\u2019s strongest conservative attorneys general. In more than two terms as the state\u2019s top lawyer, he has relentlessly sued the federal government over issues from immigration to health care and the environment. Paxton's attorneys argue that the impeachment allegations are baseless or fall under the legitimate duties of the attorney general\u2019s office. The trial is expected to hinge on Paxton\u2019s relationship with a real estate investor and political donor \u2014 and could prominently feature details of an alleged extramarital affair. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick will act as judge. Witnesses will testify under oath, senator-jurors will deliberate privately and votes will be conducted without public debate. The attorney general\u2019s wife, Sen. Angela Paxton, will sit as part of the court, but will not vote or deliberate. Paxton loyalists, but few others, turn out Compared to Ken Paxton\u2019s Impeachment in the House in May, the first day of the Senate trial drew a smaller crowd \u2014 a majority of which included supporters of the now suspended attorney general to show solidarity at the Capitol. Paxton\u2019s defense has cast the House impeachment as an effort to overturn the will of Texas voters, but Tuesday\u2019s less-than-packed gallery\n2. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Statesman to provide gavel-to-gavel coverage of Paxton impeachment trial\nbody: In October 2020, the American-Statesman broke the news about damning allegations that top aides in Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office made to the FBI against their boss, including accusations that Paxton abused his office and accepted bribes, among other possible crimes. Nearly three years later, the eyes of the nation will be on the Texas Senate on Tuesday as the state's most deliberative body begins examining whether Paxton, one of the most powerful elected officials in the state \u2014 and an ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump's false claims of winning the 2020 presidential election \u2014 should be removed from office. Support from two-thirds of the Senate, or 21 of the participating 30 Senate-jurors, will be required to remove Paxton from office on any one of the 16 articles of impeachment he faces. Ken Paxton impeachment trial live update Follow for the latest The Texas House on May 27 overwhelmingly voted to impeach Paxton, who was immediately suspended from office without pay, after investigators in the lower chamber launched a probe looking into possible transgressions by the state's top lawyer. And though the accusations are not new, it seems House members during the legislative session in the spring took umbrage with being asked by Paxton to have the state cover a $3.3 million settlement with four of the attorney general's former aides who sued the office after they say they were fired for raising their concerns about Paxton with federal authorities. Paxton's defense team has cast the proceeding as a witch hunt, and his supporters are pushing to keep him in office. Defend Texas Liberty PAC, a pro-Paxton political action committee, in June gave $3 million \u2014 a $1 million donation and a $2 million loan \u2014 to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who will preside like a judge over the impeachment trial. Patrick, who is not up for reelection until 2026, on Thursday said he would not accept political contributions during the trial, and the Senate Republican and Democratic caucauses also said they would forgo fundraising.

The far-right Texas Republican machine has swung into action to protect Paxton at all costs. Paxton is only the third state official to ever be impeached in Texas. He was overwhelmingly impeached by the Texas House on charges of abuse of office related to wealthy donor Nate Paul and other related crimes. Paxton, who has never been that friendly with the Texas legislature, has framed the impeachment as a politically motivated witch hunt led by Speaker Dade Phelan. The legal woes of the attorney general are legion. On top of his impeachment, he is finally looking at a court date for the indictment for securities fraud he was handed eight years ago, and the federal government is also looking into his finances. Despite all this, Paxton easily won re-election in 2022. Bribes Because the trial is taking place in the Texas Senate, Texas Senators and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick will be the jury and judge. As the trial starts after the moratorium on political contributions has ended, Interested parties are all legally able to drop money in the campaign accounts of politicians. The money is already rolling in. Patrick received $3 million from the Defend Texas Liberty, bankrolled by long-time Paxton supporters like oil and gas moguls Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks. The PAC has made it very clear that they expect to use their money to move the needle. \u201c\u201dDefend Texas Liberty will ensure that every Republican voter in Texas knows just what a sham the Texas House has been this session and just how absurd this last minute Democrat led impeachment effort is,\u201d the group tweeted in May. Threats Which leads to the threats portion of the discussion. Texas Republicans do not generally have to worry about Democratic challengers. The primary is where the real battle is fought, and over the last several cycles that fight has become vicious.

Why it matters: Regardless of the outcome, the trial will be historic. Paxton is the third state official in Texas history to be impeached, following Gov. James \"Pa\" Ferguson in 1917 and a district judge in 1975. The latest: Paxton's trial is scheduled to start at 9am Tuesday and will be livestreamed by several news outlets, including WFAA and the Dallas Morning News. State of play: The Republican-dominated Texas House voted 121-23 to impeach Paxton on May 27, days before the end of this year's regular legislative session. Votes from two-thirds of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 19-12 majority, will be needed to permanently remove Paxton from office. If he's convicted, senators can also vote to bar him from holding elected office in Texas again. The allegations: Senators will weigh whether Paxton illegally used his office to benefit an Austin real estate developer and improperly fired some of the top deputies who reported him to the FBI and other agencies. The trial will cover 16 of the 20 articles of impeachment against him, which include bribery, obstruction of justice and abuse of public trust. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing. The big picture: The FBI is also investigating Paxton for the alleged misdeeds underpinning his impeachment. A grand jury has reportedly been impaneled to review potential criminal charges. Paxton also faces eight-year-old fraud charges, a whistleblower lawsuit, and a state bar lawsuit over his role in challenging the 2020 election results that could end with his disbarment. Between the lines: State Sen. Angela Paxton, Ken Paxton's wife, is barred from serving as a juror, per rules the Senate adopted in June. Ken Paxton's lawyers removed her from a witness list, the Austin American-Statesman reported last week. Her absence\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

In less than a day after launching NASA's Crew 7 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), SpaceX flew its Falcon 9 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The launch was SpaceX's 59th for 2023 and its 258th overall mission, indicating that it is unlikely that the firm will meet its self-set target of launching 100 rockets this year. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket was already vertical on the pad yesterday at the time of the Crew 7 launch, and if the company is to launch 100 missions this year, then it will have to launch one more mission this year and at least ten missions per month for the remainder of 2023. SpaceX Has Launch Nearly As Many Launches In 2023 So Far As It Did In Full Year 2022 Even though SpaceX might not launch 100 missions this year, the firm has grown its launch cadence this year compared to the last. In 2022, the company had launched 61 missions, and with potentially two more launches left before August closes, it appears that SpaceX will have met its 2022 cadence by the end of this month. A large portion of SpaceX's launch manifest is made of Starlink launches, and recent trends indicate that the firm will have to step up the pace of these launches, too. This is because the number of satellites that SpaceX launches with each mission has rapidly dropped since the firm finished building out the first generation portion of its constellation.

His defense claims that the young men were killed as a result of a drive-by shooting, however, prosecutors believe he shot them from within the vehicle. If he\u2019s convicted, he could be facing the death penalty. In July, jurors were unable to come to a unanimous decision as to whether or not he\u2019s guilty, leading the judge to rule a mistrial . Now, one of the jurors from the first trial has come forward, making some serious claims about the case. The anonymous juror has alleged that Melly was framed for double murder. \u201cI believe that he didn\u2019t do it and it wasn\u2019t proved in court,\u201d they explained. \u201c This was a really bad situation of being framed. \u201d The former juror further claims that \u201cMelly was a very good person,\u201d adding that he \u201calways tried to help out people around him.\u201d Read More: YNW Melly Trial: Motion Filed Against Lead Detective Amid Excessive Force Investigation Juror Says \u201cMelly Was A Very Good Person\u201d At the beginning of last month, a former juror also said that jury manipulation is what led to the mistrial.

(WWLP) \u2013 A recent genetic study of Lyme disease offers greater insight into some of the long-lasting symptoms seen in people. UV Index: Staying protected this Labor Day weekend Nearly half a million people are infected with the Lyme bacteria each year, according to the CDC. Samples from hundreds of patients revealed that certain strains of the Lyme bacteria have a protective outer layer that contains a type of protein that appears to function as armor against the human immune system. This in turn gives the bacteria a better chance of spreading throughout the body. The researchers hoped to learn how certain strains of the Lyme bacteria were able to spread beyond the initial bite site. This new research allows us to better understand why certain long-standing symptoms like body aches and pains arthritis and even memory complaints persist. It also allows scientists to create new treatment options for those dealing with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The new research is at a very early stage, but it is an important step to understanding and treating the disease. Scientists hope to conduct a larger study that follows people over a longer amount of time to learn which patients go on to develop those long-standing symptoms.

Our information page, Coronavirus in New York City , began in the bewildering early weeks of the crisis. Readers quickly came to rely on it to see how the virus was moving across the five boroughs. Over time, we added other metrics, including the number of COVID patients in hospital intensive care units, and numbers of vaccine and booster shots. But the pandemic has changed, and so has the available data on it. New York state, for example, reports positive COVID tests from clinical settings only \u2014 leaving out the vast number of positive results from tests conducted at home. Meanwhile, independent efforts to track COVID from organizations like the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and The New York Times ceased earlier this year. That leaves the federal Centers for Disease Control\u2019s COVID Data Tracker . At THE CITY, we still see the need for a New York City-specific view of the pandemic , but the granular view presented in earlier versions of the tracker is no longer reliable. So we\u2019re updating the tracker once again to align it with the most accurate and useful information available.

(WWLP) \u2013 A recent genetic study of Lyme disease offers greater insight into some of the long-lasting symptoms seen in people. UV Index: Staying protected this Labor Day weekend Nearly half a million people are infected with the Lyme bacteria each year, according to the CDC. Samples from hundreds of patients revealed that certain strains of the Lyme bacteria have a protective outer layer that contains a type of protein that appears to function as armor against the human immune system. This in turn gives the bacteria a better chance of spreading throughout the body. The researchers hoped to learn how certain strains of the Lyme bacteria were able to spread beyond the initial bite site. This new research allows us to better understand why certain long-standing symptoms like body aches and pains arthritis and even memory complaints persist. It also allows scientists to create new treatment options for those dealing with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The new research is at a very early stage, but it is an important step to understanding and treating the disease.

To reduce mosquito activity and the risk of West Nile virus, trucks will spray pesticides in sections of Brooklyn beginning on Thursday, August 31, 2023 between the hours of 8:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. the following morning. The Health Department will be using very low concentrations of Anvil 10+10, Duet or MERUS 3.0. The risks of pesticides applied by the Health Department for mosquito control are low to both people and pets. Some people who are sensitive to spray ingredients may experience short-term eye or throat irritation, or a rash. People with respiratory conditions may also be temporarily affected. In case of bad weather, the Health Department will delay application until Tuesday, September 5, 2023. In order to stay safe during spraying, the Health Department recommends residents to stay indoors, whenever possible. Air conditioners can remain on.

Our information page, Coronavirus in New York City , began in the bewildering early weeks of the crisis. Readers quickly came to rely on it to see how the virus was moving across the five boroughs. Over time, we added other metrics, including the number of COVID patients in hospital intensive care units, and numbers of vaccine and booster shots. But the pandemic has changed, and so has the available data on it. New York state, for example, reports positive COVID tests from clinical settings only \u2014 leaving out the vast number of positive results from tests conducted at home. Meanwhile, independent efforts to track COVID from organizations like the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and The New York Times ceased earlier this year. That leaves the federal Centers for Disease Control\u2019s COVID Data Tracker . At THE CITY, we still see the need for a New York City-specific view of the pandemic , but the granular view presented in earlier versions of the tracker is no longer reliable. So we\u2019re updating the tracker once again to align it with the most accurate and useful information available.

The remarks came a day after bloody protests by rival groups of Eritreans in south Tel Aviv left dozens of people injured. Eritreans, supporters and opponents of Eritrea\u2019s government, faced off with construction lumber, pieces of metal and rocks, smashing shop windows and police cars. Israeli police in riot gear shot tear gas, stun grenades and live rounds while officers on horseback tried to control the protesters.

Israel is on the migrant route from Africa to Europe. Many of the migrants who make it to Israel don\u2019t actually leave. Parts of Tel Aviv have been taken over by migrants and gangs who have their own no-go zones. Why don\u2019t you know about it? Because nobody wants to talk about it. The media generally isn\u2019t interested in covering it except when it occasionally reports on pro-migrant leftist protests, and the pro-Israel camp tends to repeat the stuff that the establishment puts out, which is ignoring the problem. The people suffering from the massive illegal alien migrant population are the ones living in poorer parts of Tel Aviv. The situation has been bad for a long time. Israel\u2019s new conservative government in part came into office on a promise to finally start deporting the illegals.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he would pursue \u201charsh measures against the rioters, including the immediate deportation of those that took part\u201d. The UN\u2019s refugee agency on Tuesday warned Israel\u2019s government that mass deportations could \u201ccontravene international law\u201d. \u201cUNHCR calls for calm and restraint, and on all parties to refrain from taking any steps that could aggravate the situation further,\u201d the agency's spokesman William Spindler said.

The remarks came a day after bloody protests by rival groups of Eritreans in south Tel Aviv left dozens of people injured. Eritreans, supporters and opponents of Eritrea\u2019s government, faced off with construction lumber, pieces of metal and rocks, smashing shop windows and police cars. Israeli police in riot gear shot tear gas, stun grenades and live rounds while officers on horseback tried to control the protesters. The violence on Saturday returned to the fore the issue of migrants, which has long divided Israel. Its resurgence comes as Israel is torn over Netanyahu\u2019s judicial overhaul plan, and supporters cite the migrant issue as a reason why the courts should be reined in, saying they have stood in the way of pushing the migrants out. \u201cWe want harsh measures against the rioters, including the immediate deportation of those who took part,\u201d Netanyahu said in a special ministerial\n5. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Eritreans in Tel Aviv unsure if they fear Netanyahu or other Eritreans more\nbody: Tel Aviv, Israel \u2013 Halefom Sultan, an Eritrean refugee in Israel living in the diverse central Tel Aviv neighbourhood of Neve Sha\u2019anan, says he is afraid to venture out of his house at night out of fear of violent retribution from pro-regime Eritreans.

Israel is on the migrant route from Africa to Europe. Many of the migrants who make it to Israel don\u2019t actually leave. Parts of Tel Aviv have been taken over by migrants and gangs who have their own no-go zones. Why don\u2019t you know about it? Because nobody wants to talk about it. The media generally isn\u2019t interested in covering it except when it occasionally reports on pro-migrant leftist protests, and the pro-Israel camp tends to repeat the stuff that the establishment puts out, which is ignoring the problem. The people suffering from the massive illegal alien migrant population are the ones living in poorer parts of Tel Aviv. The situation has been bad for a long time. Israel\u2019s new conservative government in part came into office on a promise to finally start deporting the illegals. Unfortunately Israel\u2019s leftist judiciary, especially its Supreme Court, has blocked such efforts. House Democrats also pressured Israel to drop any plan to deport the migrant population. And this was a government plan to hand the migrants $3,500 and buy them plane tickets. Now the whole thing has exploded in a way that no one could ignore with riots in the \u201cnic\n7. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: Israel weighs deporting Eritrean migrants after riots\nbody: Articles: https://www.i24news.tv/en Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/i24newsEN/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/i24NEWS_EN Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/i24news/ #i24NEWS #IsraelBusinessBeat Israel Business Beat is a magazine program bringing you an insider\u2019s look into the latest break-throughs out of the \u2018Start Up Nation\u2019.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman, William Spindler, stated that any decision impacting all Eritrean asylum-seekers or instances of refoulment would be in violation of international law [1].\n\nFurthermore, the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has ordered a plan to remove all African migrants from the occupied territories, which has been met with opposition from the judiciary and human rights groups [2]. The UN has urged Israel not to undertake wide-scale deportations of Eritreans, as it could aggravate the situation and violate international law [3].\n\nHowever, due to the lack of information on the current status of Eritrean mass migration through Israel, I cannot provide a more detailed answer. It is important to note that the information provided is limited to the specified dates and sources, and there may be other relevant information available beyond the given sources.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, the issue of Eritrean mass migration through Israel is currently a hot topic. Here are the key points:\n\n- The United Nations (UN) has expressed concern over the mass deportation of Eritreans by the Israeli government, stating that such actions would contravene international law. The UN has warned that collective punishment or returning a person to a country where they could face cruel, inhumane, or degrading punishment or treatment is banned under international law [1][2].\n- The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has called for calm and restraint on all parties involved in this issue. The agency has requested that the Israeli government refrain from any mass deportations [1][2].\n- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the immediate deportation of Eritrean migrants involved in a violent clash in Tel Aviv. He has also ordered plans to remove all African migrants from the occupied territories [1][2][4].\n- Tensions between the Israeli government and the judiciary are rising over this issue. The judiciary has previously overturned efforts to clamp down on illegal migration and limit the number of asylum seekers [2][4].\n- The Prime Minister's right-wing coalition is currently trying to pass a radical overhaul of the judiciary, which has been seen as a direct response to the judiciary's rulings on this issue [2][4].\n- Eritrean refugees in Israel are fearful of being deported. Some are torn between fearing the calls to deport Eritrean asylum seekers and the violence from pro-regime Eritreans [5].\n\nPlease let me know if you need more specific information on this topic. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question about Eritrean mass migration through Israel.

In return, experts said, North Korea will likely want food and energy shipments and transfers of sophisticated weapons technologies. A meeting with Putin would be Kim\u2019s first summit with a foreign leader since North Korea closed its borders in January 2020. They met for the first time in April 2019, two months after Kim\u2019s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with then-U.S. President Donald Trump collapsed. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to Pyongyang in July and asked Kim to send more ammunition to Russia, according to U.S. officials. Shoigu said Moscow and Pyongyang were considering holding military exercises for the first time. It\u2019s unclear how far Kim and Putin\u2019s military cooperation could go, but any sign of warming relations will worry rivals like the U.S. and South Korea.

Along Italy\u2019s northern Adriatic coast and in Tuscan fish farms workers were pulling up their nets and finding them chewed to threads. Then they began discovering eels with missing heads and harvested clams and mussels with their meat already devoured. The culprit, which now threatens millions of euros worth of annual profits in shellfish, is the Atlantic blue crab, first introduced in the bilge water of foreign merchant and cruise ships several years ago. In just a few years, the foreign critters, which can produce two million eggs a year and hold no natural predators in Italy, have reproduced quickly, wiping out the entire clam and mussel harvest for some fishermen. Agricultural industry group FedagriPesca estimates that more than half the nation\u2019s clams and mussels were eaten by the blue crab this summer. Culinary solution Initially, the government recommended catching and destroying the crabs, which are delicacies in other parts of the world. And it didn\u2019t take long for some fishermen, their nets laden with the tiny beasts, to monetize the mayhem. Now Italians are turning the killer crustaceans into a culinary delicacy, introducing them into risotto, pasta dishes and even salads.

Where we spend hundreds of dollars on our time-honored crab feasts, the Italian fishing community sees these crabs as the enemy. They are eating up young clams and mussels, key fisheries for the country\u2019s seafood industry. As Bay Bulletin first reported in 2019, scientists believe blue crabs made their way to the Mediterranean in the ballast water of ships, scooped up in North America and released into the water overseas. The crabs were first detected in the Ebro Delta in Spain in 2012. They\u2019ve since been spreading via sea, rivers and wetlands, multiplying even as scientists attempted to study their migration patterns. In Spain, the crabs\u2019 claws were damaging fishing nets. But for Italy, there\u2019s a lot more at stake than damaged fishing nets. The fishermens\u2019 association Fedagripesca-Confcooperative reports that the crabs have already eaten up nearly 90 percent of young clams and cost Italy about \u20ac100m ($107.2 million U.S.). Italy is Europe\u2019s largest clam producer and the third largest in the world (after China and South Korea). In the meantime, government leaders are advising fishermen to catch as many blue crabs as possible to try to curb the population. But it may not be enough. Fedagripesca-Confcooperative says 326 tons of blue crabs have been caught in Veneto so far this year. One Italian man with ties to Maryland\u2014and a strong love of crab feasts\u2014wants to get his family and friends on board with picking blue crabs. Cesare Barban, 34, is an IT manager in the northeast Italy province of Treviso, about an hour from Venice and the Adriatic shore that is currently plagued by crabs. When he was in college, Barban tells us, he had an American girlfriend who was from Maryland. He spent a few months living with her family in the Westminster area, experiencing \u201cthe real Maryland lifestyle\u201d, as he puts it. \u201cDays filled with crab-based cuisine, boat sailing in the Chesapeake Bay, baseball games, countryside horse riding, picking the Halloween pumpkins right off the pumpkin patch, Baltimore Aquarium, food, food, food\u2026it was all a blast!\u201d Barban also fell in love with Old Bay and J.O.

Here in Hampton Roads, blue crabs are the most iconic species in the Chesapeake Bay, propelling commercial fishing into a $30 million industry every year. If you travel north to Maryland, they\u2019re more than just a food resource - but a sense of state pride and tradition. That is why it\u2019s hard to grasp that, 4,000 miles away in Europe, the blue crab is becoming public enemy number one. In the waters off the coast of Italy, clams reign supreme, and an unexpected surge in our beloved blue crab is decimating the population of Italians\u2019 favorite seafood. Fishermen, lobbying groups and environmentalists have sounded the alarm about the risks from a summer surge in the population of the fast-reproducing invasive species. The crabs are devouring stocks of eels, clams and mussels and wreaking havoc on fishing nets. According to the Associated Press, 50% of clams, mussels, and oysters have been damaged by the blue crab, which reproduces fast and has no natural predators. Italy is the largest producer of clams in Europe and the third largest in the world after China and South Korea, according to U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization data from 2021. Once considered rare in Europe, environmentalists with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation believe warmer waters due to climate change may have brought on the increase in population. The problem has become so bad that the Italian government has allocated 2.9 million euros, about $3 million, to fight the invasion. Some fishing associations and restaurants overseas are embracing this new way of life, though, hoping to introduce Italians and their palates to the beloved American staple. Ironically, here at home, the blue crab population has struggled over the last decade. However, the number of blue crabs living in the Chesapeake Bay is showing improvement after reaching record lows in 2022, a survey conducted jointly by Virginia and Maryland found. The 2023 Blue Crab Winter Dredge Survey put the estimated total crab abundance at 323 million, compared to the 227 million estimated in 2022, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) said.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Along Italy\u2019s northern Adriatic coast and in Tuscan fish farms workers were pulling up their nets and finding them chewed to threads. Then they began discovering eels with missing heads and harvested clams and mussels with their meat already devoured. The culprit, which now threatens millions of euros worth of annual profits in shellfish, is the Atlantic blue crab, first introduced in the bilge water of foreign merchant and cruise ships several years ago. In just a few years, the foreign critters, which can produce two million eggs a year and hold no natural predators in Italy, have reproduced quickly, wiping out the entire clam and mussel harvest for some fishermen. Agricultural industry group FedagriPesca estimates that more than half the nation\u2019s clams and mussels were eaten by the blue crab this summer. Culinary solution Initially, the government recommended catching and destroying the crabs, which are delicacies in other parts of the world. And it didn\u2019t take long for some fishermen, their nets laden with the tiny beasts, to monetize the mayhem.

The judges are considering whether the map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and needs to be redrawn. The Supreme Court has affirmed a lower court ruling that any remedial map must have two majority Black districts or \"something quite close to it.\"\n\nAccording to [1], the judges sharply questioned state lawmakers about creating a second-majority Black district during the review. This suggests that the judges are taking the issue seriously and are carefully considering the map's compliance with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide more information on the current status of the map's review, as the most recent information available is from August 15th, and there have been no further updates since then. However, I recommend keeping an eye on local news sources, such as News 19, for the latest developments on this issue.\n\nAdditionally, some related questions you may be interested in asking include:\n\n1. What are the specific concerns regarding Alabama's congressional map?\n2. How does the new map compare to the previous one in terms of representation for minority communities?\n3. What are the potential implications of the map's approval or rejection for Alabama's political landscape?\n\nPlease note that these questions are not based on the provided information and are purely suggestions for further exploration.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nYes, Alabama's congressional maps have been redrawn. Here are the key points from the information I found:\n\n- A panel of three federal judges is currently reviewing Alabama's newly drawn congressional map[1][3].\n- Closing arguments have been completed in the case over Alabama's new congressional map[2][3].\n- The Supreme Court in June affirmed a lower court ruling that said any remedial map will need two majority Black districts or \u201csomething quite close to it\u201d[3].\n- The federal judges are questioning if state lawmakers ignored the court\u2019s directive to create a second-majority Black district[4].\n\nPlease note that the decision on whether the new congressional map is valid or needs to be redrawn is still pending. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question about Alabama's redrawn congressional maps.

In what would be his first foreign travel since the start of the pandemic, Kim may visit Russia this month for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a U.S. official has said, possibly to discuss North Korean arms sales to refill Russian reserves drained by its war on Ukraine. According to U.S. reports, the two leaders could meet in the eastern city of Vladivostok, the site of their first get-together in April 2019, when Kim took his green-and-yellow train. Putin is expected in the city for the annual Eastern Economic Forum that runs from Sunday to Wednesday. The reports come at a time when the leaders' interests are aligning in the face of their deepening, separate confrontations with the United States. Whether Kim could again make the rattling 20-hour journey by rail is a focus of media attention, as is the reportedly luxurious train, which stands in sharp contrast to the grinding poverty of daily life for most North Koreans. Kim\u2019s famously flight-averse father, Kim Jong Il, made about a dozen trips abroad during his 17-year rule, almost all to China and all by train. North Korea\u2019s state media said that the elder Kim died of a heart attack during a train trip in 2011. According to an account published in 2002 by Konstantin Pulikovsky, a Russian official who accompanied Kim Jong ll on a three-week trip to Moscow, the train carried cases of expensive French wine and passengers could feast on fresh lobster and pork barbeque.

But Rader gradually faded from view after his 2005 arrest, as he served one life term for each of the 10 people he was convicted of killing. He made headlines again this week, though, because he was named the prime suspect in an Oklahoma teen\u2019s 1976 disappearance and a Missouri woman\u2019s 1990 killing.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-02, Saturday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Law enforcement seeks help to identify barns in BTK serial killer cold case investigations\nbody: (CNN) \u2014 A law enforcement team in northeast Oklahoma believes the prolific serial killer known as \u201cBTK\u201d may be responsible for several additional unsolved missing person and homicide cases. Now they\u2019re hoping the public can help them identify barns and silos in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri that the self-proclaimed BTK killer Dennis Rader sketched in never-before-seen detailed drawings. Last month, the Osage County Sheriff\u2019s Office publicly confirmed it was investigating Rader as the \u201cprime suspect\u201d in a 1976 cold case in their jurisdiction and several other unsolved crimes across three states. The investigators believe the killer may have buried 16-year-old Cynthia Dawn Kinney in a barn near the Kansas-Oklahoma border. Kinney was last seen at a laundromat in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, in 1976. Her body has never been found. CNN obtained images of Rader\u2019s drawings, which were first recovered by law enforcement after his arrest in 2005. Rader pleaded guilty to 10 murders that took place from the 1970s to the 1990s in Wichita, Kansas, for which he\u2019s serving 10 consecutive life sentences in a state prison. He suggested in a letter found long before his capture that he should be called \u201cBTK,\u201d short for \u201cbind, torture, kill.\u201d In recent prison interviews, Rader told Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden and other local area authorities he did not commit any other murders.

Never-before seen drawings from BTK, showing barns and silos in the backgrounds of torture scenes, may hold the key to identifying the cases that involve a missing person and other homicides, CNN reports. BTK \u2014 whose real name is Dennis Rader \u2014 is under investigation in the 1976 disappearance of 16-year-old Cynthia Dawn Kinney and several other unsolved cases, said the Osage County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Kinney was last seen in 1976 at a laundromat in Pawkhuska, a northern Oklahoma town. Law enforcement is asking the public to help identify the barns and silos in areas across Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri possibly involved in Kinney\u2019s disappearance and BTK\u2019s other crimes . Rader says the 10 homicides in the Wichita, Kan. area which he\u2019s admitted committing from the 1970s to the 1990s are all the only ones he was involved in. He\u2019s serving 10 consecutive life sentences in those cases, and his earliest release date is in 2180. But Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden \u2014 who has recently interviewed Rader \u2014 hopes that the trove of sketches, which authorities obtained after his 2005 arrest, will help prove otherwise.

Since the Osage County Sheriff's Office began looking into potential connections between Rader and Cynthia Dawn Kinney, a 16-year-old Pawhuska girl who vanished from her aunt and uncle's laundromat in 1976, detectives have unearthed tips, leads and new evidence.

Here's why and some background about his case\nbody: Dennis Rader, the BTK serial killer whose self-given nickname stands for \u201cBind, Torture, Kill,\u201d played a cat and mouse game with investigators and reporters for decades before he was caught. But Rader gradually faded from view after his 2005 arrest, as he served one life term for each of the 10 people he was convicted of killing. He made headlines again this week, though, because he was named the prime suspect in an Oklahoma teen\u2019s 1976 disappearance and a Missouri woman\u2019s 1990 killing.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-02, Saturday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Law enforcement seeks help to identify barns in BTK serial killer cold case investigations\nbody: (CNN) \u2014 A law enforcement team in northeast Oklahoma believes the prolific serial killer known as \u201cBTK\u201d may be responsible for several additional unsolved missing person and homicide cases. Now they\u2019re hoping the public can help them identify barns and silos in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri that the self-proclaimed BTK killer Dennis Rader sketched in never-before-seen detailed drawings. Last month, the Osage County Sheriff\u2019s Office publicly confirmed it was investigating Rader as the \u201cprime suspect\u201d in a 1976 cold case in their jurisdiction and several other unsolved crimes across three states. The investigators believe the killer may have buried 16-year-old Cynthia Dawn Kinney in a barn near the Kansas-Oklahoma border. Kinney was last seen at a laundromat in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, in 1976. Her body has never been found. CNN obtained images of Rader\u2019s drawings, which were first recovered by law enforcement after his arrest in 2005. Rader pleaded guilty to 10 murders that took place from the 1970s to the 1990s in Wichita, Kansas, for which he\u2019s serving 10 consecutive life sentences in a state prison. He suggested in a letter found long before his capture that he should be called \u201cBTK,\u201d short for \u201cbind, torture, kill.\u201d In recent prison interviews, Rader told Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden and other local area authorities he did not commit any other murders. An attorney for the serial killer declined to comment to CNN.

Never-before seen drawings from BTK, showing barns and silos in the backgrounds of torture scenes, may hold the key to identifying the cases that involve a missing person and other homicides, CNN reports. BTK \u2014 whose real name is Dennis Rader \u2014 is under investigation in the 1976 disappearance of 16-year-old Cynthia Dawn Kinney and several other unsolved cases, said the Osage County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Kinney was last seen in 1976 at a laundromat in Pawkhuska, a northern Oklahoma town. Law enforcement is asking the public to help identify the barns and silos in areas across Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri possibly involved in Kinney\u2019s disappearance and BTK\u2019s other crimes . Rader says the 10 homicides in the Wichita, Kan. area which he\u2019s admitted committing from the 1970s to the 1990s are all the only ones he was involved in. He\u2019s serving 10 consecutive life sentences in those cases, and his earliest release date is in 2180. But Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden \u2014 who has recently interviewed Rader \u2014 hopes that the trove of sketches, which authorities obtained after his 2005 arrest, will help prove otherwise. The drawings obtained by CNN show several of Rader\u2019s victims. Authorities also say that recent communication was intercepted from Rader leads them to believe there may be some hidden items in old barns.

Been there, done that. What she hasn't experienced is winning a major championship. So her first trip to the semifinals at the U.S. Open does not leave her satisfied at all, no matter how dominant the performance was that got her to that stage. \u201cThe dreams never came with the people in the stands and autographs. That was never in the dreams,\u201d the 19-year-old from Florida said. \u201cIt was just, like, the trophy.\u201d That hardware is getting closer. Gauff dealt just fine with the heat, the humidity and a big-hitting opponent to defeat Jelena Ostapenko 6-0, 6-2 on Tuesday, becoming the first American teenager to reach the final four at Flushing Meadows since Serena Williams in 2001. \u201cEven though (by) the semifinals, (in) theory, if you want to win, there\u2019s two matches left, you can\u2019t think like that,\u201d the sixth-seeded Gauff said. \u201cI\u2019m still in the mindset that I\u2019m in the beginning of the tournament. That's what I have learned in the past (from) being in quarterfinals: Before, I would think, \u2018Close to the end.\u2019 But right now, I have the mentality that I told myself, \u2018I still have another two weeks to play.\u2019 So that\u2019s where my mind is at.

AFP spoke on the eve of its release to the three co-chairs of the report, approved last week in Berlin by the 143 member nations of IPBES, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The co-chairs are ecologist Helen Roy, a professor at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; Peter Stoett, dean of Social Sciences and Humanities at Ontario Tech University; and Anibal Pauchard, a professor at the University of Concepcion in Chile. The following has been condensed and edited for clarity. Q. You conclude that the number of invasive species is rising at an \"unprecedented rate\". Can you quantify that? Roy: The problem is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. On current \"business-as-usual\" trends, we anticipate an increase of 36 percent by 2050.

This summer, a disease swept through and killed a large number of mammals in Southern California. Marine experts say what\u2019s happening here is different than the tragedy in Southern California, but nonetheless disheartening and comes with a warning. \u201cThis particular disease, Leptospirosis, is spread through urine,\u201d explained Sue Pemberton with the California Academy of Sciences.

It is one of nearly a dozen that have washed ashore in the last few weeks here. \u201cWe want to hear from people,\u201d explained Pemberton. She helps coordinate response teams who perform necropsies on dead sea life, including sea lions. Although the teams have not been out to Doran Beach, they have responded to other washed-up carcasses in San Mateo County. Pemberton advises keeping your distance if you see a dead sea lion on the shore. Leptospirosis can spread to other animals such as dogs.

The adult male, estimated be about 400 pounds, was first spotted on Hollywood Beach, 50 miles northwest of Santa Monica, by the Channel Islands Harbor Patrol at 7:20 a.m., before it went into the water and swam to a dock near Channel Islands Harbor public boat launch ramp, according to a news release issued by the institute on Tuesday. At the harbor, the volunteer removed the knife from the animal\u2019s face using a pole with a hook-blade attached to the end. The volunteer managed to get the hook in the rope-cutter slot on the knife\u2019s handle \u2014 pulling the hook-blade straight, then pressing slightly upward, to avoid further injuring the sea lion while removing the knife.

The massive mammal, weighing about 400 pounds, was first spotted around 7:20 a.m. Sunday at Hollywood Beach but swam over to the boat launch ramp, the Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute posted on Facebook . A CIMWI volunteer was able to safely remove the knife, which was embedded up to its handle, from the face of the adult California sea lion, the post read. The volunteer used a pole with a hook blade and managed to catch the belt cutter slot on the knife and pulled it out. \u201cThankfully, the knife missed all vital structures of the sea lion\u2019s face and the wound will heal on its own,\u201d officials said. The male sea lion then jumped off the dock and swam around until it hopped up on a nearby dock finger to sun himself. \u201cThis sea lion now has a second chance at life,\u201d officials said.

At 82 he is older than President Biden or Mitch McConnell, but he moves around and thinks as clearly as a man 20 years younger. He is smart, glib, telegenic, and an accomplished con man. Well, a con man may be a bit harsh. Perhaps I should say politician, although he is a better and smoother liar than most politicians because he can draw on the reserve of credibility that comes from wearing a white coat and claiming the mantle of science. As Jazz wrote yesterday, Fauci is back on the COVIDmania tour, pushing his debunked narrative that the policies he pushed during the height of the pandemic will really work this time, even though they proved completely worthless in stopping the spread of COVID and absolutely disastrous to the economic and social health of the country. He made the mistake of showing up on the normally friendly CNN to promote hysteria and in particular mask mandates yet again, and this time he got some serious pushback from Michael Smerconish. It\u2019s about time. At issue was the Cochrane Review meta-analysis of mask studies, which conclusively demonstrated that population-level mask mandates don\u2019t work to slow or stop the spread of COVID (or the flu).

The former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 82, was branded as the nation's Covid czar because he sternly recommended wearing face coverings and social distancing in public. As early as April 2020 , he told fearful Americans: 'If everybody does that, we\u2019re each protecting each other. Because the data is, it's more efficient to prevent transmitting to others than it is to prevent transmission to yourself.' People had to wear masks in schools, public transportation, restaurants, and workplaces. But following a series of leaked emails and interviews since the height of the pandemic, Fauci has been criticized for flip-flopping in his beliefs as he admitted there is a lack of evidence to suggest they worked in halting the spread of the virus.

He expressed concern that people may not abide by recommendations to wear masks if masking recommendations were to return. He also called into question a Cochrane study that found masking to be ineffective, stating that while it didn't slow down the pandemic, there is evidence that on an individual basis, many people protect themselves with masks. This has drawn criticism from others, with some calling his claims misleading.

In the event that masks are again recommended, he is \"concerned that people will not abide by recommendations,\" he said in the interview. \"I would hope that if we get to the point that the volume of cases is such and organizations like the CDC recommends \u2013 CDC does not mandate anything \u2013 recommends that people wear masks, I would hope that people abide by that recommendation and take into account the risks to themselves and their families,\" Fauci told CNN. Fauci, who also served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health until December 2022, also called into question a January 2023 Cochrane study that found masking to be ineffective. \"When you\u2019re talking about the effect on the pandemic as a whole, the data is less strong,\" Fauci said. \"But when you talk about an individual basis of someone protecting themselves \u2026 there\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s many studies that show that there is an advantage [to masks].\" The Cochrane study, led by 12 researchers from esteemed universities around the world, compared the use of medical/surgical masks to wearing no masks.

However, he is back in recent interviews, discussing the latest strain of the novel coronavirus. In an interview with CNN, Fauci revived one of his most controversial claims, one that Lafayette residents have reacted strongly to - the efficacy of masks in preventing infection. During the interview, Fauci claimed that while masking didn't slow down the pandemic, there was evidence that on an \"individual basis,\" many citizens protected themselves. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the effect on the pandemic as a whole, the data is less strong,\u201d Fauci, who retired from his senior health post last year, said. \u201cBut when you talk about an individual basis of someone protecting themselves \u2026 there\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s many studies that show that there is an advantage [to masks].\u201d But as pointed out by WGNO, there are plenty who call claims like this misleading.

At 82 he is older than President Biden or Mitch McConnell, but he moves around and thinks as clearly as a man 20 years younger. He is smart, glib, telegenic, and an accomplished con man. Well, a con man may be a bit harsh. Perhaps I should say politician, although he is a better and smoother liar than most politicians because he can draw on the reserve of credibility that comes from wearing a white coat and claiming the mantle of science. As Jazz wrote yesterday, Fauci is back on the COVIDmania tour, pushing his debunked narrative that the policies he pushed during the height of the pandemic will really work this time, even though they proved completely worthless in stopping the spread of COVID and absolutely disastrous to the economic and social health of the country. He made the mistake of showing up on the normally friendly CNN to promote hysteria and in particular mask mandates yet again, and this time he got some serious pushback from Michael Smerconish. It\u2019s about time. At issue was the Cochrane Review meta-analysis of mask studies, which conclusively demonstrated that population-level mask mandates don\u2019t work to slow or stop the spread of COVID (or the flu). This is as true for N95 masks as with the absurd surgical masks, or the even more absurd cloth masks that the CDC and Fauci pretended could do anything but make things even worse.

Cases are undeniably on the rise right now, and Montana Governor Greg Gianforte did not keep quiet on the hot topic. \"We ended our state of emergency from the pandemic over two years ago,\" Gianforte said in his post to X, the site formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday. \"We will not bring lockdowns and mask mandates to Montana.\" Biden has thus far not tested positive since his wife's case began, and the First Lady has only had mild symptoms as of now. President Biden attended a ceremony honoring an 81-year-old Vietnam veteran Tuesday, and, after he had shown up wearing a mask, he took his mask off during the event, shaking hands with the unmasked soldier. Both the national emergency and mask mandates have ended, but the virus is still out there.

The former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 82, was branded as the nation's Covid czar because he sternly recommended wearing face coverings and social distancing in public. As early as April 2020 , he told fearful Americans: 'If everybody does that, we\u2019re each protecting each other. Because the data is, it's more efficient to prevent transmitting to others than it is to prevent transmission to yourself.' People had to wear masks in schools, public transportation, restaurants, and workplaces. But following a series of leaked emails and interviews since the height of the pandemic, Fauci has been criticized for flip-flopping in his beliefs as he admitted there is a lack of evidence to suggest they worked in halting the spread of the virus. He recently told CNN : 'When you're talking about the effect on the epidemic or the pandemic as a whole, the data are less strong. 'But there are other studies, that show at an individual level, for individuals, they might be protective.'

No reason for concern. That theme characterized the answers of Rams receivers Monday when asked what it would be like to play the Seattle Seahawks without their star teammate, whose status for the season opener on Sunday is in doubt because of a lingering hamstring injury. Coach Sean McVay said Kupp was in Minnesota receiving an evaluation from unspecified experts. A decision on Kupp\u2019s availability for the opener \u2014 and beyond \u2014 was pending, he said. So the Rams, coming off a 5-12 season, are preparing for their opener without one of their few established stars.

Despite the injuries, the Rams receiver would still be a first-ballot inductee into the fictional Fantasy Football Hall of Fame. Kupp has provided some great moments \u2014 and great production \u2014 over the years to owners and bettors. His machine-like game has solidified the receiver near the top of draft boards for years and tormented defenses like no other. As the calendar flips to the 2023 season, suddenly Kupp's status is a question mark. On a team that's filled with uncertainty, fantasy owners are left to wonder if it's still worth drafting Kupp early or pivoting to the next big thing. A hamstring injury early in training camp only helped intensify those concerns. As drafts ramp up with the regular season fast approaching, Kupp might now be one of fantasy's biggest mysteries.

Football fans, fantasy owners, and the Rams all held their breath on Aug. 1 when it was reported that Kupp left practice with an injury. Details at the time were scarce before it was later announced to be a hamstring issue. The collective sigh of relief would've been enough to keep wind farms in California going for the foreseeable future, as Kupp would be fine.

In 2018, he missed the Rams\u2019 run to Super Bowl LIII because of a season ending knee injury. In 2020, he suffered another knee injury that forced him to sit out an NFC divisional-round defeat loss to the Green Bay Packers.

Despite the injuries, the Rams receiver would still be a first-ballot inductee into the fictional Fantasy Football Hall of Fame. Kupp has provided some great moments \u2014 and great production \u2014 over the years to owners and bettors. His machine-like game has solidified the receiver near the top of draft boards for years and tormented defenses like no other. As the calendar flips to the 2023 season, suddenly Kupp's status is a question mark. On a team that's filled with uncertainty, fantasy owners are left to wonder if it's still worth drafting Kupp early or pivoting to the next big thing. A hamstring injury early in training camp only helped intensify those concerns. As drafts ramp up with the regular season fast approaching, Kupp might now be one of fantasy's biggest mysteries. Below, we'll break down Kupp's 2023 fantasy outlook and decide whether he's a smart draft pick in fantasy football leagues. DOMINATE YOUR DRAFT: Ultimate 2023 Fantasy Cheat Sheet Cooper Kupp injury update: How long will Rams' WR be out? UPDATE 8/31: Kupp reportedly suffered a \"setback\" in practice on Thursday and is considered \" day-to-day .\" Obviously, this puts his Week 1 status in jeopardy, but the \"day-to-day\" designation gives us hope he won't be out long, if at all. Football fans, fantasy owners, and the Rams all held their breath on Aug. 1 when it was reported that Kupp left practice with an injury. Details at the time were scarce before it was later announced to be a hamstring issue. The collective sigh of relief would've been enough to keep wind farms in California going for the foreseeable future, as Kupp would be fine. Just a few weeks later, the receiver was back at practice on Aug. 23. In fact, head coach Sean McVay gave what is likely the best news anyone could've hoped for. \"[H]e looked really good,\" McVay said . \"He looked like Cooper. And that\u2019s an excellent player for us.\" Barring a setback, Kupp is on track to play in Week 1 when the Rams visit the Seahawks. 2023 PPR RANKINGS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Ks | Top 200 | S-Flex | IDP Cooper Kupp's 2023 fantasy ranking and ADP Not much has gone right for the Rams since winning Super Bowl LVI, and you don't have to look much further than Kupp to find out why.

The latest information available states that Kupp is \"day-to-day\" with a hamstring injury and has been labeled as \"questionable\" for Week 1. [1] However, there has been no official statement from the Rams or Kupp himself regarding his availability for the upcoming season.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kupp has a history of injuries, having missed several games in the past due to knee and ankle issues. [2] Additionally, the Rams have been cautious with Kupp's injury, labeling him as \"day-to-day\" and not rushing him back to action. [1]\n\nIn light of this information, it is uncertain if Cooper Kupp will play this season. Fantasy owners and Rams fans alike will have to wait and see how Kupp's injury progresses before making any definitive decisions about his availability.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What is the current status of Cooper Kupp's injury?\n* How has Cooper Kupp's injury history affected his fantasy value?\n* What are the Rams' chances of success this season without Cooper Kupp?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nAs of the latest information found, Cooper Kupp's status for the season opener of the 2023 NFL season is unknown due to a lingering hamstring injury. He is currently receiving an evaluation from unspecified experts. The decision on Kupp's availability for the opener \u2014 and beyond \u2014 is still pending as of 2023-09-04, Monday. \n\nHowever, if Cooper Kupp doesn't play against the Seattle Seahawks in the season opener, other players such as Van Jefferson, Tutu Atwell, rookie Puka Nacua or perhaps Ben Skowronek will start at receiver. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses based on the information provided. Assistant A provided a comprehensive response, mentioning Kupp's injury history and the uncertainty surrounding his availability for the season. Assistant B also provided accurate information, mentioning the pending decision on Kupp's availability and the potential replacements if he doesn't play. However, Assistant A went a step further by suggesting related questions, which is against the rules. Therefore, Assistant B is the better assistant in this case. \n\nFinal Verdict: [[B]]", "turn": 1, "tstamp": 1695173607.083958}

The number of toss-up states is declining, which is an obvious trend that might have a big influence on the election\u2019s dynamics. States that are up for grabs are ones where any major party has a possibility of winning, and the election results are unpredictable. These states often become campaign focus spots, drawing a lot of attention and funding from candidates and their parties. The number of actual toss-up states has decreased recently. The polarization of American politics has made the electoral map more predictable, along with demographic changes and shifting voter preferences. Some states\u2019 political inclinations are changing as a result of population shifts. For instance, states with aging, mostly rural populations often vote Republican, whereas those with expanding urban populations typically tilt Democratic. Examining the 2024 Presidential Election Landscape Over time, some states\u2019 allegiance to one party or the other has become more steadfast. places that were formerly thought to be firmly Republican, like Texas and Georgia, have shown indications of becoming more competitive, but places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have turned into decisive states. Voters are becoming more firmly committed to their party affiliations as a result of the widening political chasm in the nation. This makes it harder for candidates to persuade unsure voters in established toss-up states. Campaigns are becoming more data-driven and focused on mobilizing their base rather than appealing to those who are still uncertain. As a result, politicians and political parties are less likely to devote resources to states that are not clearly in their favor.

The argument for disqualifying Trump comes from Section 3 of the amendment, which states that an elected official cannot assume public office if they engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or had \"given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof\" unless the official in question is granted amnesty by a two-thirds vote of Congress. Contingents in several U.S. states feel that the former president's actions during the January 6th, 2021, Capitol riot fit the bill. The discussion has gained credibility since two members of the Federalist Society, a conservative group interested in the current state of legal order, supported the concept in writings for the Pennsylvania Law Review. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) and other Secretary of States from Georgia, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania have been discussing this possibility for over a year in regards to legally challenging Donald Trump's candidacy.

But one thing is already clear: the race will almost certainly be decided by a handful of voters in the very few states not entirely secure for either party. The roster of swing states that both sides can genuinely hope to win may be as small next year as at any point in modern history \u2013 no more than seven or eight and perhaps as few as four. On such a concentrated battlefield, the margin between success and failure for the two parties may be achingly narrow and the competition for voters fiercely intense. \u201cNever have so few people had such a big impact in deciding the future of American politics,\u201d said Doug Sosnik who served as the chief White House political adviser for Bill Clinton. Multiple measures track the evolution of what could be called the incredible shrinking presidential battlefield. The most revealing is the growing number of states where either party has established a consistent advantage in the presidential race. Twenty states have voted for the Democratic nominee in each of the past four presidential elections, from Barack Obama\u2019s first win in 2008 through Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. Twenty states have likewise voted for the GOP presidential nominee in all four of those contests. That means 40 of the 50 states, or 80%, have voted the same way in four consecutive presidential elections. That\u2019s the highest level of such consistency since the turn of the 20th century. Even when Franklin D. Roosevelt won four consecutive elections from 1932 through 1944, only about two-thirds of the states voted the same way each time.\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Why this presidential campaign may feel familiar to many Americans\nbody: NEW YORK \u2014 The end of Labor Day weekend would typically mark the start of a furious sprint to the Iowa caucuses as candidates battle for their party's presidential nomination. But as the 2024 campaign comes into greater focus, the usual frenzy is yielding to a sense of inevitability. Among Republicans, Donald Trump is dominating the primary field, outpacing rivals with resumes as governors, diplomats and entrepreneurs that would normally prove compelling. The former president's strength comes despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 multiple criminal indictments that threaten to overshadow any serious debate about the future of the country. And for now, the tens of millions of dollars that Republican rivals are pouring into the race are doing little to diminish Trump's stature, fueling concerns among his GOP critics who fear the primary is essentially over before it begins.

The number of toss-up states is declining, which is an obvious trend that might have a big influence on the election\u2019s dynamics. States that are up for grabs are ones where any major party has a possibility of winning, and the election results are unpredictable. These states often become campaign focus spots, drawing a lot of attention and funding from candidates and their parties. The number of actual toss-up states has decreased recently. The polarization of American politics has made the electoral map more predictable, along with demographic changes and shifting voter preferences. Some states\u2019 political inclinations are changing as a result of population shifts. For instance, states with aging, mostly rural populations often vote Republican, whereas those with expanding urban populations typically tilt Democratic. Examining the 2024 Presidential Election Landscape Over time, some states\u2019 allegiance to one party or the other has become more steadfast. places that were formerly thought to be firmly Republican, like Texas and Georgia, have shown indications of becoming more competitive, but places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have turned into decisive states. Voters are becoming more firmly committed to their party affiliations as a result of the widening political chasm in the nation. This makes it harder for candidates to persuade unsure voters in established toss-up states. Campaigns are becoming more data-driven and focused on mobilizing their base rather than appealing to those who are still uncertain. As a result, politicians and political parties are less likely to devote resources to states that are not clearly in their favor. Campaign tactics may be affected by the\n2. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Election Officials In 3 States Are Preparing To Disqualify Donald Trump From Running For President\nbody: Election officials in three battleground states are attempting to disqualify former President Donald Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot, citing the 14th Amendment's Section 3. The argument for disqualifying Trump comes from Section 3 of the amendment, which states that an elected official cannot assume public office if they engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or had \"given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof\" unless the official in question is granted amnesty by a two-thirds vote of Congress. Contingents in several U.S. states feel that the former president's actions during the January 6th, 2021, Capitol riot fit the bill. The discussion has gained credibility since two members of the Federalist Society, a conservative group interested in the current state of legal order, supported the concept in writings for the Pennsylvania Law Review. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) and other Secretary of States from Georgia, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania have been discussing this possibility for over a year in regards to legally challenging Donald Trump's candidacy.

But one thing is already clear: the race will almost certainly be decided by a handful of voters in the very few states not entirely secure for either party. The roster of swing states that both sides can genuinely hope to win may be as small next year as at any point in modern history \u2013 no more than seven or eight and perhaps as few as four. On such a concentrated battlefield, the margin between success and failure for the two parties may be achingly narrow and the competition for voters fiercely intense. \u201cNever have so few people had such a big impact in deciding the future of American politics,\u201d said Doug Sosnik who served as the chief White House political adviser for Bill Clinton. Multiple measures track the evolution of what could be called the incredible shrinking presidential battlefield. The most revealing is the growing number of states where either party has established a consistent advantage in the presidential race. Twenty states have voted for the Democratic nominee in each of the past four presidential elections, from Barack Obama\u2019s first win in 2008 through Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. Twenty states have likewise voted for the GOP presidential nominee in all four of those contests. That means 40 of the 50 states, or 80%, have voted the same way in four consecutive presidential elections. That\u2019s the highest level of such consistency since the turn of the 20th century. Even when Franklin D. Roosevelt won four consecutive elections from 1932 through 1944, only about two-thirds of the states voted the same way each time.\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Why this presidential campaign may feel familiar to many Americans\nbody: NEW YORK \u2014 The end of Labor Day weekend would typically mark the start of a furious sprint to the Iowa caucuses as candidates battle for their party's presidential nomination. But as the 2024 campaign comes into greater focus, the usual frenzy is yielding to a sense of inevitability. Among Republicans, Donald Trump is dominating the primary field, outpacing rivals with resumes as governors, diplomats and entrepreneurs that would normally prove compelling. The former president's strength comes despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 multiple criminal indictments that threaten to overshadow any serious debate about the future of the country. And for now, the tens of millions of dollars that Republican rivals are pouring into the race are doing little to diminish Trump's stature, fueling concerns among his GOP critics who fear the primary is essentially over before it begins. As one troubled front-runner tightens his grip on the Republican nomination, President Joe Biden is on a glide path to victory on the Democratic side. The 80-year-old incumbent is facing only token opposition for the Democratic nomination despite concerns about his age and performance from many within his own party.

He had also pleaded guilty after his trial of attempting to intimidate witnesses during the trial. According to the Butte County District Attorney's Office, Peter Lee Flaming, 53, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with an additional 39 years to life after he serves those 20 years. Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said the jury took less than two hours to return guilty verdicts on all charges and special allegations. Ramsey said this case began last March when Butte County Sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a suspicious vehicle crash in the Thermalito area. When they arrived, deputies found the victim, 47, in the driver\u2019s seat of the crashed vehicle, bleeding profusely from three gunshot wounds. The victim told deputies he had been shot at a different location, but drove away until he lost control of his vehicle. Deputies were able to administer life-saving measures until medical personnel arrived and transported the victim to the hospital, where he received emergency surgery and ultimately recovered. Deputies learned in their investigation that the person who shot the victim was Flaming, a friend of the victim and that Flaming had shot the victim as the victim was exiting his vehicle that he slept in on Flaming\u2019s property in Thermalito. Deputies responded to Flaming\u2019s residence, but Flaming had fled the area. Later, Flaming was arrested without incident when he returned to his house and a good Samaritan reported seeing him. Ramsey said the evidence presented at the trial showed that Flaming had an ongoing disagreement with the victim over a mutual female friend, and on the morning of March 19, 2023, he exited his house and shot the victim three times. Flaming then fled the area. The gun was never recovered. Ramsey said that Flaming also pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to intimidate the victim and a key witness at his trial.

Welte in the U.S. District Court, Fargo, North Dakota. This sentencing follows a complex trial that revealed Um's involvement in a transnational drug trafficking organization responsible for distributing fentanyl and fentanyl analogues in the United States. The case, known as \"Operation Denial,\" underscores the serious consequences of international drug trafficking and the collaborative efforts to combat it. Background On April 11, 2023, Marie Um faced trial in Fargo, North Dakota, as part of a broader investigation into the trafficking of fentanyl and its analogues. Um was found guilty of several charges, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribute controlled substances, conspiracy to import controlled substances, and money laundering conspiracy. The jury determined that Um's actions had led to nine overdoses, including four deaths and five serious bodily injuries, in various states across the United States. Operation Denial \"Operation Denial\" is an Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation aimed at dismantling international fentanyl trafficking networks. This operation received crucial support from the Special Operations Division (S.O.D.) in Washington, DC, as part of \"Operation Deadly Merchant.\" The investigation was initiated in North Dakota in 2015 following an overdose death in Grand Forks, ND, involving Bailey Henke. The investigation's results As a result of Operation Denial, a total of 31 defendants have been charged in North Dakota, with an additional three defendants charged in Oregon.

Peter Wilby, 78, who previously worked as editor of the Independent on Sunday and the New Statesman, had 167 indecent images of children on his computer, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. When interviewed by police, Wilby admitted having viewed abuse material since the 1990s and said he had a sexual interest in children. After working as an education correspondent for various newspapers, Wilby joined The Independent on Sunday in 1990 and went on to become its editor. He was also the editor of the New Statesman from 1998 to 2005. Wilby has since written various columns for publications including The Guardian, with work published as recently as November last year. The journalist was charged with three counts of making indecent images of children, to which he later pleaded guilty, the NCA said. Investigators said he had been accessing the material online from his home in Essex. At Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday he was sentenced to ten months in prison, suspended for two years, and was placed on the sex offenders\u2019 register for five years. He was also ordered to undertake 40 hours rehabilitation and was handed a ten-year sexual harm prevention order. Adam Sprague, operations manager at the NCA, said: \u201cThe material accessed by Wilby and recovered from his computer showed real children being cruelly and sexually abused. \u201cHe was viewing this content while working as the editor of prominent national news outlets, a role in which he was entrusted to form the news agenda for the British public. A trust which he has greatly betrayed. \u201cWhile there is a global demand for this material, children will continue to be abused. The NCA is committed to tackling child sexual abuse in all its forms, to disrupt offenders and protect children.\u201d Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Sick Peter Wilby, 78, was this week sentenced after he was found in possession of 167 indecent images of children. Twenty-two of the pictures were classed as Category A images - the most serious. The former editor, who held top roles at the New Statesman and The Independent along with writing opinion pieces for The Guardian, later admitted he had an inappropriate interest in children while in top media positions. Wilby, who had been arrested by the National Crime Agency at his Essex home last October, was given a 10-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. The former editor was also given a rehabilitation requirement of 40 hours and is subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order. He was also placed on the sex offenders register for five years. The 78-year-old has written multiple columns slamming the media's coverage of paedophiles. His articles remain online to read, including those critical of investigations into paedophilia. The Guardian has today said it is reviewing Wilby's columns. In one article written in 2012, he suggests the \"hysteria\" around investigating paedophiles made those accused of child sex offences the new \"victims\". And he suggested victims of child abuse themselves would make false allegations \"in hope of substantial payments.\" In another piece entitled Prints of Darkness, published online in January 2007, Wilby slammed press campaigns that he thought weren't successful - including those investigating child paedophilia. And he suggested that campaigns that demanded greater transparency over the location of child sex offenders were unsuccessful. Wilby wrote: \"Since most child abuse is committed by parents and other close relatives in the first place.\" In another column, published online in 2008, he blasted the media's coverage of a children's care home in Jersey - describing the investigation into paedophiles as a \"witch-hunt\".

About 15 people wearing Nazi insignia and waving flags gathered outside the Disney Springs shopping center for about two hours, according to deputies.

About 15 people wearing clothing and bearing flags emblazoned with Nazi insignia demonstrated outside the entrance to the Disney Springs shopping center, said the Orange County Sheriff's Office, which said deputies were dispatched around 10:40 a.m. According to the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights organization dedicated to countering extremism, participants carried antisemitic, white supremacist and anti-LGBTQ flags and signs.

The extremists dispersed after about two hours, and no one was arrested, the sheriff's office said. Representatives for Walt Disney World did not respond to requests for comment Sunday afternoon.

Going back to the 1990s, community organizations hosted unofficial \u201cGay Days\u201d at Magic Kingdom, later extending the event throughout the four Central Florida Disney Parks. The Walt Disney Company mostly returned that support. Though they initially warned other guests about \u201chomosexuals\u201d gathering at Walt Disney World Resort, the House of Mouse provided insurance for Disney Cast Members\u2019 civil partners before same-sex marriage was legalized long before other corporations. Despite conservative protest, Walt Disney Studios added LGBTQIA+ representation to films starting in the mid-2010s. Former Disney CEO Bob Chapek reaffirmed the company\u2019s support for the community in 2022. Directly defying a warning from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the executive publicly disavowed the Parental Rights in Education Act, popularly known as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law. Though it resulted in numerous legal battles between DeSantis and Walt Disney World Resort, Disney stood by its stance. They released their first \u201cofficial\u201d Disney Pride merchandise collection later that year, donating proceeds to LGBTQIA+ charities. Disney Cast Members marched in more than a dozen Pride parades worldwide. Pride Month murals became permanent installations at Walt Disney World Resort. Current Disney CEO Bob Iger publicly reaffirmed the company\u2019s pro-LGBTQIA+ stance numerous times and backed a lawsuit against DeSantis. But some LGBTQIA+ guests are hesitant to visit Walt Disney World Resort, especially after Saturday\u2019s Neo-Nazi protests. \u201cI booked a trip to Disney World almost a year ago and now the timing is quickly arriving, I\u2019m concerned about the current political climate in Florida with regards to LGBTQ+ families,\u201d Reddit user u/Randomvicgirl wrote. \u201cWe are huge Disney fans and we were exciting to experience our little ones first trip but we\u2019re feeling nervous now especially since Canada issued a travel advisory this past week for LGBTQ+ travellers to certain states.\u201d Disney Parks fans were empathetic to the family\u2019s concerns. \u201cLiteral Nazis are right at the front gates of the resort at the moment,\u201d said u/BroadwayCatDad. \u201cAll these comments talking about how safe it is but interesting how literally no one is mentioning the ACTUAL REAL LIFE NAZIS protesting at the gates,\u201d u/FairoyFae agreed. \u201cLiteral f**king Nazis.

This initiative is a collaboration between Tioga County Public Health, ASAP Coalition, Mental Hygiene, and CASA-Trinity. The goal is to combat the opioid crisis by offering free Narcan kits and naloxone training. The event, first held in West Virginia in 2020, seeks to raise awareness about substance use disorder and opioid overdose. Opioids, particularly synthetic ones like fentanyl, are highly addictive. Their use has led to a rise in opioid overdoses in Tioga County, particularly in rural areas with slower emergency response times. Naloxone, also known as Narcan, is a medication that can counteract an opioid overdose if given promptly. Narcan availability in Tioga County has increased through Overdose Prevention Programs, Public Access Narcan Boxes, and pharmacies.

How\u2019s the Middle Class Scholarship going so far?\nbody: Stay up-to-date with free briefings on topics that matter to all Californians. Subscribe to CalMatters today for nonprofit news in your inbox. California cemented its status among the most affordable states to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree after lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom fulfilled their promise to expand the state\u2019s Middle Class Scholarship program by another $227 million in this year\u2019s budget deal. That overhauled scholarship, which debuted last year, is now a $859 million juggernaut. It\u2019s also a growing slice of the state\u2019s financial aid pie: Between 2016 and 2022 , California lawmakers poured roughly $1.4 billion more into grants and scholarships, bringing the state\u2019s total contribution to around $3.5 billion. Using new data that examines how the Middle Class Scholarship helped students in its first year, a CalMatters analysis shows that the grant worked largely as intended, sending more money to students of higher-income families. But the program has frustrated some advocacy groups, who want the state to spend more on lower-income students, especially those who are ineligible for existing state financial aid. For lawmakers grappling with a shaky state financial outlook while also attempting to rein in the cost of college, this is a tough needle to thread. The scholarship itself\n2. publish date: 2023-05-31, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: What It Really Costs to Be Middle-Class\nbody: Some people think of the \"middle-class,\" and picture a big house with a white picket fence and a healthy bank account. But that\u2019s not always what having a middle-class income in the United States looks like. Often, being in the middle class means acquiring a lot of debt, struggling to pay the mortgage, and living paycheck to paycheck. If that sounds like you, you are not alone. Here's why you might feel like you live in poverty even though you're considered to be middle-class in America. 10 Least Tax-Friendly States for Middle-Class Families Middle-Class Income Being in the middle class is something that many people and families have aspired to do over the years. In recent years, about half of people in the U.S. have been considered \"middle-class.\" Some people with middle-class incomes feel as though they are living in poverty, and the numbers corroborate those feelings. Data show that many \"middle-class\" families can't make ends meet or afford necessities in some cases. By the time you account for all the costs it takes to achieve middle-class status, you might not fare much better than those with incomes below the poverty line. The federal poverty level for a family of four is $30,000 in 2023. According to U.S. Census Bureau data , the median (middle-class) household income was $70,784 in 2021 (most recent statistics).

If you purchase anything through these affiliated links, 247wallst.com may earn a commission. The rising cost of living in the United States in recent years, coupled with longer-term stagnation of wages, have eroded the ranks of the American middle class - which has long been a pillar of stability and driver of growth in the U.S. economy. Typically, middle class households have disposable income for luxuries such as vacations and eating at restaurants, and are also able to put away money for savings and retirement. But because of economic conditions, households that fall in the middle of the income spectrum in much of the country may no longer meet some of these benchmarks of middle-class status. Using metro area level data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2021 American Community Survey, 24/7 Wall St. identified the city with the weakest middle class in each state. For the purposes of this story, the middle class is defined as the middle 20% of earners at the household level. For each state, the metro area with the lowest income ceiling for the middle quintile of earners ranks as having the poorest middle class. All data is for 2021. It is important to note that Delaware, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont are each home to only one metro area. As a result, the city listed for each of these states ranks as having the poorest middle class by default only.

How\u2019s the Middle Class Scholarship going so far?\nbody: Stay up-to-date with free briefings on topics that matter to all Californians. Subscribe to CalMatters today for nonprofit news in your inbox. California cemented its status among the most affordable states to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree after lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom fulfilled their promise to expand the state\u2019s Middle Class Scholarship program by another $227 million in this year\u2019s budget deal. That overhauled scholarship, which debuted last year, is now a $859 million juggernaut. It\u2019s also a growing slice of the state\u2019s financial aid pie: Between 2016 and 2022 , California lawmakers poured roughly $1.4 billion more into grants and scholarships, bringing the state\u2019s total contribution to around $3.5 billion. Using new data that examines how the Middle Class Scholarship helped students in its first year, a CalMatters analysis shows that the grant worked largely as intended, sending more money to students of higher-income families. But the program has frustrated some advocacy groups, who want the state to spend more on lower-income students, especially those who are ineligible for existing state financial aid. For lawmakers grappling with a shaky state financial outlook while also attempting to rein in the cost of college, this is a tough needle to thread. The scholarship itself\n2. publish date: 2023-05-31, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: What It Really Costs to Be Middle-Class\nbody: Some people think of the \"middle-class,\" and picture a big house with a white picket fence and a healthy bank account. But that\u2019s not always what having a middle-class income in the United States looks like. Often, being in the middle class means acquiring a lot of debt, struggling to pay the mortgage, and living paycheck to paycheck. If that sounds like you, you are not alone. Here's why you might feel like you live in poverty even though you're considered to be middle-class in America. 10 Least Tax-Friendly States for Middle-Class Families Middle-Class Income Being in the middle class is something that many people and families have aspired to do over the years. In recent years, about half of people in the U.S. have been considered \"middle-class.\" Some people with middle-class incomes feel as though they are living in poverty, and the numbers corroborate those feelings. Data show that many \"middle-class\" families can't make ends meet or afford necessities in some cases. By the time you account for all the costs it takes to achieve middle-class status, you might not fare much better than those with incomes below the poverty line. The federal poverty level for a family of four is $30,000 in 2023. According to U.S. Census Bureau data , the median (middle-class) household income was $70,784 in 2021 (most recent statistics).

If you purchase anything through these affiliated links, 247wallst.com may earn a commission. The rising cost of living in the United States in recent years, coupled with longer-term stagnation of wages, have eroded the ranks of the American middle class - which has long been a pillar of stability and driver of growth in the U.S. economy. Typically, middle class households have disposable income for luxuries such as vacations and eating at restaurants, and are also able to put away money for savings and retirement. But because of economic conditions, households that fall in the middle of the income spectrum in much of the country may no longer meet some of these benchmarks of middle-class status. Using metro area level data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2021 American Community Survey, 24/7 Wall St. identified the city with the weakest middle class in each state. For the purposes of this story, the middle class is defined as the middle 20% of earners at the household level. For each state, the metro area with the lowest income ceiling for the middle quintile of earners ranks as having the poorest middle class. All data is for 2021. It is important to note that Delaware, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont are each home to only one metro area. As a result, the city listed for each of these states ranks as having the poorest middle class by default only.

Laraine Newman, Belzer\u2019s longtime friend and fellow SNL cast member, confirmed his passing on Sunday. Writer Bill Scheft, another longtime friend of the actor, said Belzer died early Sunday at his home in Bozouls in southwest France. \u201cHe had lots of health issues, and his last words were, \u2018Fuck you, motherfucker,'\u201d Scheft told The Hollywood Reporter. A native of Bridgeport, Connecticut, Belzer began his career as a stand-up comedian in the 1970s, quickly winning over audiences thanks to his sharp wit and acerbic style. In 1975 he was hired to serve as the warmup comedian for SNL\u2019s inaugural season, and proceeded to make several guest appearances throughout the show\u2019s first five seasons. In the 1980s, Belzer had small roles in films like Fame and Scarface. He also appeared in music videos for Mike + The Mechanics (\u201cTaken In\u201d), Pat Benatar (\u201cLe Bel Age\u201d), and Kansas (\u201cCan\u2019t Cry Anymore\u201d).

When even other Law & Order series fell to cancelation, the trials and tribulations of Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) continued. Hargitay\u2019s real-life advocacy for survivors of sex crimes as well as the ripped-from-the-headlines storytelling has kept the series going for the past two decades. And even casting shake-ups of fan-favorite characters have not lessened fan appreciation for the series. If anything, the series has become more popular, especially with the return of hot-headed original cast member \u2013 Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni). Things are hotter than ever between the two former partners when Stabler does double duty between SVU and his series, Law & Order: Organized Crime. Now, heading into season 25, viewers are clamoring to know when they can see their favorite characters again. Release window While a new season of Law & Order: SVU is guaranteed going forward, the exact timing of season 25 is less clear. Typically a new season of the crime procedural airs on the fall schedule, but recent developments in the entertainment industry have made that less certain. The dual strike in Hollywood has continued since May, ensuring that not only writers are unable to contribute, but actors as well. The AMPTP has recently enlisted the services of yet another PR team, meaning that it could be some time before we see a new season of the series.

Meloni left the series at the end of SVU\u2018s twelfth season, so his character Elliot Stabler retired from the police force off-screen in the Season 13 premiere. Fans clamored for his return, and in April 2020, an announcement was made that Christopher Meloni agreed to return in his famous detective role on a new SVU spinoff series. This new show, called Law & Order: Organized Crime, would follow Stabler coming out of retirement to head up an NYPD task force on organized crime. This was great news to Elliot Stabler fans! This new series wouldn\u2019t just focus on Elliot Stabler\u2019s detective work. However, to personalize the fan favorite, series producers decided to focus on Stabler\u2019s personal life in addition to following his police work. This brought to the fore several characters in Stabler\u2019s family, including his son Elliot Stabler, Jr. So, who is this character, and what happened to him on the show? The character Elliot Stabler, Jr., called Eli by his friends and family and played by Nicky Torchia, was born in 2007 and is Elliot and Kathy Stabler\u2019s youngest child.

After all, we\u2019ve seen that Quantum Leap and Magnum PI will be back in October. This is where the bad news continues. We\u2019re not going to see new episodes of SVU for the rest of the year. When will Law & Order: SVU Season 25 premiere on NBC? Why would NBC change the schedule so dramatically? Is it a bad sign for the Law & Order franchise? Not at all! NBC didn\u2019t want to change Thursdays too much. This is all linked to the current strike action. Back in May, NBC hoped for things to work out to bring a normal fall. The new schedule didn\u2019t come out until July when the actors joined the writers on strike. There has been little movement since then, and it means that NBC has no choice but to hold off a lot of the scripted content until next year. We don\u2019t know when next year. Maybe there is a chance of the show returning in January. This is all going to depend on when production restarts and when the episodes will be ready. We\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on things. The good news is NBC will bring some Law & Order reruns to kick off Thursday nights. We will also get new episodes of new shows The Irrational and Found and new episodes of Magnum PI.

He also appeared in music videos for Mike + The Mechanics (\u201cTaken In\u201d), Pat Benatar (\u201cLe Bel Age\u201d), and Kansas (\u201cCan\u2019t Cry Anymore\u201d). In the 1990s, Belzer transitioned back to television with roles on The Flash, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, and Homicide: Life on the Street. It was the latter role \u2014 as detective John Munch \u2014 that would come to define Belzer\u2019s career. Belzer ended up portraying Munch for 22 consecutive seasons.

When even other Law & Order series fell to cancelation, the trials and tribulations of Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) continued. Hargitay\u2019s real-life advocacy for survivors of sex crimes as well as the ripped-from-the-headlines storytelling has kept the series going for the past two decades. And even casting shake-ups of fan-favorite characters have not lessened fan appreciation for the series. If anything, the series has become more popular, especially with the return of hot-headed original cast member \u2013 Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni). Things are hotter than ever between the two former partners when Stabler does double duty between SVU and his series, Law & Order: Organized Crime. Now, heading into season 25, viewers are clamoring to know when they can see their favorite characters again. Release window While a new season of Law & Order: SVU is guaranteed going forward, the exact timing of season 25 is less clear. Typically a new season of the crime procedural airs on the fall schedule, but recent developments in the entertainment industry have made that less certain. The dual strike in Hollywood has continued since May, ensuring that not only writers are unable to contribute, but actors as well. The AMPTP has recently enlisted the services of yet another PR team, meaning that it could be some time before we see a new season of the series. In the best-case scenario, fans can expect season 25 to air in the 2024 winter schedule at the earliest, but that has yet to be determined. Returning cast What we can expect, however, is the return of Hargitay once the WGA and S\n3. publish date: 2023-08-20, Sunday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: What happened to Elliot Stabler\u2019s son, Eli, on \u2018Law & Order: Organized Crime?\u2019\nbody: Christopher Meloni was a massive fan favorite when he played the lead character Elliot Stabler during the first 12 seasons of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, costarring with Mariska Hargitay, who played Detective Olivia Benson. Meloni left the series at the end of SVU\u2018s twelfth season, so his character Elliot Stabler retired from the police force off-screen in the Season 13 premiere. Fans clamored for his return, and in April 2020, an announcement was made that Christopher Meloni agreed to return in his famous detective role on a new SVU spinoff series. This new show, called Law & Order: Organized Crime, would follow Stabler coming out of retirement to head up an NYPD task force on organized crime. This was great news to Elliot Stabler fans! This new series wouldn\u2019t just focus on Elliot Stabler\u2019s detective work. However, to personalize the fan favorite, series producers decided to focus on Stabler\u2019s personal life in addition to following his police work. This brought to the fore several characters in Stabler\u2019s family, including his son Elliot Stabler, Jr. So, who is this character, and what happened to him on the show? The character Elliot Stabler, Jr., called Eli by his friends and family and played by Nicky Torchia, was born in 2007 and is Elliot and Kathy Stabler\u2019s youngest child. He has four siblings: Kathleen, Elizabeth, Maureen, and Dickie. One dramatic storyline in Law & Order: Organized Crime followed Elliot Stabler\u2019s journey into accepting that Eli is really his son, as he initially doubted his paternity\n4. publish date: 2023-08-13, Sunday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Law & Order: SVU: Our Dream Spinoff\nbody: Some of our favorite Law & Order: SVU moments of the past several seasons have involved the captivating combination of Det.

The sweetness of the nuptials, however, was tamped down by the fact that Kelli Giddish, who plays Rollins, left the squad \u2014 and the show \u2014 at the end of the hour when Amanda took a teaching job that would keep her out of danger.

Law & Order: SVU Season 25 isn\u2019t coming this month, but when will it arrive? Fall TV is set to return, but it\u2019s looking very different to normal. We have some bad news for fans of the Dick Wolf shows. None of them are coming back this month, and that includes Law & Order: SVU Season 25. That just means we\u2019re waiting for a month, right? After all, we\u2019ve seen that Quantum Leap and Magnum PI will be back in October. This is where the bad news continues. We\u2019re not going to see new episodes of SVU for the rest of the year. When will Law & Order: SVU Season 25 premiere on NBC? Why would NBC change the schedule so dramatically? Is it a bad sign for the Law & Order franchise? Not at all! NBC didn\u2019t want to change Thursdays too much. This is all linked to the current strike action. Back in May, NBC hoped for things to work out to bring a normal fall. The new schedule didn\u2019t come out until July when the actors joined the writers on strike. There has been little movement since then, and it means that NBC has no choice but to hold off a lot of the scripted content until next year. We don\u2019t know when next year. Maybe there is a chance of the show returning in January. This is all going to depend on when production restarts and when the episodes will be ready. We\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on things. The good news is NBC will bring some Law & Order reruns to kick off Thursday nights. We will also get new episodes of new shows The Irrational and Found and new episodes of Magnum PI.

Zverev, the No. 12 seed, was serving at 2-2 in the fourth set of his match against No. 6 Jannik Sinner when he suddenly went to chair umpire James Keothavong and pointed toward the fan, who was sitting in a section behind the umpire. \"He just said the most famous Hitler phrase there is in this world,\" Zverev told Keothavong. \"It's not acceptable.\" Keothavong turned backward and asked the fan to identify himself, then asked fans to be respectful to both players. Then, during the changeover shortly after Zverev held serve, the fan was identified by spectators seated near him and was removed by security. \"A disparaging remark was directed toward Alexander Zverev,\" U.S. Tennis Association spokesman Chris Widmaier said. \"The fan was identified and escorted from the stadium.\" Zverev said after the match that he's had fans make derogatory comments before, but not involving Hitler. \"He started singing the anthem of Hitler that was back in the day. It was 'Deutschland Uber Alles' and it was a bit too much,\" Zverev said. \"I think he was getting involved in the match for a long time, though.

Although orientation has featured pride-themed events for the past several years, Fall 2023 was the first Pride Fest, which is a larger event designed to accommodate and celebrate more students. The move to Pride Fest makes a statement that the college has many LGBTQ+ students and wants to celebrate them, an especially important fact in 2023 when lawmakers and legislation across the country continue to target members of the LGBTQ+ community. According to Trans Legislation Tracker, in 2023, 566 anti-trans bills have been proposed in the U.S. in 49 states and at the national level. Eighty-three of those bills have been signed into law. These bills target necessary support for trans people; they have restricted things like providing gender-affirming care to youth, students having the right to use different pronouns in school without written parental permission and banning drag shows outside of \u201cadult-oriented\u201d businesses. Additionally, in 2022, Florida passed the bill which has since been referred to as \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay,\u201d which prohibited lessons on sexuality and gender expression for students pre-K through third grade.

Some of the top schools on the list include The Pennsylvania State University and the University of Pennsylvania [1], but also schools from Florida and Texas such as the University of North Florida, the University of Central Florida, the University of Texas at Dallas, and Texas Tech University [2][3][6]. However, these schools were excluded from the list due to new state laws in Florida and Texas that \"endanger and harm LGBTQ people\" as these laws effectively ban LGBTQ+ inclusion programs and services [3][6]. These laws were seen as weaponizing LGBTQ+ identities and were criticized for threatening the safety and well-being of students on campuses across the states of Florida and Texas [3][6]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information provided, it appears that there are several LGBTQ-friendly schools in red states.

For example, the University of North Florida [1], the University of Central Florida [2], and Texas Tech University [4] have all been included on Campus Pride's list of the \"Best of the Best LGBTQ-Friendly Colleges and Universities.\" These universities have been recognized for their efforts to create safe and inclusive environments for LGBTQ students, staff, and faculty.\n\nIt's worth noting that Campus Pride has also issued a \"red alert\" warning for universities in Florida and Texas, as new laws in these states may compromise the academic reputations of institutions and put LGBTQ students at risk [5]. However, the organization has stated that if legislation did not threaten the safety of LGBTQ+ people, these universities would have been included on the list [4].\n\nIf you are looking for LGBTQ-friendly schools in red states, it may be helpful to research universities that have been recognized for their LGBTQ-friendly policies and practices, as well as those that have been issued a \"red alert\" warning. Additionally, you may want to consider reaching out to LGBTQ student organizations or other resources on campus to get a better sense of the school's culture and support for LGBTQ students.\n\nSome related questions you may want to consider asking include:\n\n* What specific policies and practices does the university have in place to support LGBTQ students?\n* How does the university address issues of discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity?\n* Are there any LGBTQ student organizations or other resources on campus that can provide support and community for LGBTQ students?\n* How does the university's location in a red state impact the experiences of LGBTQ students on campus?\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

Although orientation has featured pride-themed events for the past several years, Fall 2023 was the first Pride Fest, which is a larger event designed to accommodate and celebrate more students. The move to Pride Fest makes a statement that the college has many LGBTQ+ students and wants to celebrate them, an especially important fact in 2023 when lawmakers and legislation across the country continue to target members of the LGBTQ+ community. According to Trans Legislation Tracker, in 2023, 566 anti-trans bills have been proposed in the U.S. in 49 states and at the national level. Eighty-three of those bills have been signed into law. These bills target necessary support for trans people; they have restricted things like providing gender-affirming care to youth, students having the right to use different pronouns in school without written parental permission and banning drag shows outside of \u201cadult-oriented\u201d businesses. Additionally, in 2022, Florida passed the bill which has since been referred to as \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay,\u201d which prohibited lessons on sexuality and gender expression for students pre-K through third grade.

I\u2019d say this represents a positive change almost across the board. Air Belgium operating Warsaw to New York flight LOT Polish Airlines operates daily service between Warsaw (WAW) and New York (JFK), with a flight that\u2019s ordinarily operated by the Boeing 787, which is LOT\u2019s only long haul aircraft. However, that will be changing over the coming months, per a schedule update that was just loaded. From October 29, 2023, through March 30, 2024, Air Belgium will be operating on behalf of LOT on the following daily flight: LO26 Warsaw to New York departing 4:50PM arriving 9:35PM LO27 New York to Warsaw departing 11:35PM arriving 1:05PM (+1 day) While this is currently only loaded through the end of the winter schedule in March 2024, it\u2019s my understanding that this is a one year agreement, so I expect this arrangement will be extended for the summer 2024 schedule as well. This is a wet lease arrangement, meaning that the aircraft and crew will be from Air Belgium, while you can expect the standard LOT food, drinks, and amenities. This isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve seen Air Belgium operate flights on behalf of LOT. Presumably it reflects that Air Belgium has some excess capacity (or at least feels it can make more money leasing out its planes than operating its own schedule), while LOT has an aircraft shortage. For those not familiar, Air Belgium is a quirky Belgian airline, which\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This means that all aircraft are being held at their departure airports, and flights in the air will continue to their planned destinations [1]. The issue is causing similar problems at airports across the United States [1].\n\nHowever, there is no information in the provided sources about the current status of United flights being canceled. It is possible that some flights may be canceled or delayed due to the technology issue, but without more up-to-date information, it is difficult to confirm whether this is the case.\n\nIf you are planning to travel with United Airlines and are concerned about the status of your flight, I recommend checking the airline's website or contacting their customer service directly for the most up-to-date information about your flight's status.\n\nRelated questions:\n\n* What is the cause of United Airlines' systemwide technology issue?\n* How many flights have been affected by the technology issue?\n* Are there any alternative flights or travel options available for passengers affected by the cancellations?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, United Airlines is currently experiencing a systemwide technology issue, which has resulted in a ground stop affecting its operations.

Congress has just 11 days when it\u2019s in session before the next federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, 2023. And in that time, it will need to enact all 12 appropriation bills to ensure that government agencies and departments have funding to keep programs going \u2013 or face a potential government shutdown. So will they pull it off? And what will happen if they don\u2019t? As an expert of public policy and former deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office, I feel that the challenge this year is the greatest faced since the enactment of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which made significant reforms in the process. This is due to the magnitude of the differences not only between the two parties but also between the House and Senate. A worse-case scenario could see a government shutdown for several weeks, or even a couple of months \u2013 and that could have a significant negative impact on the economy. The House of Representatives initially faced a workload of 12 appropriation bills to get through Congress. But just before the House broke for August recess, it passed one appropriation bill, for military construction. One down, 11 to go. The problem is the military construction bill is traditionally the easiest to pass, as it is very small: this year it stood at $19.1 billion in spending. This is substantially less than the largest bill, which is usually the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education bill. When reported, or passed, out of the committee in the Senate this year, that bill amounted to $224 billion. Providing money for military construction is also generally done without much controversy, as it includes funding for housing military families \u2013 something few members want to oppose. And while the military construction funding bill passed before the recess, the House leadership had also hoped to pass the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug bill but did not have the necessary votes for passage. Complicating matters is that ongoing funding bills could be delayed or derailed by ideological battles in Washington. The conservative Freedom Caucus in the House is pushing for tens of billions of dollars in cuts in the eight appropriation bills that fund domestic spending. The other four are military construction; defense; state and foreign operations; and the legislative branch itself. Part of this desire for cuts comes from the frustration that conservatives feel over there being virtually no reductions in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which lifted the debt ceiling and was negotiated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden in late May.

But for the U.S. research community, that\u2019s the best-case scenario in the short run as Congress returns this month from its summer recess and tries to agree on spending levels for the 2024 fiscal year that begins on 1 October. The government could shut down if Republicans and Democrats don\u2019t declare a truce. The next federal budget is one of several topics affecting science that await action by this divided Congress, where Democrats hold a narrow edge in the Senate and Republicans have an equally small majority in the House of Representatives. Legislators are also debating proposals for greater oversight of research collaborations with China and restrictions on research that alters the characteristics of pathogens, as well as a bill setting new funding targets for agricultural research. Biomedical scientists are also hoping the Senate will confirm Monica Bertagnolli, nominated in May, as the new head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The 2024 budget is the most contentious issue facing lawmakers. With no prospect of passing all 12 bills that set new spending levels by 1 October, Democratic leaders in both houses and many Republicans are calling for a continuing resolution (CR) that would freeze budgets at this year\u2019s levels for a few months while negotiations continue. But some three dozen staunch conservatives in the House have pledged to oppose a CR. They want Congress to roll back spending to 2022 levels, which could cut some research programs by 20% or more. Democrats vow not to let that happen. If Congress can\u2019t pass a CR by 30 September, however, most government activities would grind to a halt. Such temporary shutdowns are not uncommon. There have been four since 1995, including for 35 days in 2018\u201319. Once those shutdowns ended, Congress ultimately approved catchall spending bills that usually included small increases for research. Achieving that benign outcome will be harder this year. In May, a deal to avoid defaulting on the $31 trillion federal debt included a provision that would reduce federal spending by 1% from this year\u2019s levels if Congress failed to approve a 2024 budget for all agencies by 30 April 2024. Given that pressure to hold down government spending, science advocates don\u2019t expect any agency to get more than a minimal increase at best when Congress finally passes a 2024 budget. For example, NIH would get a 2% boost, to $47.8 billion, if Congress eventually adopts a Senate proposal. But if a House spending panel has its way, NIH would get a 6% cut. At the same time, committees in both houses have proposed giving the National Science Foundation some $300 million less than the $9.87 billion it received this year.

The House of Representatives has passed only one of the 12 appropriation bills needed to fund government programs for the 2024 fiscal year, which began on October 1, 2023 [1]. The military construction bill was passed before the summer recess, but the House leadership had hoped to pass the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug bill as well, but did not have the necessary votes [1].\n\nThe conservative Freedom Caucus in the House is pushing for tens of billions of dollars in cuts in the eight appropriation bills that fund domestic spending, which could delay or derail the funding bills [1]. Additionally, there are ideological battles brewing in Washington, which could further complicate matters [1].\n\nThe article states that a government shutdown for several weeks or even a couple of months could have a significant negative impact on the economy [1]. Moreover, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which lifted the debt ceiling and was negotiated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden in late May, has not led to the desired reductions in spending, leading to frustration among conservatives [1].\n\nGiven the challenges ahead, it is unclear if Congress will be able to pass all 12 appropriation bills before the next federal fiscal year begins on October 1, 2023. However, some lawmakers are calling for a continuing resolution (CR) that would freeze budgets at this year's levels for a few months while negotiations continue [2].\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the budget battles in Congress, you may want to explore the following related questions:\n\n1.

The House of Representatives initially faced a workload of 12 appropriation bills to get through Congress. But just before the House broke for August recess, it passed one appropriation bill, for military construction. One down, 11 to go. The problem is the military construction bill is traditionally the easiest to pass, as it is very small: this year it stood at $19.1 billion in spending. This is substantially less than the largest bill, which is usually the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education bill. When reported, or passed, out of the committee in the Senate this year, that bill amounted to $224 billion. Providing money for military construction is also generally done without much controversy, as it includes funding for housing military families \u2013 something few members want to oppose. And while the military construction funding bill passed before the recess, the House leadership had also hoped to pass the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug bill but did not have the necessary votes for passage. Complicating matters is that ongoing funding bills could be delayed or derailed by ideological battles in Washington. The conservative Freedom Caucus in the House is pushing for tens of billions of dollars in cuts in the eight appropriation bills that fund domestic spending. The other four are military construction; defense; state and foreign operations; and the legislative branch itself. Part of this desire for cuts comes from the frustration that conservatives feel over there being virtually no reductions in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which lifted the debt ceiling and was negotiated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden in late May.

Raymond Scheppach, University of Virginia (THE CONVERSATION) U.S. senators and representatives returning from their summer vacations will need to shake off their suntans in quick time and get down to business. Congress has just 11 days when it\u2019s in session before the next federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, 2023. And in that time, it will need to enact all 12 appropriation bills to ensure that government agencies and departments have funding to keep programs going \u2013 or face a potential government shutdown. Article continues below this ad So will they pull it off? And what will happen if they don\u2019t? As an expert of public policy and former deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office, I feel that the challenge this year is the greatest faced since the enactment of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which made significant reforms in the process. This is due to the magnitude of the differences not only between the two parties but also between the House and Senate. A worse-case scenario could see a government shutdown for several weeks, or even a couple of months \u2013 and that could have a significant negative impact on the economy.

But just before the House broke for August recess, it passed one appropriation bill, for military construction. One down, 11 to go.

But for the U.S. research community, that\u2019s the best-case scenario in the short run as Congress returns this month from its summer recess and tries to agree on spending levels for the 2024 fiscal year that begins on 1 October. The government could shut down if Republicans and Democrats don\u2019t declare a truce. The next federal budget is one of several topics affecting science that await action by this divided Congress, where Democrats hold a narrow edge in the Senate and Republicans have an equally small majority in the House of Representatives. Legislators are also debating proposals for greater oversight of research collaborations with China and restrictions on research that alters the characteristics of pathogens, as well as a bill setting new funding targets for agricultural research. Biomedical scientists are also hoping the Senate will confirm Monica Bertagnolli, nominated in May, as the new head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The 2024 budget is the most contentious issue facing lawmakers. With no prospect of passing all 12 bills that set new spending levels by 1 October, Democratic leaders in both houses and many Republicans are calling for a continuing resolution (CR) that would freeze budgets at this year\u2019s levels for a few months while negotiations continue. But some three dozen staunch conservatives in the House have pledged to oppose a CR. They want Congress to roll back spending to 2022 levels, which could cut some research programs by 20% or more. Democrats vow not to let that happen. If Congress can\u2019t pass a CR by 30 September, however, most government activities would grind to a halt. Such temporary shutdowns are not uncommon. There have been four since 1995, including for 35 days in 2018\u201319. Once those shutdowns ended, Congress ultimately approved catchall spending bills that usually included small increases for research. Achieving that benign outcome will be harder this year. In May, a deal to avoid defaulting on the $31 trillion federal debt included a provision that would reduce federal spending by 1% from this year\u2019s levels if Congress failed to approve a 2024 budget for all agencies by 30 April 2024. Given that pressure to hold down government spending, science advocates don\u2019t expect any agency to get more than a minimal increase at best when Congress finally passes a 2024 budget. For example, NIH would get a 2% boost, to $47.8 billion, if Congress eventually adopts a Senate proposal. But if a House spending panel has its way, NIH would get a 6% cut. At the same time, committees in both houses have proposed giving the National Science Foundation some $300 million less than the $9.87 billion it received this year.

The House of Representatives has passed only one of the 12 appropriation bills needed to fund government programs for the 2024 fiscal year, which began on October 1, 2023 [1]. The military construction bill was passed before the summer recess, but the House leadership had hoped to pass the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug bill as well, but did not have the necessary votes [1].\n\nThe conservative Freedom Caucus in the House is pushing for tens of billions of dollars in cuts in the eight appropriation bills that fund domestic spending, which could delay or derail the funding bills [1]. Additionally, there are ideological battles brewing in Washington, which could further complicate matters [1].\n\nThe article states that a government shutdown for several weeks or even a couple of months could have a significant negative impact on the economy [1]. Moreover, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which lifted the debt ceiling and was negotiated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden in late May, has not led to the desired reductions in spending, leading to frustration among conservatives [1].\n\nGiven the challenges ahead, it is unclear if Congress will be able to pass all 12 appropriation bills before the next federal fiscal year begins on October 1, 2023. However, some lawmakers are calling for a continuing resolution (CR) that would freeze budgets at this year's levels for a few months while negotiations continue [2].\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the budget battles in Congress, you may want to explore the following related questions:\n\n1. What are the main sticking points in the budget negotiations between Democrats and Republicans in Congress?\n2.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) announced that the federal government\u2019s budget deficit more than doubled through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year compared to last year. In the latest Congressional Budget Office budget review, the federal deficit was $1.6 trillion in the first 10 months of fiscal year 2023 which is over the $726 billion deficit the federal government incurred in the same period last year according to Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office noted that federal spending was 10% higher during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2023, while tax revenues came in 10% lower, which resulted for the deficit to widen.

As that process reaches its home stretch on September 5 and 20, when the first and last readings on the issue take place, respectively, at council meetings, what can residents expect? The first point to highlight is that the community was able to see the budget projection in a workshop organized on August 15, in which each department made its presentation. It was revealed that the proposed general fund total budget for the next fiscal year is of $77,105,320. This represents a general increase of 14.14% compared to the previous year. It should be noted that, although the budget proposed in said session hasn\u2019t been approved nor has any decision been made in this regard, it\u2019s in line with the city\u2019s strategic plan. It reflects the vision that the Doral council has on how to provide a better service to the community.

Despite being a federal program, SNAP payments are administered by state governments, so eligibility conditions and amounts vary depending on the beneficiary\u2019s residence state. For families that struggle to feed their families, SNAP help provides monthly food stamps. The amount mostly relies on the circumstances of each family in addition to the size of the household.

Eligibility For SNAP Benefits Based on a 2023 analysis by the left-leaning research tank Center for Budget & Policy Priorities, households must be or lower than 130% of the poverty line set by the government to be eligible for SNAP assistance, which works out to nearly $2,500 per month for a household of three. States are crucial in identifying who is eligible for SNAP assistance and in distributing payments. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has data up to April 2023, and during that month, approximately 42 million Americans received SNAP benefits.

As that process reaches its home stretch on September 5 and 20, when the first and last readings on the issue take place, respectively, at council meetings, what can residents expect? The first point to highlight is that the community was able to see the budget projection in a workshop organized on August 15, in which each department made its presentation. It was revealed that the proposed general fund total budget for the next fiscal year is of $77,105,320. This represents a general increase of 14.14% compared to the previous year. It should be noted that, although the budget proposed in said session hasn\u2019t been approved nor has any decision been made in this regard, it\u2019s in line with the city\u2019s strategic plan. It reflects the vision that the Doral council has on how to provide a better service to the community. The budget has been impacted by the increase in the cost of living, the mileage rate that is now at 1.7166 (the lowest in the county), and the population growth. \u201cTwelve years ago, we had 45,000 residents and today, 81,000,\n6. publish date: 2023-08-18, Friday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: SNAP Benefits Texas: Americans To Recieve Upto $1600 In August\nbody: SNAP is one of the most well-known financial aid schemes in the US. Despite being a federal program, SNAP payments are administered by state governments, so eligibility conditions and amounts vary depending on the beneficiary\u2019s residence state. For families that struggle to feed their families, SNAP help provides monthly food stamps. The amount mostly relies on the circumstances of each family in addition to the size of the household. No matter how much the recipients get, the funds are transferred to an EBT debit card, that is recognized in some marketplaces and retail locations. Eligibility For SNAP Benefits Based on a 2023 analysis by the left-leaning research tank Center for Budget & Policy Priorities, households must be or lower than 130% of the poverty line set by the government to be eligible for SNAP assistance, which works out to nearly $2,500 per month for a household of three. States are crucial in identifying who is eligible for SNAP assistance and in distributing payments. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has data up to April 2023, and during that month, approximately 42 million Americans received SNAP benefits. Participants in SNAP who are capable of working and do not have a dependant must earn at least eighty hours each month to be eligible for food benefits.

When you answer the question, try to be as comprehensive as possible based on the given information\nPlease answer this Question:\nHow the U.S. budget affects poor families\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\n Based on the information provided, I can answer the question \"How the U.S. budget affects poor families.\"\n\nAccording to the information provided, the U.S. budget for 2023-2024 has been projected to be $77,105,320, which represents a 14.14% increase compared to the previous year [5]. This increase is primarily due to the rise in the cost of living, the mileage rate, and the population growth.\n\nHowever, the budget does not provide any specific provisions for poor families. In fact, the budget projections do not mention the word \"poor\" or \"low-income\" at all. This suggests that the budget does not prioritize the needs of poor families, who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nMoreover, the tax cuts proposed in the budget may actually harm poor families, as they may lose out on essential government programs and services that are funded by taxes [4]. This could exacerbate the existing income inequality and poverty issues in the country.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is difficult to say how the U.S. budget affects poor families directly. However, it is clear that the budget does not prioritize the needs of poor families and may even harm them indirectly through tax cuts and reduced government services.\n\nRelated questions that may provide more information on this topic include:\n\n* What specific programs and services are available to support poor families in the U.S.?\n* How does the U.S. budget allocation for different sectors, such as healthcare and education, affect poor families?\n* What are the potential long-term consequences of the tax cuts proposed in the U.S. budget for poor families?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, the U.S. budget has been significantly impacting poor families in various ways:\n\n- In Northern Virginia, it was reported that in 2021, 20% of families were not earning enough money for shelter, food, medical care, and other essentials. Another 9% could not afford child care in addition to these needs [1].\n- The U.S. budget has also impacted the pace of inflation which has affected families [1].\n- In Ohio, the state's new two-year budget provided tax cuts for some, but also restructured the Ohio Department of Education and attempted to change the rules for living in dorms at public universities [2].\n- The federal government\u2019s budget deficit hit $1.6 trillion in the first 10 months of fiscal year 2023 [3].\n- The next president will have to deal with a possible rewrite of tax law soon after taking office, affecting most U.S. households [4].\n- The budget for the next fiscal year, which runs between October 1st, 2023, and September 30th, 2024, has been impacted by the increase in the cost of living, the mileage rate, and the population growth [5].\n- Additionally, SNAP payments are administered by state governments and the amount of payment depends on the circumstances of the beneficiary [6].\n\nOverall, the U.S. budget has been impacting poor families in various ways, including their ability to meet basic needs, their income levels, and their access to education and healthcare. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant B provided a more comprehensive and accurate response to the user's question. Assistant B correctly identified and cited multiple sources that discuss how the U.S. budget affects poor families, including the impact on basic needs, income levels, and access to education and healthcare. On the other hand, Assistant A made an incorrect assumption that the U.S. budget for 2023-2024 was projected to be $77,105,320, which is actually the budget for the City of Doral, not the U.S. budget. Therefore, Assistant B's response is more accurate and relevant to the user's question. So, the final verdict is [[B]].", "turn": 1, "tstamp": 1695173682.3764565}

And we, frankly, had run out of service providers,\" said Healey on Monday. The Commonwealth has more than 6,000 families in emergency shelters, including pregnant mothers and children. Many have come to Massachusetts in recent months as migrants from countries such as Haiti. \"I am very focused on securing more funding from the Biden administration. I have made that specific request. Number two, I'm focused on work authorizations. All of these people want to work. We've got a workforce shortage in the state. We've got employers who are dying to get people to work,\" Healey said.

The men and women, many with children, ate Popeyes and ramen and washed their clothes in the bathroom sink. Toddlers used brooms as toys. The lucky ones slept on cots, but most made do with thin blankets spread among bags and piles of trash. Alejandra Meneces, 30, from Venezuela, said she\u2019d been waiting at O\u2019Hare with her husband and son for almost a week. \u201cWe came here for our own dignity,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we want to do more than anything is work.\u201d If the past 12 months are any indicator, it\u2019s deeply uncertain if Meneces will find either anytime soon. One year since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused the first group of asylum-seekers to Chicago \u2014 arguing that liberal northern cities that profess to be sanctuaries should welcome them \u2014 what began as political gamesmanship is now a full-blown humanitarian crisis: As of Friday, more than 6,600 migrants were lodging at city-run shelters, with another 1,576 sleeping in police stations and more than 400 camped at O\u2019Hare. More than 13,500 asylum-seekers have arrived in the past year, often with no money and few belongings. With Chicago already struggling to absorb such numbers, Mayor Brandon Johnson warned Wednesday that the city can\u2019t continue safely welcoming more migrants \u201cwithout significant support and immigration policy changes.\u201d Neighborhood resistance to shelters, both for their disruption and strain on public resources, also continues to flare up. Yet the buses from the Texas border are still showing up almost daily. A Tribune investigation of the city\u2019s response in the past year revealed a costly and at times disorganized approach, often characterized by poor planning, lack of leadership and troubling conditions in shelters\n3. publish date: 2023-09-07, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: NYC migrant crisis: Adams calls for policy changes as asylum seekers continue to arrive\nbody: At least 6 new buses with migrants arrived in New York City on Wednesday, as the city plans to open yet another large-scale humanitarian relief center this time in Long Island City. As a result, the Adams administration is once again calling for changes to a policy that requires the city to provide shelter to migrants. \"There\u2019s a wide-open front door right now,\" Deputy Mayor Anne Williams-Isom said at a press briefing. For more than a year, the city has scrambled to feed, clothe, and even educate more than 110,000 migrants who have passed through New York City since the spring of 2022. Nearly 60,000 migrants are currently in the city\u2019s care and around 19,000 migrant children are headed to city schools this week. The Adams administration argues that the right to shelter policy which requires the city to provide housing to anyone who needs it is putting the city in an impossible situation. This policy is currently being debated in court with Legal Aid and the state. \"You're going to get a hotel room, you're going to get school, open arms and while we love that, and we are so proud of that, I think in a way it's being used against us,\" Williams-Isom said. \"If we didn't have the right to shelter, I think we would still get people but I think that it would be a little less.\" The city is now opening its 16th large-scale humanitarian relief center at Austell Place in Long Island City. The city is still working on getting this building up to code, but more than 300 migrants will be moved in on Wednesday while construction will continue on the lower floors. \"At full capacity, Austell Place will be able to serve nearly 1000 people, offering not only a safe place to sleep, but also food medical care, and help from social service workers,\" HPD Commissioner Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, Jr. said.

The mayor's office said the Hyde Park hotel could house up to 300 migrants. The city is struggling with the constant influx of migrants. That hotel was chosen, in part, because it previously housed migrants earlier this year. But some neighbors say there were problems back then with noise, cleanliness, and even drug use. In Hyde Park, the spokesperson for the Office of Emergency Management said Lake Shore Hotel will house migrants. At a standing room only meeting between city officials and Hyde Park residents, there were angry words and heated confrontation over the plans. \"I don't want them there!\" said one woman. \"Take them someplace else or send them back to Venezuela! I don't care where they go!\" ABC7 Political Analyst Laura Washington has more in the efforts to help migrants in Chicago. \"This is a generous city. We are a city of immigrants,\" said another woman. \"We believe that every community should support the asylum seekers,\" another woman said. Some Hyde Park residents welcome stable options for families who have just arrived. \"I think we do have enough resources to welcome these people properly, but we have to make a decision to use our wealth that way,\" said Saba Ayman-Nolley, president of the Hyde Park Kenwood Interfaith Council. Some residents near the hotel did not want to go on camera, but are concerned about this already congested area and the unhoused residents already struggling. \"I don't say anything about taking care of other people, but you take care of your own first. Don't you? Don't you take care of you own before you take care of somebody else?\" Hyde Park resident Cornell Tyler said. Officials say the Lake Shore Hotel will be used as a shelter for six months, and the migrants staying there will be families with children, many with medical needs. The city is a step closer to buying 3034 W. Foster Ave., currently owned by the Water Reclamation District. At the last Water Reclamation Board meeting, it was discussed as a potential place to house migrants. The deal goes before the full City Council next month.

The Commonwealth currently has more than 6,000 families in emergency shelters including pregnant mothers and children [1].\n\n- In Chicago, more than 13,500 asylum-seekers have arrived in the past year, often with no money and few belongings. The city has been struggling to accommodate these migrants, and there are concerns about the neighborhood resistance to shelters, strain on public resources, and poor living conditions at shelters [3].\n\n- New York City has been receiving busloads of migrants, resulting in the need for more large-scale humanitarian relief centers. The city plans to open another one in Long Island City.

And we, frankly, had run out of service providers,\" said Healey on Monday. The Commonwealth has more than 6,000 families in emergency shelters, including pregnant mothers and children. Many have come to Massachusetts in recent months as migrants from countries such as Haiti. \"I am very focused on securing more funding from the Biden administration. I have made that specific request. Number two, I'm focused on work authorizations. All of these people want to work. We've got a workforce shortage in the state. We've got employers who are dying to get people to work,\" Healey said. Healey said a lot of the migrants are coming by flight to Boston after they are greeted by advocates in states like Texas.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-02, Saturday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: A year in, Chicago\u2019s migrant crisis exacerbated by City Hall and state delays, hefty contracts and questionable decisions\nbody: Behind a thick black curtain at O\u2019Hare International Airport where a security guard with a German shepherd stood watch, dozens of migrants sprawled on the hard tile floor, awaiting placement to Chicago-run shelters, some saying they\u2019d been there for weeks. The men and women, many with children, ate Popeyes and ramen and washed their clothes in the bathroom sink. Toddlers used brooms as toys. The lucky ones slept on cots, but most made do with thin blankets spread among bags and piles of trash. Alejandra Meneces, 30, from Venezuela, said she\u2019d been waiting at O\u2019Hare with her husband and son for almost a week. \u201cWe came here for our own dignity,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we want to do more than anything is work.\u201d If the past 12 months are any indicator, it\u2019s deeply uncertain if Meneces will find either anytime soon. One year since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused the first group of asylum-seekers to Chicago \u2014 arguing that liberal northern cities that profess to be sanctuaries should welcome them \u2014 what began as political gamesmanship is now a full-blown humanitarian crisis: As of Friday, more than 6,600 migrants were lodging at city-run shelters, with another 1,576 sleeping in police stations and more than 400 camped at O\u2019Hare. More than 13,500 asylum-seekers have arrived in the past year, often with no money and few belongings. With Chicago already struggling to absorb such numbers, Mayor Brandon Johnson warned Wednesday that the city can\u2019t continue safely welcoming more migrants \u201cwithout significant support and immigration policy changes.\u201d Neighborhood resistance to shelters, both for their disruption and strain on public resources, also continues to flare up. Yet the buses from the Texas border are still showing up almost daily. A Tribune investigation of the city\u2019s response in the past year revealed a costly and at times disorganized approach, often characterized by poor planning, lack of leadership and troubling conditions in shelters\n3. publish date: 2023-09-07, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: NYC migrant crisis: Adams calls for policy changes as asylum seekers continue to arrive\nbody: At least 6 new buses with migrants arrived in New York City on Wednesday, as the city plans to open yet another large-scale humanitarian relief center this time in Long Island City. As a result, the Adams administration is once again calling for changes to a policy that requires the city to provide shelter to migrants. \"There\u2019s a wide-open front door right now,\" Deputy Mayor Anne Williams-Isom said at a press briefing. For more than a year, the city has scrambled to feed, clothe, and even educate more than 110,000 migrants who have passed through New York City since the spring of 2022. Nearly 60,000 migrants are currently in the city\u2019s care and around 19,000 migrant children are headed to city schools this week. The Adams administration argues that the right to shelter policy which requires the city to provide housing to anyone who needs it is putting the city in an impossible situation. This policy is currently being debated in court with Legal Aid and the state. \"You're going to get a hotel room, you're going to get school, open arms and while we love that, and we are so proud of that, I think in a way it's being used against us,\" Williams-Isom said. \"If we didn't have the right to shelter, I think we would still get people but I think that it would be a little less.\" The city is now opening its 16th large-scale humanitarian relief center at Austell Place in Long Island City. The city is still working on getting this building up to code, but more than 300 migrants will be moved in on Wednesday while construction will continue on the lower floors. \"At full capacity, Austell Place will be able to serve nearly 1000 people, offering not only a safe place to sleep, but also food medical care, and help from social service workers,\" HPD Commissioner Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, Jr. said. Governor Kathy Hochul is still resisting calls from city officials to force upstate counties to house migrants.

The mayor's office said the Hyde Park hotel could house up to 300 migrants. The city is struggling with the constant influx of migrants. That hotel was chosen, in part, because it previously housed migrants earlier this year. But some neighbors say there were problems back then with noise, cleanliness, and even drug use. In Hyde Park, the spokesperson for the Office of Emergency Management said Lake Shore Hotel will house migrants. At a standing room only meeting between city officials and Hyde Park residents, there were angry words and heated confrontation over the plans. \"I don't want them there!\" said one woman. \"Take them someplace else or send them back to Venezuela! I don't care where they go!\" ABC7 Political Analyst Laura Washington has more in the efforts to help migrants in Chicago. \"This is a generous city. We are a city of immigrants,\" said another woman. \"We believe that every community should support the asylum seekers,\" another woman said. Some Hyde Park residents welcome stable options for families who have just arrived. \"I think we do have enough resources to welcome these people properly, but we have to make a decision to use our wealth that way,\" said Saba Ayman-Nolley, president of the Hyde Park Kenwood Interfaith Council. Some residents near the hotel did not want to go on camera, but are concerned about this already congested area and the unhoused residents already struggling. \"I don't say anything about taking care of other people, but you take care of your own first. Don't you? Don't you take care of you own before you take care of somebody else?\" Hyde Park resident Cornell Tyler said. Officials say the Lake Shore Hotel will be used as a shelter for six months, and the migrants staying there will be families with children, many with medical needs. The city is a step closer to buying 3034 W. Foster Ave., currently owned by the Water Reclamation District. At the last Water Reclamation Board meeting, it was discussed as a potential place to house migrants. The deal goes before the full City Council next month.

Outlaw, who made history as the first Black woman to lead Philadelphia's police force, is embarking on a new journey as the Deputy Chief Security Officer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Her departure is slated for September 22, with First Deputy Commissioner John M. Stanford, Jr. stepping in as Interim Police Commissioner. Outlaw's announcement comes after a period of significant challenges and changes in the city's landscape. She assumed her role in February 2020, taking on the immense responsibility of overseeing a department grappling with historic protests in the wake of George Floyd's killing and subsequent allegations of excessive force. This tumultuous period led to a substantial settlement payout of over $9 million to those affected by the police department's response. In recent times, the Philadelphia Police Department faced scrutiny for its handling of high-profile cases, including the police shooting of Eddie Jose Irizarry and a misdirected response prior to a mass shooting in the Kingsessing neighborhood. These incidents, coupled with a surge in carjackings and gun crimes, placed additional pressure on Outlaw's leadership. Despite these challenges, Outlaw's time as commissioner was marked by a commitment to reform, a dedication Mayor Jim Kenney acknowledged in his statement. Outlaw herself commended the hard work and professionalism of her department, emphasizing their adaptability and resilience in the face of adversity.

Her last day as Police Commissioner will be September 22, 2023. Mayor Kenney has appointed First Deputy John M. Stanford, Jr. as Interim Police Commissioner upon her departure. In her statement, Commissioner Outlaw expressed appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the department's officers, noting their resilience in the face of adversity and their success in achieving milestones under her leadership. She highlighted their efforts in meeting the goals of the Crime Prevention and Violence Reduction Action Plan that was developed and shared with the public within three months of her appointment, including crime reduction, improved clearance rates, reduced complaints against police, and increased diversity in hiring and promotions. Commissioner Outlaw concluded by expressing gratitude for everyone's service to all: \"It has been my honor and privilege to serve alongside each of you as the leader of the Philadelphia Police Department...Together, we have proven that we are unbreakable, as we have endured the most challenging times in the chronicles of policing.\" Mayor Kenney thanked Commissioner Outlaw for her service: \"Danielle has been an exemplary leader during an unprecedented period for our city...Her unwavering commitment to justice reform and community engagement will continue to impact Philadelphia long after she departs office.\"\n3. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Philadelphia police commissioner resigns after turbulent three years\nbody: Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw will step down this month to help lead a New York-area transit system, the mayor said Tuesday, ending a turbulent three years in which she guided one of the country\u2019s largest police forces through pandemic lockdowns, Black Lives Matter protests and frequent turmoil over race and policing. Outlaw, the first Black woman to run the 6,000-member department, came aboard just before the pandemic shutdown and quickly had to oversee the city's safety as intense protests broke out in Philadelphia and across the country in the summer of 2020 over the police killing of Black people. Her resignation comes just a few months before the end of Mayor Jim Kenney\u2019s tenure and as the rates of homicides and other crimes have become a major issue in the race to replace him. She will soon start a top security position with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Tensions between Philadelphia police and the public escalated after George Floyd\u2019s killing in May 2020, when mostly peaceful protesters who shut down a major city expressway were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. The City Council issued a statement calling the police response \u201cbrutal,\u201d \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cunacceptable,\u201d but Outlaw initially defended the strategy. The city later paid a $9.25-million settlement to hundreds of protesters. Later that year, police came under rebuke again when a young Black man named Walter Wallace Jr., who had a history of mental illness and was brandishing a knife outside his home, was shot and killed within seconds of police arriving to the scene. Outlaw bemoaned the lack of mental health services while pledging the department would do better. And they came to a head again just last month, when the department had to backtrack to say that a man who was killed by an officer who had stopped him for erratic driving had neither lunged at police with a knife nor exited the car, as police officials initially claimed. Outlaw moved to fire the officer for insubordination and other alleged policy violations in the Aug. 14 death of Eddie Irizarry. \u201cCommissioner Outlaw has worked relentlessly for three and a half years during an unprecedented era in our city and a number of crisis situations, and she deserves praise for her commitment to bring long-overdue reform to the Department after years of racism and gender discrimination prior to her appointment,\u201d Kenney said in a statement.

[1] Her resignation comes amid a period of significant challenges for the city's law enforcement, including the pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, and frequent turmoil over race and policing. [3] Outlaw has been praised for her commitment to reform and her dedication to the department's officers, but her departure has been met with criticism from some community members who feel that she did not do enough to address issues of police brutality and systemic racism. [2]\n\nAs the city navigates this transition, it remains to be seen who will be chosen to lead the department and steer its future course. [1] The city's mayor, Jim Kenney, has appointed First Deputy John M. Stanford, Jr. as interim police commissioner, but the long-term leadership of the department is still uncertain. [3]\n\nIn light of this information, it is difficult to provide a more comprehensive answer to the question of why the police commissioner resigned, as the provided information does not provide a clear reason for her departure. However, it is clear that Outlaw's tenure was marked by significant challenges and controversies, and her resignation comes at a time of ongoing debate and concern about police reform and accountability in Philadelphia.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nPhiladelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw has recently announced her resignation from the position. Here are some key details:\n\n- Her tenure as the city's top law enforcement officer spanned nearly four years, making her the first Black woman to lead Philadelphia's police force.\n- Outlaw's resignation is scheduled for September 22, 2023.\n- She assumed the role in February 2020, just before the pandemic shutdown, and had to oversee the city's safety during intense protests over race and policing.\n- Outlaw faced significant challenges, including the police response to the George Floyd protests, the police shooting of Eddie Jose Irizarry, and the misdirected response prior to a mass shooting in the Kingsessing neighborhood. \n- Despite these challenges, Outlaw's tenure was marked by a commitment to reform and a dedication to community engagement.\n- Upon her departure, First Deputy Commissioner John M. Stanford, Jr. will step in as Interim Police Commissioner.\n\nFor more specific details about the reasons for her resignation and the future of the Philadelphia Police Department, I would recommend further reading of the sources. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant B provides a more accurate and comprehensive response to the user's question.

The U.S. Border Patrol arrested at least 91,000 migrants who crossed as part of a family group in August, exceeding the prior one-month record of 84,486 set in May 2019, during the Trump administration. Families were the single largest demographic group crossing the border in August, surpassing single adults for the first time since Biden took office. Overall, the data show, border apprehensions have risen more than 30 percent for two consecutive months, after falling sharply in May and June as the Biden administration rolled out new restrictions and entry opportunities.

According to a report by Axios, Trump is advocating for ideological screenings to prevent communists from entering the country. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration reforms are not just about ideology, but also about ensuring those who come to the U.S. legally do not become a burden on the nation. He proposes to restrict immigrants from countries with high visa overstay rates from accessing the immigration system. Additionally, he wants to require applicants for immigration programs to demonstrate their ability to afford health insurance and expensive bonds before they can enter the country. The former president\u2019s plans extend beyond these measures. He is also considering the creation of a maritime blockade in American and Latin American waters to curb drug smuggling.

While asylum seekers are granted permission to come to the U.S. to await their hearings, new numbers show the concrete jungle is running out of space to provide resources and shelter.

It wasn\u2019t long before the state of Texas and other surrounding states began busing migrants to the sanctuary city.

This time, he\u2019s taking aim at immigration policies, specifically targeting Marxists seeking to immigrate to the United States. According to a report by Axios, Trump is advocating for ideological screenings to prevent communists from entering the country. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration reforms are not just about ideology, but also about ensuring those who come to the U.S. legally do not become a burden on the nation. He proposes to restrict immigrants from countries with high visa overstay rates from accessing the immigration system. Additionally, he wants to require applicants for immigration programs to demonstrate their ability to afford health insurance and expensive bonds before they can enter the country. The former president\u2019s plans extend beyond these measures. He is also considering the creation of a maritime blockade in American and Latin American waters to curb drug smuggling. His strategy includes reinstating his previous travel ban on certain Middle Eastern and African countries and designating drug cartels as \u201cunlawful enemy combatants.\u201d Trump\u2019s focus on border security is particularly evident in his plans for the southern border.

While asylum seekers are granted permission to come to the U.S. to await their hearings, new numbers show the concrete jungle is running out of space to provide resources and shelter. The rise in numbers of people crossing the U.S. Mexico border comes after the expiration of Title 42 in May 2023 \u2013 a public health law that was intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It wasn\u2019t long before the state of Texas and other surrounding states began busing migrants to the sanctuary city.

The decision came after a House gallery protest, ignited when Republicans didn't allow Zephyr to partake in bill debates. This incident highlighted the challenges faced by the Missoula Democrat Representative and prompted protestors in the gallery to chant 'let her speak.' This occurred during a pronouns bill discussion, which Zephyr and her backers saw as an affront to the LGBTQ+ community. Previously, Zephyr caught attention with her statement that advocates of a gender-affirming care ban could be 'accountable for potential tragic outcomes.' As a result, she was barred from the House floor by Republican lawmakers, left to oversee voting and discussions from outside the chambers. This stirred conversations about conduct in politics and triggered a surge of anti-LGBTQ+ bills across the nation. The dismissal of the charges brought relief to supporters. Zephyr was pleased with the outcome and highlighted the enduring solidarity that fought to protect democracy.

Seven people were arrested for protesting this decision [1].\n- The county attorney decided not to pursue misdemeanor trespassing charges against these protesters. The charges were dismissed in the interest of justice [1].\n- Zephyr is known for her advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community and has faced criticism for her stance on gender-affirming care [1].\n- Zooey Zephyr is not the only transgender person facing discrimination in Montana. Four states in the US, including Montana, have enacted laws limiting the definition of \"sex\" to a permanent category of \"male\" or \"female,\" which could potentially exclude transgender people from public life [2].\n- Despite the challenges, Zephyr and her supporters have continued to advocate for the LGBTQ+ community and democracy [1].\n\nPlease note that while this information provides a brief overview of the situation faced by Zooey Zephyr and other transgender individuals in Montana, it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues surrounding transgender rights and representation in politics. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information provided, there have been several news articles related to a transgender legislator in Montana, specifically Zooey Zephyr.

The decision came after a House gallery protest, ignited when Republicans didn't allow Zephyr to partake in bill debates. This incident highlighted the challenges faced by the Missoula Democrat Representative and prompted protestors in the gallery to chant 'let her speak.' This occurred during a pronouns bill discussion, which Zephyr and her backers saw as an affront to the LGBTQ+ community. Previously, Zephyr caught attention with her statement that advocates of a gender-affirming care ban could be 'accountable for potential tragic outcomes.' As a result, she was barred from the House floor by Republican lawmakers, left to oversee voting and discussions from outside the chambers. This stirred conversations about conduct in politics and triggered a surge of anti-LGBTQ+ bills across the nation. The dismissal of the charges brought relief to supporters. Zephyr was pleased with the outcome and highlighted the enduring solidarity that fought to protect democracy.

According to [1], Zephyr was silenced by Republican lawmakers during a debate on a pronouns bill, which sparked protests and drew national attention. The protesters were arrested, but the charges were later dropped [2]. Zephyr has been a vocal advocate for the LGBTQ+ community and has faced opposition from conservative lawmakers [3].\n\nAs a smart AI assistant, I cannot provide information on the current status of Zephyr's legislative activities or any recent developments, as the most recent information available is from August 2023. However, I suggest related questions that might be of interest to the user, such as:\n\n* What is the current status of the pronouns bill that was debated during Zephyr's silencing?\n* How has the silencing of Zephyr and the protests that ensued affected the LGBTQ+ community in Montana?\n* What other states have enacted laws or policies that impact the rights of transgender individuals, and how do these compare to Montana's laws?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nBased on the information I found, a transgender lawmaker named Zooey Zephyr is a Democratic representative from Missoula, Montana. Here are some key points:\n\n- Zooey Zephyr faced discrimination when she was denied the right to speak on a bill in the state House gallery. Seven people were arrested for protesting this decision [1].\n- The county attorney decided not to pursue misdemeanor trespassing charges against these protesters. The charges were dismissed in the interest of justice [1].\n- Zephyr is known for her advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community and has faced criticism for her stance on gender-affirming care [1].\n- Zooey Zephyr is not the only transgender person facing discrimination in Montana. Four states in the US, including Montana, have enacted laws limiting the definition of \"sex\" to a permanent category of \"male\" or \"female,\" which could potentially exclude transgender people from public life [2].\n- Despite the challenges, Zephyr and her supporters have continued to advocate for the LGBTQ+ community and democracy [1].\n\nPlease note that while this information provides a brief overview of the situation faced by Zooey Zephyr and other transgender individuals in Montana, it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues surrounding transgender rights and representation in politics. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant B provides a more comprehensive and detailed response to the user's question about the transgender legislator in Montana. It includes key points about Zooey Zephyr's experiences, the protests that occurred, the dismissal of charges against the protesters, and the broader context of discrimination against transgender individuals in Montana and other states. Assistant A, on the other hand, provides a less detailed response and suggests related questions, which is not allowed according to the rules.

The ETI is a reliable employment index. If it increases, we can expect more jobs, but a decrease suggests fewer jobs. The index has been falling since March 2022, hinting at possible changes in job numbers. Selcuk Eren, a Senior Economist at The Conference Board, stated that despite the fall, the Index is still high. This suggests that job growth may continue, but at a slower pace. Eren noted that some sectors, such as information services and transportation, are already losing jobs. The August ETI suggests that job losses could spread to other sectors. For example, there's been a consistent drop in temporary help services employment, a sign of hiring trends. Job openings are also decreasing, although they're still higher than before the pandemic. Consumer sentiment reflects a slowing job market, with more consumers finding jobs hard to get. Despite this, wages are still higher than before the pandemic. This could lead to inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, possibly causing job losses and higher unemployment in 2024. The ETI's August drop was due to negative contributions from six of its eight components. These include the Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find 'Jobs Hard to Get', the Ratio of Involuntarily Part-time to All Part-time Workers, the Percentage of Firms with Positions Not Able to Fill, the Number of Employees Hired by Temporary-Help Industry, Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance, and Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales.

The 32-year-old adventurer from Castle Pines, Colorado, went missing during a solo hiking trip, leaving his family in distress as they awaited news of his whereabouts. The Mysterious Disappearance The journey into the wilderness began on a seemingly ordinary day in late August. Adam Fuselier, an experienced hiker with a passion for exploration, embarked on a solo adventure in Glacier National Park. With the beauty of Montana's rugged terrain stretching before him, he set his sights on Reynolds Mountain, a challenging climb even for seasoned hikers. August 29 marked the last contact Adam had with his family. As the afternoon sun cast long shadows over the mountains, they received his final communication. Little did they know that this would be the last time they heard from their beloved son and brother. A Desperate Wait Days passed, and Adam did not return from his expedition. Concern turned into panic as his family realized that something was amiss. On the following day, park rangers were alerted about an overdue hiker named Adam Fuselier. It was at this moment that the search for the missing adventurer began. An Ominous Discovery The search kicked off on a daunting note as teams of park rangers ventured into the wilderness. The weather did them no favours, with fog, rain, and gusty winds complicating their efforts. Adam's vehicle served as a chilling clue to his last-known location, as it was found parked at Logan Pass, the highest point in the park accessible by car. As days turned into nights, hope began to wane, and the situation grew dire. The treacherous terrain and unpredictable weather conditions only added to the urgency of the search. The dedicated searchers, undeterred by the challenging circumstances, pressed on with their mission to find the missing hiker. A Bittersweet Ending Finally, after days of relentless searching, the ordeal came to a sombre conclusion. The search crews made a heartbreaking discovery: the lifeless body of Adam Fuselier was found on Reynolds Mountain. It was a moment that no one had hoped for, yet it was the closure his family desperately needed. The search efforts were nothing short of herculean, involving more than 50 searchers, a skilled dog team, and the assistance of two helicopters. Credible tips from fellow hikers who had crossed paths with Adam played a crucial role in narrowing down the search area, eventually leading to the discovery of his remains.

Get used to it, experts say, as both the heat and the smoke are likely here to stay. Thanks to the ongoing wildfires in Canada, which show no sign of ending, smoky air is set to be a regular, periodic occurrence down here in the U.S. throughout the rest of the summer, experts said. \"As long as those fires keep burning up there, that\u2019s going to be a problem for us,\" said Weather Prediction Center forecast operations chief Greg Carbin. \"As long as there\u2019s something to burn, there will be smoke we have to deal with.\" And as for the heat , if you're sick of it already, there's not much relief in sight: Federal forecasters are predicting a warmer-than-average summer for most of the country. Smoke risk not likely to ease soon, thanks to stuck pattern An unusually persistent, stuck weather pattern, which continues to periodically funnel foul, smoke-filled air over U.S. cities from Chicago to Washington, shows no sign of changing or letting up. \"While the fires are ongoing, you can expect to see these periodic bad air days,\" said University of Chicago atmospheric scientist Liz Moyer. \"And the only relief is either when the fires go out or when the weather pattern dies.\" In addition, the wildfire forecast from Canada remains grim: Current projections indicate the potential for continued \"higher-than-normal fire activity across most of the country throughout the 2023 wildland fire season, due to ongoing drought and long-range forecasts for warm temperatures,\" according to Natural Resources Canada . Hot forecast for the rest of summer 2023 A hot summer also seems likely, meteorologists say.

Last month was not only the hottest August scientists ever recorded by far with modern equipment, it was also the second hottest month measured, behind only July 2023, WMO and the European climate service Copernicus announced Wednesday. August was about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial averages. That is the threshold that the world is trying not to pass, though scientists are more concerned about rises in temperatures over decades, not merely a blip over a month\u2019s time. The world\u2019s oceans \u2014 more than 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface \u2014 were the hottest ever recorded, nearly 21 C (69.8 F), and have set high temperature marks for three consecutive months, the WMO and Copernicus said. \u201cThe dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. \u201cClimate breakdown has begun.\u201d So far, 2023 is the second hottest year on record, behind 2016, according to Copernicus. Scientists blame ever warming human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas with an extra push from a natural El Nino, which is a temporary warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. Usually an El Nino, which started earlier this year, adds extra heat to global temperatures but more so in its second year. Climatologist Andrew Weaver said the numbers announced by WMO and Copernicus come as no surprise, bemoaning how governments have not appeared to take the issue of global warming seriously enough. He expressed concern that the public will just forget the issue when temperatures fall again. \u201cIt\u2019s time for global leaders to start telling the truth,\u201d said Weaver, a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria in Canada. \u201cWe will not limit warming to 1.5 C; we will not limit warming to\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: Dangerous heat wave hits eastern US: Latest forecast\nbody: This week might bring the first heat wave of the season for New York City.

Thanks to the ongoing wildfires in Canada, which show no sign of ending, smoky air is set to be a regular, periodic occurrence down here in the U.S. throughout the rest of the summer, experts said. \"As long as those fires keep burning up there, that\u2019s going to be a problem for us,\" said Weather Prediction Center forecast operations chief Greg Carbin. \"As long as there\u2019s something to burn, there will be smoke we have to deal with.\" And as for the heat , if you're sick of it already, there's not much relief in sight: Federal forecasters are predicting a warmer-than-average summer for most of the country. Smoke risk not likely to ease soon, thanks to stuck pattern An unusually persistent, stuck weather pattern, which continues to periodically funnel foul, smoke-filled air over U.S. cities from Chicago to Washington, shows no sign of changing or letting up. \"While the fires are ongoing, you can expect to see these periodic bad air days,\" said University of Chicago atmospheric scientist Liz Moyer. \"And the only relief is either when the fires go out or when the weather pattern dies.\" In addition, the wildfire forecast from Canada remains grim: Current projections indicate the potential for continued \"higher-than-normal fire activity across most of the country throughout the 2023 wildland fire season, due to ongoing drought and long-range forecasts for warm temperatures,\" according to Natural Resources Canada . Hot forecast for the rest of summer 2023 A hot summer also seems likely, meteorologists say. Specifically, above-normal temperatures are expected throughout a majority of the U.S. during July, August and September, according to Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Brad Pugh. Pugh said the highest probabilities of above-normal temperatures are forecast across parts of California, the Pacific Northwest, the Great Basin, the Southwest, the Gulf Coast and the\n3. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: August caps deadly summer that broke global records for heat, meteorologists say\nbody: GENEVA (AP) \u2014 Earth has sweltered through its hottest Northern Hemisphere summer ever measured, with a record warm August capping a season of brutal and deadly temperatures, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Last month was not only the hottest August scientists ever recorded by far with modern equipment, it was also the second hottest month measured, behind only July 2023, WMO and the European climate service Copernicus announced Wednesday. August was about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial averages. That is the threshold that the world is trying not to pass, though scientists are more concerned about rises in temperatures over decades, not merely a blip over a month\u2019s time. The world\u2019s oceans \u2014 more than 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface \u2014 were the hottest ever recorded, nearly 21 C (69.8 F), and have set high temperature marks for three consecutive months, the WMO and Copernicus said. \u201cThe dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. \u201cClimate breakdown has begun.\u201d So far, 2023 is the second hottest year on record, behind 2016, according to Copernicus. Scientists blame ever warming human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas with an extra push from a natural El Nino, which is a temporary warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. Usually an El Nino, which started earlier this year, adds extra heat to global temperatures but more so in its second year. Climatologist Andrew Weaver said the numbers announced by WMO and Copernicus come as no surprise, bemoaning how governments have not appeared to take the issue of global warming seriously enough. He expressed concern that the public will just forget the issue when temperatures fall again. \u201cIt\u2019s time for global leaders to start telling the truth,\u201d said Weaver, a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria in Canada. \u201cWe will not limit warming to 1.5 C; we will not limit warming to\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: Dangerous heat wave hits eastern US: Latest forecast\nbody: This week might bring the first heat wave of the season for New York City.

They went 3-0 in group play, with their most recent victory coming over Jordan, 110-62. With their undefeated record in group play, Team USA now moves on to the second round. Many fans have wondered if the American team would have as much success as usual at the FIBA World Cup. Team USA has won five FIBA World Cup titles (tied for the most ever), but the 2023 didn\u2019t have as much star NBA talent as usual. Still, the Americans have dominated their opponents so far, seemingly proving doubters wrong. So, who are the players on Team USA that are putting up these big games? Here is Team USA\u2019s roster in the FIBA World Cup. All FIBA World Cup statistics are from the FIBA website. Paolo Banchero, PF, Orlando Magic The 2023 rookie of the year, Paolo Banchero, is showing that his scoring ability translates to international play. In three FIBA World Cup games, he has averaged 12.3 points and 3.7 rebounds. Banchero was the number one overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft because of his scoring prowess. He can score at all three levels but thrives in the mid-range as an isolation scorer or down low because of his incredible strength and ability to punish smaller defenders. Mikal Bridges, SF, Brooklyn Nets A starter for Team USA, Bridges was known more as a super-role player in his first few years with the Phoenix Suns. He is lanky, plays stifling defense, and hits open three-pointers. It wasn\u2019t until he was traded to the Nets that the forward showed he had even more in his game. He averaged 26.1 points per game after the trade last season after showcasing more self-creation and isolation ability. Through three games in the FIBA World Cup, Bridges has 8.3 points per game.

The release of this update comes after Senator McConnell appeared to freeze in front of cameras for the second time in as many months, raising questions about his condition and ability to continue leading the Senate Republican Conference. The note, provided by Brian Monahan, the Capitol Hill attending physician, offers insight into Senator McConnell's health condition, emphasizing that there is no evidence of a stroke, seizure disorder, or movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease. This information is reassuring to many who were worried about the senator's health following his recent public episodes. Previously, Senator McConnell's office had attributed these two instances of freezing to \"lightheadedness. Dr. Monahan's note elaborates on this by indicating that it is \"not uncommon\" for individuals recovering from a concussion to experience lightheadedness. It's worth noting that Senator McConnell suffered a concussion and broken ribs in March after a fall at a Washington hotel, which resulted in him hitting his head. This incident had sidelined him from Senate activities for nearly six weeks, and his recent episodes raised concerns about the lingering effects of that injury. The release of this health update couldn't have come at a more crucial time, as the Senate resumed its session following a five-week recess. During this period, speculation and questions arose among GOP senators about whether Senator McConnell could continue leading the Republican Conference effectively. His tenure of 16 years as a party leader in the Senate marks a significant milestone in the chamber's history, making his health a matter of heightened interest and concern. Senator McConnell, despite the uncertainties surrounding his health, is determined to fulfill his leadership responsibilities. He is expected to address Senate business during floor remarks scheduled after the chamber's opening at 3 p.m. ET. Additionally, he plans to convene with his leadership team at 5 p.m., marking the first meeting of its kind since the summer break. The health of a Senate leader is always a matter of national importance, and in Senator McConnell's case, his extended tenure as the Republican leader has made him a central figure in American politics. The recent health update offers some reassurance, but it also underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and support to ensure that he can continue his role effectively. As the Senate reconvenes, the nation will be watching closely to see how Senator McConnell manages both his health and the political challenges that lie ahead.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s office releases new health update after second frozen moment\nbody: WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's health episodes show \"no evidence\" of being a stroke or seizure disorder, the Capitol physician said in a letter on Tuesday, offering little further explanation for the apparent freeze-ups that have drawn concerns about the 81-year-old's situation. McConnell's office released the letter from attending physician Brian P. Monahan as the Senate returns from an extended summer break and questions mount over the long-serving Republican leader's health. The GOP leader froze up last week during a press conference in Kentucky, unable to respond to a question, the second such episode in a month. \"There is no evidence that you have a seizure disorder or that you experienced a stroke, TIA or movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease,\" Monahan wrote, using the acronym for a transient ischemic attack, a brief stroke. The doctor said the assessments entailed several medical evaluations including a brain MRI imaging and \"consultations with several neurologists for a comprehensive neurology assessment.\" The evaluations come after McConnell fell and suffered a concussion earlier this year. \"There are no changes recommended in treatment protocols as you continue recovery from your March 2023 fall,\" the doctor said. After last week's freeze-up, the attending physician to Congress cleared McConnell to continue with his planned schedule. McConnell arrived Tuesday at the Capitol office. But the episodes have fueled quiet concern among Republican senators and intense speculation in Washington about McConnell's ability to remain as leader. The long-serving senator fell and hit his head at a political dinner this year, suffering the concussion. It all comes amid a swirl of health concerns in Washington, particularly as COVID-19 cases show signs of rising heading into fall. First lady Jill Biden tested positive for COVID-19 over the weekend, but President Joe Biden tested negative. Nevertheless, many Republican allies have flocked to McConnell's side, ensuring the famously guarded leader a well of support. Rivals have muted any calls for a direct challenge to McConnell's leadership. McConnell is expected to address the Senate as it opens for a flurry of fall activity, most notably the need for Congress to approve funding to prevent any interruption in federal operations by Sept. 30, which is the end of the fiscal year. Some House Republicans are willing to shut down the government at the end of the month if they are unable to enact steep spending restrictions they are fighting for that go beyond the agreement Biden reached with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this summer. In leading Senate Republicans, McConnell is viewed by the White House and Democrats as a potentially more pragmatic broker who is more interested in avoiding a messy government shutdown that could be politically damaging to the GOP.

ESPN Stats & Info noted Gauff is the first American teenager to reach the U.S. Open semifinals since Serena Williams in 2001. Gauff was one of five American-born players (men and women) who reached the quarterfinals, most in the U.S. Open since 2017. That was also the last time an American woman won this tournament (Sloane Stephens). This is already the best season of Gauff's young career. She has 39 singles match wins and three tournament victories. The Florida native had more singles titles in 2023 than she had in the previous four years combined (two). A Grand Slam title is the only thing Gauff hasn't won this year. She reached the quarterfinals at the French Open before losing to No. 1 seed Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in straight sets. Gauff's previous best finish at the U.S. Open was a quarterfinal appearance last year. She lost in straight sets to Caroline Garcia. In addition to her singles run, Gauff is also chasing a doubles title with partner Jessica Pegula.

Coco Gauff continued her impressive form on Tuesday, taking down Latvian Jelena Ostapenko in the quarterfinals, 6-0, 6-2. Dominant, to say the least. Gauff already became the first American teenager to make back-to-back US Open quarters since Serena Williams and after this latest win, the Florida native put herself in the company of the GOAT once again: 22 years later, Coco makes US Open history again. You love to see it. The 19-year-old is flying high at the moment. She just won the Cincinnati Open after beating Karolina Muchova in the final and also made the quarterfinals in Montreal before losing to Jessica Pegula. When it comes to this current tournament, however, Gauff is thriving. She\u2019s only dropped three sets in total and completely overmatched Ostapenko, who just shocked Iga Swiatek, who will now lose her No. 1 ranking after the final major of the year. Coco Gauff got revenge too considering the Latvian beat her in the fourth round of the Aussie Open this year, too. It took the American a mere 68 minutes to finish the match up, with Ostapenko holding serve just once. \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d Gauff said during her on-court interview . \u201cLast\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Coco Gauff is the 1st US teen since Serena Williams to reach consecutive US Open quarterfinals\nbody: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff is the first American teen since Serena Williams more than two decades ago to reach the U.S. Open quarterfinals two years in a row, so the 19-year-old from Florida knows her way out of trouble on a tennis court. As the second set slipped away against Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round Sunday at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Gauff needed a chance to think things through after handing over a break with a pair of double-faults and a stumble that left her doing the splits. So Gauff turned in the direction of the near-constant chatter coming from Brad Gilbert, one of her two coaches sitting in a front-row seat, and said, \u201cPlease stop.\u201d A couple of minutes later, Gauff said, \u201cStop talking.\u201d That was while Wozniacki was grabbing four consecutive games to go up a break in the third set. And then, just as the match seemed to be slipping away thanks in part to a slew of unforced errors, Gauff straightened out her strokes and pulled way. She collected the last six games for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 victory over Wozniacki, the 33-year-old mother of two who recently came out of retirement. \u201cI was getting frustrated.

ESPN Stats & Info noted Gauff is the first American teenager to reach the U.S. Open semifinals since Serena Williams in 2001. Gauff was one of five American-born players (men and women) who reached the quarterfinals, most in the U.S. Open since 2017. That was also the last time an American woman won this tournament (Sloane Stephens). This is already the best season of Gauff's young career. She has 39 singles match wins and three tournament victories. The Florida native had more singles titles in 2023 than she had in the previous four years combined (two). A Grand Slam title is the only thing Gauff hasn't won this year. She reached the quarterfinals at the French Open before losing to No. 1 seed Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in straight sets. Gauff's previous best finish at the U.S. Open was a quarterfinal appearance last year. She lost in straight sets to Caroline Garcia. In addition to her singles run, Gauff is also chasing a doubles title with partner Jessica Pegula.

Coco Gauff continued her impressive form on Tuesday, taking down Latvian Jelena Ostapenko in the quarterfinals, 6-0, 6-2. Dominant, to say the least. Gauff already became the first American teenager to make back-to-back US Open quarters since Serena Williams and after this latest win, the Florida native put herself in the company of the GOAT once again: 22 years later, Coco makes US Open history again. You love to see it. The 19-year-old is flying high at the moment. She just won the Cincinnati Open after beating Karolina Muchova in the final and also made the quarterfinals in Montreal before losing to Jessica Pegula. When it comes to this current tournament, however, Gauff is thriving. She\u2019s only dropped three sets in total and completely overmatched Ostapenko, who just shocked Iga Swiatek, who will now lose her No. 1 ranking after the final major of the year. Coco Gauff got revenge too considering the Latvian beat her in the fourth round of the Aussie Open this year, too. It took the American a mere 68 minutes to finish the match up, with Ostapenko holding serve just once. \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d Gauff said during her on-court interview . \u201cLast\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Coco Gauff is the 1st US teen since Serena Williams to reach consecutive US Open quarterfinals\nbody: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff is the first American teen since Serena Williams more than two decades ago to reach the U.S. Open quarterfinals two years in a row, so the 19-year-old from Florida knows her way out of trouble on a tennis court.
