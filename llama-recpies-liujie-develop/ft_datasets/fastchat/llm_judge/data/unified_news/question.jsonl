Here's why and some background about his case\nbody: Dennis Rader, the BTK serial killer whose self-given nickname stands for \u201cBind, Torture, Kill,\u201d played a cat and mouse game with investigators and reporters for decades before he was caught. But Rader gradually faded from view after his 2005 arrest, as he served one life term for each of the 10 people he was convicted of killing. He made headlines again this week, though, because he was named the prime suspect in an Oklahoma teen\u2019s 1976 disappearance and a Missouri woman\u2019s 1990 killing.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-02, Saturday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Law enforcement seeks help to identify barns in BTK serial killer cold case investigations\nbody: (CNN) \u2014 A law enforcement team in northeast Oklahoma believes the prolific serial killer known as \u201cBTK\u201d may be responsible for several additional unsolved missing person and homicide cases. Now they\u2019re hoping the public can help them identify barns and silos in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri that the self-proclaimed BTK killer Dennis Rader sketched in never-before-seen detailed drawings. Last month, the Osage County Sheriff\u2019s Office publicly confirmed it was investigating Rader as the \u201cprime suspect\u201d in a 1976 cold case in their jurisdiction and several other unsolved crimes across three states. The investigators believe the killer may have buried 16-year-old Cynthia Dawn Kinney in a barn near the Kansas-Oklahoma border. Kinney was last seen at a laundromat in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, in 1976. Her body has never been found. CNN obtained images of Rader\u2019s drawings, which were first recovered by law enforcement after his arrest in 2005. Rader pleaded guilty to 10 murders that took place from the 1970s to the 1990s in Wichita, Kansas, for which he\u2019s serving 10 consecutive life sentences in a state prison. He suggested in a letter found long before his capture that he should be called \u201cBTK,\u201d short for \u201cbind, torture, kill.\u201d In recent prison interviews, Rader told Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden and other local area authorities he did not commit any other murders. An attorney for the serial killer declined to comment to CNN. CNN\u2019s Jean Casarez sat down with Sheriff Virden for an exclusive interview about Rader\u2019\n3. publish date: 2023-09-03, Sunday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Kansas BTK serial killer a suspect in Oklahoma cold cases; police seek public\u2019s help\nbody: The notorious BTK serial killer is suspected in decades-old crimes in Oklahoma, and law enforcement there wants the public\u2019s help solving them. Never-before seen drawings from BTK, showing barns and silos in the backgrounds of torture scenes, may hold the key to identifying the cases that involve a missing person and other homicides, CNN reports. BTK \u2014 whose real name is Dennis Rader \u2014 is under investigation in the 1976 disappearance of 16-year-old Cynthia Dawn Kinney and several other unsolved cases, said the Osage County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Kinney was last seen in 1976 at a laundromat in Pawkhuska, a northern Oklahoma town. Law enforcement is asking the public to help identify the barns and silos in areas across Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri possibly involved in Kinney\u2019s disappearance and BTK\u2019s other crimes . Rader says the 10 homicides in the Wichita, Kan. area which he\u2019s admitted committing from the 1970s to the 1990s are all the only ones he was involved in. He\u2019s serving 10 consecutive life sentences in those cases, and his earliest release date is in 2180. But Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden \u2014 who has recently interviewed Rader \u2014 hopes that the trove of sketches, which authorities obtained after his 2005 arrest, will help prove otherwise. The drawings obtained by CNN show several of Rader\u2019s victims. Authorities also say that recent communication was intercepted from Rader leads them to believe there may be some hidden items in old barns.

Since the Osage County Sheriff's Office began looking into potential connections between Rader and Cynthia Dawn Kinney, a 16-year-old Pawhuska girl who vanished from her aunt and uncle's laundromat in 1976, detectives have unearthed tips, leads and new evidence. In August, Osage investigators revealed a BTK journal entry about victimizing \"a girl or lady\" in a laundromat he planned to call \"Bad Wash Day.\" Investigators hope to continue raking in clues with the release of several of the killer's sketches, recovered from his notes after his arrest in 2005.

Cloud was 25 years old and mourning the loss of his father at the time. Cloud was best known for his work on the hit TV show Euphoria where he played Fezco, a drug dealer who took care of his younger brother, Ashtray (Javon Walton).

Despite being only 25, the youngster was well-known and considered one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. Following the news of Euphoria actor Angus Cloud\u2019s demise, there were speculations that he might have taken his life. However, two weeks after the tragic news, new details about Cloud\u2019s death have come to light. According to reports, the Hollywood star may have died from an accidental drug overdose. New Findings About Angus Cloud\u2019s Demise Revealed The circumstances surrounding Angus Cloud\u2019s death are yet to be confirmed, but there are reasons to believe the actor may have overdosed. Recall that after the news of Cloud\u2019s passing broke, a statement from the family hinted at suicide as the cause of death. However, a few days later, Cloud\u2019s mother, Lisa, denied the claims, insisting that her son didn\u2019t take his life. According to the grieving mom, she and Cloud spoke over the phone the day before he died, and the promising actor sounded well. Lisa explained that Cloud even talked about the future, helping family members and reorganizing his room. Lisa further explained that she didn\u2019t know what Cloud took after their conversation. However, the young man placed his head on the desk where he was working, fell asleep, and never woke up. She then noted that it was obvious Cloud didn\u2019t want to die, adding that he may have overdosed. A few details after Lisa\u2019s claims, it appears her theory may be validated. According to reports from multiple Law enforcement sources, Euphoria actor Angus Cloud didn\u2019t leave behind a suicide note for loved ones when he died. To them, it is great evidence that Angus Cloud\u2019s death could be due to an accidental overdose and not suicide. However, nothing is confirmed yet as the toxicology results and autopsy are pending. Inside Angus Cloud\u2019s Death On July 31, 2023, the Oakland Fire Department responded to a 911 call from Cloud\u2019s family home for a possible overdose. But sadly, upon arrival, Euphoria actor Angus Cloud was found lifeless in his bedroom in Oakland, California. The following day, the family confirmed the news of Angus Cloud\u2019s death via a statement. They noted that the deceased was an artist, a friend, a brother, a son, and an incredible human. The family also opened up about how Cloud struggled with losing his dad. According to the statement, Cloud battled with his mental health but remained open about it. The family concluded by asking for privacy, adding that they hoped the actor would be remembered for his humor, laughter, and love for everyone.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Decoding The Key Race Metric\nbody: In the high-speed world of Formula 1 racing, every fraction of a second counts. One important concept used to measure the performance of drivers and teams is delta time. Delta time is the difference between the lap times of two cars or the time difference between a lap time and a reference time. This information is crucial for teams and drivers to understand their performance and make necessary adjustments during the race. Delta time has been an essential part of Formula 1 since its early days and has a rich history. Through the years, the methods and technology used to calculate delta time have evolved, allowing for more precise measurements and a better understanding of how different factors contribute to a car\u2019s performance on the track. It is used not only during actual races but also in practice and qualifying sessions to help teams strategize and optimize their performance. Key Takeaways Delta time is the difference in lap times between two cars or between a lap time and a reference time in Formula 1 racing. It has been an integral part of the sport since its inception and plays a crucial role in measuring performance and informing adjustments. The concept of delta time is utilized across all aspects of Formula 1, including races, practice sessions, and qualifying rounds. Origin and History of Delta Time in Formula 1 Delta time is a valuable concept in Formula 1, providing insights into the performance differences between drivers and cars during races. The idea behind delta time is straightforward: it is the gap in time between two drivers\u2019 lap times, which allows teams and spectators to observe and compare their performance accurately. Formula 1 has always been a sport centered around speed and precision since its inception in the early 1950s. As the premier class of single-seater auto racing, every aspect of the sport, including innovations like delta time, contributes to its continued growth and progress. Early uses of delta time were likely manual calculations\n3. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: Formula 1 looking for new name for Las Vegas paddock building because of 2017 mass shooting\nbody: The Las Vegas Grand Prix is looking to change the name of the paddock building being built for November\u2019s race because of the 2017 mass shooting in the city. A 300,000-square-foot building is under construction for the Nov. 18 race and will hold the garages for the 20 cars competing in the event. The building has been commonly referred to as \u201cthe paddock building\u201d as the word paddock is a common term in racing and is used to refer to the area where team garages are housed. However, the building may have a different name in the near future. A spokesperson for Formula 1 told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the Grand Prix is looking to rename the building because of the name of Stephen Paddock, the man who killed 60 people and wounded hundreds when he opened fire from his hotel room on people attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1, 2017. From the Review-Journal: [Formula 1 representative Stephanie Allen] said paddock is a word used globally to describe the building that houses drivers\u2019 garages, but told Clark County Commissioners that officials were looking at changing the name out of sensitivity to the community.\u201d The 2017 shooting is the deadliest mass shooting in United States history. Paddock was found dead in his hotel room after opening fire on the crowd from his 32nd-floor hotel room and a definitive motive for the shooting is still unknown. \u201cWe were unable to determine a motive for the shooter,\u201d the FBI said in a March statement. \u201cSpeculating on a motive causes more harm to the hundreds of people who were victims that night.\u201d The November race on the Las Vegas Strip and surrounding streets\n4. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: PSGL F1 23 \u2013 PC: Season 34 Round 12 Jeddah.

PSGL (Premier Sim Gaming Leagues) is back with round 12 in Jeddah which has an average speed of 252 KM/h making it the second fastest speed track on the calendar after Monza. As a street circuit track, it ranks number one out of the current 5 that are on the calendar. This track has three DRS zones. Each leads into heavy braking zone corners which is great for overtaking. This track is a very high-speed track and drivers will spend more than a third of the lap at full throttle. With 27 corners (A lot are high-speed) the tyres will suffer over the length of a race so tyre strategies can be important. Sectors 1 and 2 are filled with fast zig-zag-like corners which can easily overheat the tyres if they arent taken correctly. Sector 3 has the least amount of corners (6) and will be an important area to cool tyres down for the next lap. Jeddah Track Map When is PSGL PC 1 PSGL PC 1 will be hosted every Wednesday at 7 pm BST // 8 pm CEST // 2 pm EDT // 1 pm CDT // 11 am PDT. PSGL Qualifying Format Each round will feature three qualifying shootouts and a race. This works similarly to Formula 1 but all four events are set on the same day within two and a half hours.

The 24-year-old is accused of killing two YNW associates, SakChaser and Juvy, back in 2018. His defense claims that the young men were killed as a result of a drive-by shooting, however, prosecutors believe he shot them from within the vehicle. If he\u2019s convicted, he could be facing the death penalty. In July, jurors were unable to come to a unanimous decision as to whether or not he\u2019s guilty, leading the judge to rule a mistrial . Now, one of the jurors from the first trial has come forward, making some serious claims about the case. The anonymous juror has alleged that Melly was framed for double murder. \u201cI believe that he didn\u2019t do it and it wasn\u2019t proved in court,\u201d they explained. \u201c This was a really bad situation of being framed. \u201d The former juror further claims that \u201cMelly was a very good person,\u201d adding that he \u201calways tried to help out people around him.\u201d Read More: YNW Melly Trial: Motion Filed Against Lead Detective Amid Excessive Force Investigation Juror Says \u201cMelly Was A Very Good Person\u201d At the beginning of last month, a former juror also said that jury manipulation is what led to the mistrial. They accused one woman on the jury of being \u201cexplosive and \u201cmanipulative,\u201d further claiming that she\u2019d go off on other jurors who didn\u2019t share her same opinion. According to the juror, she was set on acquitting Melly. In August, the lead detective on Melly\u2019s case, Detective M. Moretti, also had a motion filed against him for allegedly using \u201cexcessive force\u201d on a witness. Melly\u2019s retrial is scheduled to begin in October. The rapper now only needs an 8-4 vote in order to give him the death penalty under Florida state law. In October, YNW Bortlen will also begin his own trial.

Juror number 7 says she believes the rapper was 'framed' for the murder of his two friends in 2018 and shared she was able to convince two other jurors to vote against convicting him, leading to a 9-3 deadlock. \"I believe that he didn't do it and it wasn't proved in court,\" said the anonymous juror to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in her first interview after jury deliberations ended. \"This was really bad situation of being framed. Melly was a very good person. He always tried to help people out around him.\" In October 2018, YNW Melly, born Jamell Demons, was accused of fatally shooting friends Christopher \"YNW Juvy\" Thomas and Anthony \"YNW Sakchaser\" Williams inside a car that was being driven by another friend Cortland \"YNW Bortlen\" Henry. Prosecutors claim that Demons and Henry then drove to an area near the Everglades to stage the murders as a drive-by shooting by firing at the back and passenger sides of Henry's Jeep from the outside. \"Between them leaving the recording studio and the phone pinging in the Everglades, anything could have happened,\" added the juror. Despite prosecutors saying that ballistic tests show the deceased were shot from inside the Jeep but defense lawyers are focused on the absence of the murder weapon that was never recovered. The holdout juror believes that racial profiling may have played a role in the investigation as the Demons, Henry, and the victims are Black but the lead police investigator and lead prosecutor are white. \"This was not a matter of fact but a matter of race,\" said the juror, who is Black. \"I wasn't there, but I believe he was being framed, based on the text messages,\" added the juror in reference to text messages that reportedly show Demons disputing with the victims over creative credit and compensation as a possible motive for their murder.

The rapper's lawyers filed a Brady motion Wednesday requesting the prosecution to turn over exculpatory evidence. \"(The defense team) has recently learned that the lead detective, Detective M. Moretti, is under investigation and that an Assistant State Attorney has given a statement concerning an incident involving excessive force used by him against a potential witness in this case,\" the rapper's lawyer wrote in the filing. Details on the incident and investigation were not immediately available. Miramar Police told NBC6 they received the complaint and were looking into it. YNW Melly, whose real name is Jamell Demons, is in jail awaiting a re-trial in his double murder case. His initial trial ended in a mistrial back in July. Demons is accused of shooting and killing two childhood friends, Christopher Thomas Jr. and Anthony Williams, in October of 2018. They were all part of the YNW rapper collective. Demons, Williams and Thomas were riding in a Jeep driven by Cortland Henry, known as YNW Bortlen, after a recording session in Fort Lauderdale when Demons fatally shot Williams and Thomas, prosecutors said. Authorities said Demons and Henry staged the crime scene to resemble a drive-by shooting. Demons has pleaded not guilty and faces a possible death sentence if convicted.\n4. publish date: 2023-08-24, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Miramar Police look into complaint against lead detective in YNW Melly murder case\nbody: Miramar Police confirmed Thursday that they are reviewing a complaint filed by the mother of YNW Melly against the lead detective in the rapper\u2019s double murder case . \u201cWe received a complaint by an attorney representing Jamie King,\u201d said Miramar Police Department spokeswoman Tania Rues. \u201cOur office is looking into the complaint, as we look into all complaints.\u201d The detective, Mark Moretti, has been with the department for more than 20 years, Rues said. \u201cThere have been no administrative investigations against him in all that time,\u201d Rues said. King is the mother of Jamell Demons, the given name of YNW Melly. Demons\u2019 lawyers filed a motion in his case seeking \u201cBrady\u201d material against the detective. Brady material refers to information that could be used to question the integrity of law enforcement officers who testify in criminal cases. Details about the encounter between Demons\u2019 mother and Moretti were not available Thursday with one exception \u2014 while the incident took place on Oct. 12, 2022, the complaint was not filed until this month, Rues said. Demons is charged with the 2018 murders of two of his closest friends , Christopher \u201cYNW Juvy\u201d Thomas and Anthony \u201cYNW Sakchaser\u201d Williams. His first trial ended last month in a hung jury, and his retrial is scheduled to start in October. Demons faces the death penalty if convicted. A co-defendant, Cortland \u201cYNW Bortlen\u201d Henry, is accused of driving Demons and the victims to a remote Miramar location where the shootings took place. Henry is also accused of helping Demons stage the scene to make it look like his car had been targeted in a drive-by shooting. Efforts to reach Demons\u2019 lawyers to find out why so much time passed between the incident involving Moretti and King and the filing of the complaint were unsuccessful late Wednesday.

Along Italy\u2019s northern Adriatic coast and in Tuscan fish farms workers were pulling up their nets and finding them chewed to threads. Then they began discovering eels with missing heads and harvested clams and mussels with their meat already devoured. The culprit, which now threatens millions of euros worth of annual profits in shellfish, is the Atlantic blue crab, first introduced in the bilge water of foreign merchant and cruise ships several years ago. In just a few years, the foreign critters, which can produce two million eggs a year and hold no natural predators in Italy, have reproduced quickly, wiping out the entire clam and mussel harvest for some fishermen. Agricultural industry group FedagriPesca estimates that more than half the nation\u2019s clams and mussels were eaten by the blue crab this summer. Culinary solution Initially, the government recommended catching and destroying the crabs, which are delicacies in other parts of the world. And it didn\u2019t take long for some fishermen, their nets laden with the tiny beasts, to monetize the mayhem. Now Italians are turning the killer crustaceans into a culinary delicacy, introducing them into risotto, pasta dishes and even salads. Italian farmers\u2019 group Coldiretti suggests serving the blue crab with rosemary in a salad, or with sauteed garlic over spaghetti. \u201cThese are some of the dishes recommended by chefs, fishermen and farmers of [Coldiretti] to fight the invasion of the sea killer, which is devastating the national coasts with damage into the millions of euros,\u201d the group said in a statement in support of harvesting and selling the invasive crabs. \u201cThe goal is to help contain the excessive diffusion of the crab, which is taking over the seabed of our coasts, identifying economic opportunities for the hard-hit territories.\u201d Marine biologists say warmer seawater and above average temperatures mean that the crabs are thriving \u2013 and taking over. They\u2019ve already been found all along Italy\u2019s vast coastline and even in the Po Delta, a UNESCO heritage site known for its vongole veraci clam variety, which has been largely obliterated this summer. \u201cUsually when the water temperatures drop below 10 C (50 F), this variety of crab doesn\u2019t survive,\u201d Enridca Franchi, a marine biologist and researcher with the University of Siena, says. \u201cBut now the crab finds the ideal temperature 12 months of the year.\u201d \u2018Natural disaster\u2019 The Italian government has allocated \u20ac2.9 million to help sustain the fishermen and fight the invasion in the country, which is Europe\u2019s largest producer of clams.

Where we spend hundreds of dollars on our time-honored crab feasts, the Italian fishing community sees these crabs as the enemy. They are eating up young clams and mussels, key fisheries for the country\u2019s seafood industry. As Bay Bulletin first reported in 2019, scientists believe blue crabs made their way to the Mediterranean in the ballast water of ships, scooped up in North America and released into the water overseas. The crabs were first detected in the Ebro Delta in Spain in 2012. They\u2019ve since been spreading via sea, rivers and wetlands, multiplying even as scientists attempted to study their migration patterns. In Spain, the crabs\u2019 claws were damaging fishing nets. But for Italy, there\u2019s a lot more at stake than damaged fishing nets. The fishermens\u2019 association Fedagripesca-Confcooperative reports that the crabs have already eaten up nearly 90 percent of young clams and cost Italy about \u20ac100m ($107.2 million U.S.). Italy is Europe\u2019s largest clam producer and the third largest in the world (after China and South Korea). In the meantime, government leaders are advising fishermen to catch as many blue crabs as possible to try to curb the population. But it may not be enough. Fedagripesca-Confcooperative says 326 tons of blue crabs have been caught in Veneto so far this year. One Italian man with ties to Maryland\u2014and a strong love of crab feasts\u2014wants to get his family and friends on board with picking blue crabs. Cesare Barban, 34, is an IT manager in the northeast Italy province of Treviso, about an hour from Venice and the Adriatic shore that is currently plagued by crabs. When he was in college, Barban tells us, he had an American girlfriend who was from Maryland. He spent a few months living with her family in the Westminster area, experiencing \u201cthe real Maryland lifestyle\u201d, as he puts it. \u201cDays filled with crab-based cuisine, boat sailing in the Chesapeake Bay, baseball games, countryside horse riding, picking the Halloween pumpkins right off the pumpkin patch, Baltimore Aquarium, food, food, food\u2026it was all a blast!\u201d Barban also fell in love with Old Bay and J.O. Spice seasoning, keeping it in his Italian kitchen. He says he\u2019s been going around to Venetian fish markets asking for blue crabs for a couple of years, but until recently, the fishmongers had never heard of any such crab. Until now. This year, its population is booming in the Adriatic Sea and\n3. publish date: 2023-08-30, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Blue crabs invade Italy, decimating clam, mussel and oyster populations\nbody: NORFOLK, Va. \u2014 Delicious, succulent and valuable. Here in Hampton Roads, blue crabs are the most iconic species in the Chesapeake Bay, propelling commercial fishing into a $30 million industry every year. If you travel north to Maryland, they\u2019re more than just a food resource - but a sense of state pride and tradition. That is why it\u2019s hard to grasp that, 4,000 miles away in Europe, the blue crab is becoming public enemy number one. In the waters off the coast of Italy, clams reign supreme, and an unexpected surge in our beloved blue crab is decimating the population of Italians\u2019 favorite seafood. Fishermen, lobbying groups and environmentalists have sounded the alarm about the risks from a summer surge in the population of the fast-reproducing invasive species. The crabs are devouring stocks of eels, clams and mussels and wreaking havoc on fishing nets. According to the Associated Press, 50% of clams, mussels, and oysters have been damaged by the blue crab, which reproduces fast and has no natural predators. Italy is the largest producer of clams in Europe and the third largest in the world after China and South Korea, according to U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization data from 2021. Once considered rare in Europe, environmentalists with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation believe warmer waters due to climate change may have brought on the increase in population. The problem has become so bad that the Italian government has allocated 2.9 million euros, about $3 million, to fight the invasion. Some fishing associations and restaurants overseas are embracing this new way of life, though, hoping to introduce Italians and their palates to the beloved American staple. Ironically, here at home, the blue crab population has struggled over the last decade. However, the number of blue crabs living in the Chesapeake Bay is showing improvement after reaching record lows in 2022, a survey conducted jointly by Virginia and Maryland found. The 2023 Blue Crab Winter Dredge Survey put the estimated total crab abundance at 323 million, compared to the 227 million estimated in 2022, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) said.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

There are plenty of storylines to follow since the Denver Nuggets beat the Miami Heat for the NBA title in June. Players seeking trades before the season kicks off? Hello, James Harden and Damian Lillard . MVPs entering the final year of their deals? That'll be Giannis Antetokounmpo . Legends wanting perhaps one last title shot?

We know about the Golden State Warriors , Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics -- not to mention sleeper picks like the Minnesota Timberwolves . But what teams just need to put together a solid season? (Looking at you, Dallas Mavericks .) There are a lot of questions surrounding the landscape of the 2023-24 season, and our experts broke down the biggest ones ahead of the preseason. Let's dive in. 1. The Nuggets are heavy favorites to repeat (according to us) . Which team is in the best position to knock them out in a best-of-seven? Jamal Collier: I'm going with the Suns, who had a strong offseason to give Kevin Durant and Devin Booker some help after they were not able to carry the team past the Nuggets by themselves last playoffs. The acquisition of Bradley Beal and some smart additions to fill out the roster this offseason -- Keita Bates-Diop , Yuta Watanabe and Jordan Goodwin -- gives Phoenix a reputable bench to surround their stars. Beal should thrive in his new role, and being a third option will make a lot of people remember how talented of a scorer he is. Phoenix looks like Denver's best challenger in the West.

The newly re-signed swingman out of the University of Oklahoma is a reserve on Team USA, but has been a big contributor thus far. New York Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson and Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star shooting guard Anthony Edwards comprise the program's starting backcourt. The Americans beat Team Italy in a 100-63 blowout during the quarterfinals, and now will get a three-day reprieve before their semifinal matchup. That victory, by the way, means that Team USA has now bested its most recent finish at the last World Cup (a paltry seventh place).

For the uninitiated, regional-exclusive Pok\u00e9mon are those special \u2018mons that you can only catch in specific geographical locations. Think of them as the Pok\u00e9mon world\u2019s rarest travel souvenirs. Whether it\u2019s Tauros in the USA, Mr. Mime gallivanting across Europe, or Corsola basking in the tropics, each generation brings its own set of region-locked critters. It\u2019s not just about countries or continents; regional exclusivity also extends to specific geographical features. Take the Vivillon patterns, for instance, which change based on the region\u2019s postcards. Then there\u2019s the celestial duo of Lunatone and Solrock, who prefer specific hemispheres.

The ETI is a reliable employment index. If it increases, we can expect more jobs, but a decrease suggests fewer jobs. The index has been falling since March 2022, hinting at possible changes in job numbers. Selcuk Eren, a Senior Economist at The Conference Board, stated that despite the fall, the Index is still high. This suggests that job growth may continue, but at a slower pace. Eren noted that some sectors, such as information services and transportation, are already losing jobs. The August ETI suggests that job losses could spread to other sectors. For example, there's been a consistent drop in temporary help services employment, a sign of hiring trends. Job openings are also decreasing, although they're still higher than before the pandemic. Consumer sentiment reflects a slowing job market, with more consumers finding jobs hard to get. Despite this, wages are still higher than before the pandemic. This could lead to inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, possibly causing job losses and higher unemployment in 2024. The ETI's August drop was due to negative contributions from six of its eight components. These include the Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find 'Jobs Hard to Get', the Ratio of Involuntarily Part-time to All Part-time Workers, the Percentage of Firms with Positions Not Able to Fill, the Number of Employees Hired by Temporary-Help Industry, Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance, and Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales.

Perhaps I should say politician, although he is a better and smoother liar than most politicians because he can draw on the reserve of credibility that comes from wearing a white coat and claiming the mantle of science. As Jazz wrote yesterday, Fauci is back on the COVIDmania tour, pushing his debunked narrative that the policies he pushed during the height of the pandemic will really work this time, even though they proved completely worthless in stopping the spread of COVID and absolutely disastrous to the economic and social health of the country. He made the mistake of showing up on the normally friendly CNN to promote hysteria and in particular mask mandates yet again, and this time he got some serious pushback from Michael Smerconish. It\u2019s about time. At issue was the Cochrane Review meta-analysis of mask studies, which conclusively demonstrated that population-level mask mandates don\u2019t work to slow or stop the spread of COVID (or the flu). This is as true for N95 masks as with the absurd surgical masks, or the even more absurd cloth masks that the CDC and Fauci pretended could do anything but make things even worse.

Cases are undeniably on the rise right now, and Montana Governor Greg Gianforte did not keep quiet on the hot topic. \"We ended our state of emergency from the pandemic over two years ago,\" Gianforte said in his post to X, the site formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday. \"We will not bring lockdowns and mask mandates to Montana.\" Biden has thus far not tested positive since his wife's case began, and the First Lady has only had mild symptoms as of now. President Biden attended a ceremony honoring an 81-year-old Vietnam veteran Tuesday, and, after he had shown up wearing a mask, he took his mask off during the event, shaking hands with the unmasked soldier. Both the national emergency and mask mandates have ended, but the virus is still out there.

The former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 82, was branded as the nation's Covid czar because he sternly recommended wearing face coverings and social distancing in public. As early as April 2020 , he told fearful Americans: 'If everybody does that, we\u2019re each protecting each other. Because the data is, it's more efficient to prevent transmitting to others than it is to prevent transmission to yourself.' People had to wear masks in schools, public transportation, restaurants, and workplaces. But following a series of leaked emails and interviews since the height of the pandemic, Fauci has been criticized for flip-flopping in his beliefs as he admitted there is a lack of evidence to suggest they worked in halting the spread of the virus. He recently told CNN : 'When you're talking about the effect on the epidemic or the pandemic as a whole, the data are less strong. 'But there are other studies, that show at an individual level, for individuals, they might be protective.'

Though well established after five years in the Garden State, the insect has been less conspicuous in 2023, said George Hamilton, a professor and entomologist at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick. The spotted lanternfly may be running out of steam or simply experiencing an off year. Populations in 2023 have been lower than in each of the last two years, Hamilton said. \"Possible reasons could be the hot dry weather we had last summer, the severe cold we had in January or the relatively warm weather we had during most of the winter,\" he said. \"It could also be that the high populations have severely damaged or killed their host plants, causing them to move on.\" Where did the spotted lanternfly come from? Harmless to people and pets, yet destructive to plants, the spotted lanternfly made its way into the United States from Asia via Pennsylvania, where established colonies were first reported in 2014. In 2018, the species made a home in New Jersey. Since, it has since spread statewide. This past winter, New Jersey Department of Agriculture officials added the last eight of the state's 21 counties into their spotted lantern quarantine zone. Accompanying regulations require residents to check outdoor items, such as building materials, firewood and camping gear, for live insects or egg masses prior to moving them outside the quarantine area. The quarantine coupled with its educational campaign and herbicide treatments on the tree of heaven have shown promise in combating the spotted lanternfly, said Anne Nielsen, also an entomologist at Rutgers. Still, to manage the species over the long term, Nielsen said a multi-stage approach is required. That could mean future biological control with species that target lanternflies, she said. Natural predators, such as spiders, birds and the praying mantis, have proven formidable. Though poor-flying, the spotted lanternfly has already spread to much of the Northeast and established colonies as far west as Indiana, according\n2. publish date: 2023-06-06, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Delaware scientists find potential solution to invasive spotted lanternflies\nbody: NEWARK, Del. (CBS) -- Summer is almost here, which means it won't be long before swarms of spotted lanternflies come to the Philadelphia area . It's been almost 10 years since the invasive species first appeared in the region, but are scientists making any progress in getting them under control? Part of the problem is that because lanternflies are an invasive species from Asia, they don't have any natural predators in America, which has allowed their population to explode. Researchers in Delaware say they traveled to China and came back with a couple of natural predators with major potential. \"The species name is Dryinus sinicus,\" Kim Hoelmer, with Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit, said, \"and it has no common name.\" Inside a USDA laboratory on the University of Delaware's campus, researchers have been studying spotted lanternflies ever since they arrived in Berks County, Pennsylvania , nearly 10 years ago. \"These females search through the environment,\" Hoelmer said, \"and they attack the young nymphal stages.\" Their goal is to find a natural predator capable of controlling the invasive species before the spotted lanternflies do more damage to American agriculture , especially grape growers. \"When [spotted lanternfly adults] become very abundant and buzz around in the fall, they become bothersome to people,\" Hoelmer said. \"But the real impact of this invasive species, the economic impact, is because of its ability to attack grapes.\" The recently retired Hoelmer is still part of the project. Through extensive research, Hoelmer and his colleagues have honed in on two tiny parasitic wasps that specifically seek out and attack adolescent lanternflies in their native country of China. \"The first of these of these wasps is a small parasitic wasp that attacks lanternfly eggs,\" Hoelmer said, \"and the second is another parasitic wasp a little bit larger that attacks the younger nymphal stages after the eggs hatched.\" Smaller than the size of your fingernail. Hoelmer says you don't have to worry about these wasps stinging or hurting humans, but because they're not native to\n3. publish date: 2023-08-26, Saturday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: What happened to all the spotted lanternflies that were plaguing NJ?\nbody: Reports from parts of NJ suggest there are fewer spotted lanternflies out and about Some areas of the state are reporting high populations Experts don't expect to completely eradicate the pest, just control it A relatively new nuisance for the Garden State appears to be less visible in 2023, but it'd be too soon to declare victory over the spotted lanternfly. In fact, the Asia-native insect is here to stay. Experts' ultimate goal is to just get the invasive species down to levels that aren't bothersome to people or detrimental to crops and trees. New Jersey doesn't officially track the presence of the spotted lanternfly on a yearly basis, but, due to reports from experts and residents, officials believe that areas of the state that had huge populations in the past are seeing very low numbers in 2023. \"They're still there, but you're just not seeing as many of them,\" said Saul Vaiciunas, plant pathologist with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture. Can we declare victory over the spotted lanternfly? Vaiciunas said the fluctuation may have to do with the supply of the bug's favorite food source: the tree of heaven. If it's depleted, the winged planthoppers may be searching for the tree elsewhere. \"It's good news if you're not seeing too many (spotted lanternflies). But don't feel too comfortable; they could come back,\" Vaiciunas said. Vaiciunas said the Department is hearing reports of high populations in Bergen County, as well as eastern Monmouth and Ocean counties. The state applies treatment at \"priority locations\" such as seaports, airports, and train yards, Vaiciunas said. \"As of right now, it's not fully understood why the populations are fluctuating the way they are,\" Vaiciunas said. History of the spotted lanternfly in New Jersey The first U.S. spotted lanternfly sighting was recorded in 2014, in Pennsylvania.

All information was researched and verified by an actual human. This invasive species is beautiful yet highly destructive New Jersey's tranquil landscapes are under siege from an unwelcome visitor: the invasive spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula). Originating from Southeast Asia, this pest has rapidly spread across the United States, wreaking havoc on agricultural crops and native ecosystems. In this article, we will delve into the potential consequences of the spotted lanternfly invasion in New Jersey and explore the measures being taken to combat its relentless march. The Arrival of an Unwanted Guest: First observed in Pennsylvania in 2014, the spotted lanternfly made its presence known in New Jersey just a few years later. Its distinctive appearances, featuring bright red wings with black spots and a vibrant yellow abdomen, make it easily identifiable. Unfortunately, these beautiful markings disguise the damage it inflicts on the environment. A Threat to Agriculture: The spotted lanternfly poses a significant threat to New Jersey's thriving agricultural industry. Plants like grapes, hops, and apples, are damaged by this invasive pest that feeds on sap, weakening the host plant and making it susceptible to disease and decline. Vineyards, orchards, and other fruit-bearing crops have experienced devastating losses as the spotted lanternfly population continues to multiply. Ecosystem Disruption: Beyond agriculture, the spotted lanternfly has the potential to disrupt ecosystems across New Jersey. By outcompeting native insects and insects, it can upset the delicate balance of predator-prey relationships. Furthermore, the pest secretes large amounts of sticky \"honeydew,\" which attracts other insects, promotes the growth of mold, and creates a nuisance for residents. Prevention and Control: Given the severity of the issue, various organizations and government agencies are working tirelessly to mitigate the spread of the spotted lanternfly in New Jersey.

After winning last time out in the Netherlands during his home race, the Dutchman knew that another victory would make it 10 in succession, a feat never achieved before in the sport. At first, it looked like it might not happen given Carlos Sainz's staunch defence from pole position for Ferrari following a delayed start to the race after Yuki Tsunoda's car didn't even make it to the grid thanks to an engine problem. The Spanish driver kept his former teammate at bay for 15 laps before a small mistake left the door open for Verstappen to pounce down the straight into corner three. After that overtake, the world champion never looked back as he finished the race 16 seconds ahead of his closest competitor, teammate Sergio Perez, who put together a solid performance from P5 on the grid. Sainz himself finished the race in the final podium spot after teammate Charles Leclerc looked to make a pass towards the end but failed to make any chance count to instead finish P4.

The two-time defending Formula 1 champion easily set a new F1 record with his 10th race win in a row on Sunday in the Italian Grand Prix. Verstappen had to chase the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz through the opening laps, but once he got past Sainz as the Ferrari\u2019s tires wore out quicker than Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull, it was smooth sailing the rest of the way. The win breaks Verstappen\u2019s tie with former Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel for the most consecutive wins. Vettel won nine consecutive races to end the 2013 season as he won his fourth and final title. The victory also extends a record for Red Bull. The win is the 15th consecutive for the team dating back to the final race of 2022. Sergio Perez, who finished second to Verstappen on Sunday, won the second and fourth races of the 2023 season. Verstappen won the 2022 season finale in Abu Dhabi in November, the 2023 season opener in Bahrain and also in Melbourne before starting his 10-race win streak. Verstappen is now 145 points ahead of Perez in the driver\u2019s standings with eight races to go in the season. If Verstappen keeps winning, he will clinch the 2023 title with a handful of races to go. With 25 points available to race winners, Verstappen looks most likely to clinch at the Qatar Grand Prix on Oct. 8. Ferrari finishes ahead of Mercedes Sainz and teammate Charles Leclerc had stellar qualifying pace and sandwiched Verstappen on the grid. Sainz had a good getaway from the pole position and kept Verstappen at bay for as long as he could. But once Verstappen got past, the race was effectively over and Sainz and Leclerc had to worry about staying ahead of Perez. Sainz came home in third ahead of Leclerc in fourth in what\u2019s Ferrari\u2019s home race at Monza. It was still an excellent result for Ferrari as they were able to be ahead of both Mercedes drivers in fifth and sixth. George Russell finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton while Alex Albon was a strong seventh in his Williams ahead of Lando Norris and Fernando Alonso. When could someone else win? The Sept. 24 race in Singapore could be an opportunity for a driver in a non-Red Bull car to win. But at this point, it\u2019s not worth counting on it. A Red Bull season sweep gets more feasible with every passing race, though the odds are still stacked against it. No F1 team has ever swept an entire season\u2019s worth of races and Ferrari and Mercedes have shown enough flashes of pace to make an upset feel feasible at some point this season.

No Formula One driver has ever won as many races in a row in a season. The Red Bull driver had matched the previous all-time record of nine, set by Sebastian Vettel 10 years ago, at last weekend\u2019s Dutch Grand Prix. Victory at Monza was Verstappen\u2019s 12th of the year and increases the likelihood of Red Bull becoming the first F1 team to win every race in a season. McLaren came close to doing so in 1988, winning all but one of the 16 races on the calendar, but such is Red Bull\u2019s supremacy no team looks close to being able to topple them over the course of the 23-race season. \u201cI never would\u2019ve believed that that was possible,\u201d the Dutchman said after the race on the ESPN broadcast when asked about the record. \u201cWe had to work for it today and that made it definitely a lot more fun.\u201d Verstappen started the race in second place having narrowly lost out to Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz Jr. in a dramatic qualifying session on Saturday, but overtook the Spaniard on Lap 15. As has been the case so many times this year, Verstappen\u2019s dominance was obvious as soon as he took the lead. He gradually extended his advantage over the chasing pack to finish six seconds ahead of Sergio Perez in second. The podium was rounded out by Sainz Jr. ahead of his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in fourth. Verstappen leads the drivers\u2019 championship by 145 points. His teammate Perez, who has won the season\u2019s other races, is second. The 25-year-old star, who has now won 47 races in all, which puts him fifth on the all-time list, has the chance to extend his record at the Singapore Grand Prix on September 17.

According to the Anti-Defamation League said the group was comprised of members from extremist white nationalist organizations including the Order of the Black Sun, Aryan Freedom Network and the National Socialist Movement. In the news: Pinellas Detectives Charge Palm Harbor Man With 20-Counts Of Child Porn Later on Saturday, a group of over 50 neo-Nazis demonstrated across the greater Orlando area, waving flags with swastikas, shouting hateful messages and saluting Adolf Hitler. The members reportedly chanted rallying cries including \u201cWhite power\u201d and \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, called the rally \u201cabsolutely disgusting stuff and another example of the far right extremism growing in FL.\u201d At one point, in a video posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, an interviewer asked Christopher Pohlhaus, the spokesman for the groups, about their positions. Pohlhaus was then asked about the presidential election. He then added, \u201cI think [President Joe] Biden is better than [former President Donald] Trump because he sends rockets to Ukraine.\u201d Pohlhaus continued, \u201cHail Ukraine! Hail Azov,\u201d which referred to the Azov battalion, a group of anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists who are neo-Nazi sympathizers. In the news: New Jersey Man Charged In $13 Million Tech Support Scam Targeting Over 7K U.S. Victims At another point in the rally, the group told Laura Loomer, a former Republican congressional candidate who is Jewish, that she should be thrown into an oven.

About 15 people wearing clothing and bearing flags emblazoned with Nazi insignia demonstrated outside the entrance to the Disney Springs shopping center, said the Orange County Sheriff's Office, which said deputies were dispatched around 10:40 a.m. According to the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights organization dedicated to countering extremism, participants carried antisemitic, white supremacist and anti-LGBTQ flags and signs. The group consisted of members of the neo-Nazi groups Order of the Black Sun, Aryan Freedom Network and 14 First, a now disbanded group that has been absorbed into the National Socialist Movement, the largest neo-Nazi group in the U.S., according to the ADL. The extremists dispersed after about two hours, and no one was arrested, the sheriff's office said. Representatives for Walt Disney World did not respond to requests for comment Sunday afternoon. The theme park has been embroiled in controversies this year: Its governing district drew criticism for abolishing its diversity, equity and inclusion programs last month, and the theme park is mounting a legal challenge against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and has encountered backlash from some Disney devotees for closing its famous Splash Mountain ride in January because of its incorporation of characters from the 1946 film \u201cSong of the South,\u201d which featured racist stereotypes. In a statement, the sheriff's office said that the extremist groups were looking for attention and that it condemned their actions. \"We know these groups demonstrate in high profile areas in order to agitate and incite people with antisemitic symbols and slurs,\" the sheriff's office said. \"The Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office deplores hate speech in any form, but people have the First Amendment right to demonstrate.

The Walt Disney Company mostly returned that support. Though they initially warned other guests about \u201chomosexuals\u201d gathering at Walt Disney World Resort, the House of Mouse provided insurance for Disney Cast Members\u2019 civil partners before same-sex marriage was legalized long before other corporations. Despite conservative protest, Walt Disney Studios added LGBTQIA+ representation to films starting in the mid-2010s. Former Disney CEO Bob Chapek reaffirmed the company\u2019s support for the community in 2022. Directly defying a warning from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the executive publicly disavowed the Parental Rights in Education Act, popularly known as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law. Though it resulted in numerous legal battles between DeSantis and Walt Disney World Resort, Disney stood by its stance. They released their first \u201cofficial\u201d Disney Pride merchandise collection later that year, donating proceeds to LGBTQIA+ charities. Disney Cast Members marched in more than a dozen Pride parades worldwide. Pride Month murals became permanent installations at Walt Disney World Resort. Current Disney CEO Bob Iger publicly reaffirmed the company\u2019s pro-LGBTQIA+ stance numerous times and backed a lawsuit against DeSantis. But some LGBTQIA+ guests are hesitant to visit Walt Disney World Resort, especially after Saturday\u2019s Neo-Nazi protests. \u201cI booked a trip to Disney World almost a year ago and now the timing is quickly arriving, I\u2019m concerned about the current political climate in Florida with regards to LGBTQ+ families,\u201d Reddit user u/Randomvicgirl wrote. \u201cWe are huge Disney fans and we were exciting to experience our little ones first trip but we\u2019re feeling nervous now especially since Canada issued a travel advisory this past week for LGBTQ+ travellers to certain states.\u201d Disney Parks fans were empathetic to the family\u2019s concerns. \u201cLiteral Nazis are right at the front gates of the resort at the moment,\u201d said u/BroadwayCatDad. \u201cAll these comments talking about how safe it is but interesting how literally no one is mentioning the ACTUAL REAL LIFE NAZIS protesting at the gates,\u201d u/FairoyFae agreed. \u201cLiteral f**king Nazis.

The remarks came a day after bloody protests by rival groups of Eritreans in south Tel Aviv left dozens of people injured. Eritreans, supporters and opponents of Eritrea\u2019s government, faced off with construction lumber, pieces of metal and rocks, smashing shop windows and police cars. Israeli police in riot gear shot tear gas, stun grenades and live rounds while officers on horseback tried to control the protesters. The violence on Saturday returned to the fore the issue of migrants, which has long divided Israel. Its resurgence comes as Israel is torn over Netanyahu\u2019s judicial overhaul plan, and supporters cite the migrant issue as a reason why the courts should be reined in, saying they have stood in the way of pushing the migrants out. \u201cWe want harsh measures against the rioters, including the immediate deportation of those who took part,\u201d Netanyahu said in a special ministerial\n5. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Eritreans in Tel Aviv unsure if they fear Netanyahu or other Eritreans more\nbody: Tel Aviv, Israel \u2013 Halefom Sultan, an Eritrean refugee in Israel living in the diverse central Tel Aviv neighbourhood of Neve Sha\u2019anan, says he is afraid to venture out of his house at night out of fear of violent retribution from pro-regime Eritreans.

Israel is on the migrant route from Africa to Europe. Many of the migrants who make it to Israel don\u2019t actually leave. Parts of Tel Aviv have been taken over by migrants and gangs who have their own no-go zones. Why don\u2019t you know about it? Because nobody wants to talk about it. The media generally isn\u2019t interested in covering it except when it occasionally reports on pro-migrant leftist protests, and the pro-Israel camp tends to repeat the stuff that the establishment puts out, which is ignoring the problem. The people suffering from the massive illegal alien migrant population are the ones living in poorer parts of Tel Aviv. The situation has been bad for a long time. Israel\u2019s new conservative government in part came into office on a promise to finally start deporting the illegals. Unfortunately Israel\u2019s leftist judiciary, especially its Supreme Court, has blocked such efforts. House Democrats also pressured Israel to drop any plan to deport the migrant population. And this was a government plan to hand the migrants $3,500 and buy them plane tickets.

(WWLP) \u2013 A recent genetic study of Lyme disease offers greater insight into some of the long-lasting symptoms seen in people. UV Index: Staying protected this Labor Day weekend Nearly half a million people are infected with the Lyme bacteria each year, according to the CDC. Samples from hundreds of patients revealed that certain strains of the Lyme bacteria have a protective outer layer that contains a type of protein that appears to function as armor against the human immune system. This in turn gives the bacteria a better chance of spreading throughout the body. The researchers hoped to learn how certain strains of the Lyme bacteria were able to spread beyond the initial bite site. This new research allows us to better understand why certain long-standing symptoms like body aches and pains arthritis and even memory complaints persist. It also allows scientists to create new treatment options for those dealing with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.

To reduce mosquito activity and the risk of West Nile virus, trucks will spray pesticides in sections of Brooklyn beginning on Thursday, August 31, 2023 between the hours of 8:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. the following morning. The Health Department will be using very low concentrations of Anvil 10+10, Duet or MERUS 3.0. The risks of pesticides applied by the Health Department for mosquito control are low to both people and pets. Some people who are sensitive to spray ingredients may experience short-term eye or throat irritation, or a rash. People with respiratory conditions may also be temporarily affected. In case of bad weather, the Health Department will delay application until Tuesday, September 5, 2023. In order to stay safe during spraying, the Health Department recommends residents to stay indoors, whenever possible. Air conditioners can remain on. While unnecessary, residents may wish to close air conditioner vents, or choose the recirculate function.

Our information page, Coronavirus in New York City , began in the bewildering early weeks of the crisis. Readers quickly came to rely on it to see how the virus was moving across the five boroughs. Over time, we added other metrics, including the number of COVID patients in hospital intensive care units, and numbers of vaccine and booster shots. But the pandemic has changed, and so has the available data on it. New York state, for example, reports positive COVID tests from clinical settings only \u2014 leaving out the vast number of positive results from tests conducted at home. Meanwhile, independent efforts to track COVID from organizations like the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and The New York Times ceased earlier this year. That leaves the federal Centers for Disease Control\u2019s COVID Data Tracker . At THE CITY, we still see the need for a New York City-specific view of the pandemic , but the granular view presented in earlier versions of the tracker is no longer reliable. So we\u2019re updating the tracker once again to align it with the most accurate and useful information available.

On Aug. 27 of this year, the husband, veteran, and father of four died at 49 from pancreatic cancer, his death first announced as an update to an online fundraiser curated by friends of the family. Out of more than 200 known types of the disease that causes cells to grow uncontrollably, pancreatic cancer is one of the most dangerous because it\u2019s difficult to identify in its early stages, when treatment would be most effective. (These will be the deadliest cancers in 2023.) According to a data analysis from the National Program for Cancer Registries database, the rate of early-onset pancreatic cancer \u2013 that which affects those younger than 55 \u2013 is increasing. There\u2019s better news about cancer in general, however: Fewer Americans are dying from it, thanks to factors including advances in treatment, an increase in early detection, and a drop in tobacco use. About 1.95 million Americans across the 50 states are expected to be diagnosed with cancer by the end of this year, and their chances of survival are much higher than they used to be. In the mid-\u201970s the average cancer survival rate beyond five years from diagnosis was 49% \u2013 essentially a coin flip. As of 2018, that rate had risen to 68%. In 1990, 216 out of 100,000 Americans died from cancer. By 2020, the rate was 144.1 \u2013 a 33% decline. The most common forms of the disease are prostate and female breast cancer, which make up between 14% and 22% of all cancer cases nationwide. Prostate cancer, along with thyroid and testis cancers and melanoma, have the highest five-year survival rates \u2013 between 94% and 98%. (The cancer that killed Wurzelbacher? The rate is just 12%.) To identify the states that will have the highest rate of new cancer diagnoses by the end of 2023, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the estimated number of new cancer cases this year from the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Statistics Center. Each state\u2019s population and percentage of adults who had health insurance in 2021 came from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey and are 5-year averages.

Ohio voted red in 2020 during the presidential election, and political experts believe that's not expected to change in 2024. \"I think that Trump basically tapped into a very successful vein that other Republican candidates weren't able to do and I think that he has a much bigger appeal to union voters,\" said Sabrina Eaton, D.C. bureau reporter of Cleveland.com and the Plain Dealer. But what about the states that voted for Trump in 2016 and then voted for Biden in 2020? By definition, those are the current swing states that future candidates will without a doubt, be watching closely. Looking toward the 2024 Presidential Election, political experts are referring to Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia as the key swing states, while keeping a close eye on states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, too. \"I think those states are very important because Trump lost them in 2020 and so they're only the only path forward for the Republicans no matter who the candidate is, needs to win those states back for sure,\" Youngstown State University political professor Dr. Adam Fuller said. Dr. Fuller adds that he won't count out states like North Carolina and Iowa as battleground states either, and both said depending on factors like the GOP candidate, the campaigns and the climate of the economy a year from now, there could be a flip in other states. \"The campaigns themselves will certainly make a big difference,\" Fuller said, \"So you have to combine the campaigns, with the candidates and the other factors like the client, the political climate, affected by the economy and all of those things, when it comes time.\"\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This initiative is a collaboration between Tioga County Public Health, ASAP Coalition, Mental Hygiene, and CASA-Trinity. The goal is to combat the opioid crisis by offering free Narcan kits and naloxone training. The event, first held in West Virginia in 2020, seeks to raise awareness about substance use disorder and opioid overdose. Opioids, particularly synthetic ones like fentanyl, are highly addictive. Their use has led to a rise in opioid overdoses in Tioga County, particularly in rural areas with slower emergency response times. Naloxone, also known as Narcan, is a medication that can counteract an opioid overdose if given promptly. Narcan availability in Tioga County has increased through Overdose Prevention Programs, Public Access Narcan Boxes, and pharmacies. The county urges residents to learn how to administer Narcan in case of an overdose. In line with Save A Life: Free Narcan Day, Narcan training and distribution will take place across Tioga County on September 13 and 14, 2023.

In the first half of 2023, 332 people have died due to overdoses in the first half of this year.

Overall, at least 22 bills have been introduced in state legislatures so far in 2023 to define the term \"sex\" throughout state law as strictly male or female \u2014 typically based on a person's characteristics at birth, the report said. While the impact of the laws is still uncertain, they could result in excluding transgender people from areas of public life, including sex-based nondiscrimination protections and the right to use bathrooms aligning with their gender identities. Dive Insight: In addition to the four states that enacted laws defining \"sex\" in a way that would exclude transgender people, in Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed an executive order on Aug. 1 in the same vein.. That order says any public school, public school district, and any other agency that collects data for the purpose of complying with anti-discrimination laws, like Title IX, must do so as either male or female according to biological characteristics. \"This is a new area of law that emerged this year,\" according to the Movement Advancement Project.

The decision came after a House gallery protest, ignited when Republicans didn't allow Zephyr to partake in bill debates. This incident highlighted the challenges faced by the Missoula Democrat Representative and prompted protestors in the gallery to chant 'let her speak.' This occurred during a pronouns bill discussion, which Zephyr and her backers saw as an affront to the LGBTQ+ community. Previously, Zephyr caught attention with her statement that advocates of a gender-affirming care ban could be 'accountable for potential tragic outcomes.' As a result, she was barred from the House floor by Republican lawmakers, left to oversee voting and discussions from outside the chambers. This stirred conversations about conduct in politics and triggered a surge of anti-LGBTQ+ bills across the nation. The dismissal of the charges brought relief to supporters. Zephyr was pleased with the outcome and highlighted the enduring solidarity that fought to protect democracy.

Adams says the migrant crisis could soon cost the city some $12 billion. Those are estimates over the course of three fiscal years.

F2 unveiled the new car in the Monza paddock ahead of Round 13 of the season. Things are changing for Formula 2 after a new generation of cars has been developed. The 2024 Formula 2 car will be used in next year\u2019s season as well as in 2025 and 2026. Formula 3, however, will remain with the F3 current car for 2024. The new F2 car will see some significant changes compared to the current version. But the partners of MecaChrome and Dallara are still producing the engine and chassis. The engine will continue to be a Mecachrome V6 3.4 litre turbo-charge engine. The fuel will continue to be the 55% sustainable fuels, which were introduced for the 2023 season; the hope here is that the championship will be able to use a fully-sustainable fuel by Aramco in 2027. One of the aims of the new F2 car was for it to bridge the gap to Formula 1 and be closer in terms of design. For this, both the front and rear wing as well as the nose have been designed to produce more wheel-to-wheel racing, much like F1\u2019s current design. There have also been key changes with regards to safety and also accessibility in the 2024 F2 car. An insight into the new F2 car FormulaNerds attended the official car launch press conference.

A 300,000-square-foot building is under construction for the Nov. 18 race and will hold the garages for the 20 cars competing in the event. The building has been commonly referred to as \u201cthe paddock building\u201d as the word paddock is a common term in racing and is used to refer to the area where team garages are housed. However, the building may have a different name in the near future. A spokesperson for Formula 1 told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the Grand Prix is looking to rename the building because of the name of Stephen Paddock, the man who killed 60 people and wounded hundreds when he opened fire from his hotel room on people attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1, 2017. From the Review-Journal: [Formula 1 representative Stephanie Allen] said paddock is a word used globally to describe the building that houses drivers\u2019 garages, but told Clark County Commissioners that officials were looking at changing the name out of sensitivity to the community.\u201d The 2017 shooting is the deadliest mass shooting in United States history. Paddock was found dead in his hotel room after opening fire on the crowd from his 32nd-floor hotel room and a definitive motive for the shooting is still unknown. \u201cWe were unable to determine a motive for the shooter,\u201d the FBI said in a March statement. \u201cSpeculating on a motive causes more harm to the hundreds of people who were victims that night.\u201d The November race on the Las Vegas Strip and surrounding streets is set to be the third F1 race in the city and the first in Las Vegas in over 40 years. F1 ran in 1981 and 1982 at Las Vegas. The race is also the third of three Grand Prix races in the United States in 2023.

Nowhere has that battle been more pronounced than in Florida, which made national headlines in the spring of 2022 when the state Legislature debated \u2014 and Gov.

The amount of resources, research, and re-affirming locations for the LGBTQIA+ population in the United States should automatically allow for a law similar to Brazil\u2019s hate speech law to be applied in the United States. From the Pew Research Center, Brazil legalized same-sex marriage on May 5, 2013; two years before the United States would in 2015. Regardless of the separate impact tor each country, this was monumental formal legislation for this to be set in place. I am only able to speak from one perspective, but as a 20 year old queer transman, I could never see homophobic hate speech becoming illegal in the United States. Although I have been lucky enough to not have faced direct hostility from classmates and peers, I am familiar with being called slurs or facing other harassment from strangers and drivers. LGBTQIA+ teenagers, young people, and elders are still facing the treatment they have historically received, even if there has been rapid progression in the past twenty years of American society. Trans persons in Florida should never have to seek refuge in Canada to avoid persecution. Gender-affirming care is life-saving, and I cannot say enough how taking HRT away from trans people will exponentially increase suicide rates among LGBTQIA+ youth. I do not know how to sound like a broken record now, so I will emphasize this. We are in an era where information is the most readily available in human history. If you are still purposely ignoring and dismissing information which could help you understand what it is like to grow up queer in the United States, you are harming millions of people in this country, including yourself. The United States should take action to ban homophobic hate speech and make it punishable by prison sentence, I believe Pittsburgh would benefit from this active legislation immediately. College students have academics, extracurriculars, and general life events on their plate, their safety outside of campus based on their expression or presentation of who they are cannot be another concern. As soon as people learn that hate speech is rooted in a history of violence, I would hope a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d would occur where even if they have never met a queer person, you would take the time to realize that outside your realm of possibility is another person\u2019s reality.

Congress has just 11 days when it\u2019s in session before the next federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, 2023. And in that time, it will need to enact all 12 appropriation bills to ensure that government agencies and departments have funding to keep programs going \u2013 or face a potential government shutdown. So will they pull it off? And what will happen if they don\u2019t? As an expert of public policy and former deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office, I feel that the challenge this year is the greatest faced since the enactment of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which made significant reforms in the process. This is due to the magnitude of the differences not only between the two parties but also between the House and Senate. A worse-case scenario could see a government shutdown for several weeks, or even a couple of months \u2013 and that could have a significant negative impact on the economy. The House of Representatives initially faced a workload of 12 appropriation bills to get through Congress. But just before the House broke for August recess, it passed one appropriation bill, for military construction. One down, 11 to go. The problem is the military construction bill is traditionally the easiest to pass, as it is very small: this year it stood at $19.1 billion in spending. This is substantially less than the largest bill, which is usually the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education bill. When reported, or passed, out of the committee in the Senate this year, that bill amounted to $224 billion. Providing money for military construction is also generally done without much controversy, as it includes funding for housing military families \u2013 something few members want to oppose. And while the military construction funding bill passed before the recess, the House leadership had also hoped to pass the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug bill but did not have the necessary votes for passage. Complicating matters is that ongoing funding bills could be delayed or derailed by ideological battles in Washington. The conservative Freedom Caucus in the House is pushing for tens of billions of dollars in cuts in the eight appropriation bills that fund domestic spending. The other four are military construction; defense; state and foreign operations; and the legislative branch itself. Part of this desire for cuts comes from the frustration that conservatives feel over there being virtually no reductions in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which lifted the debt ceiling and was negotiated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden in late May. Members of the Freedom Caucus are also expected to push for several riders on the appropriation bills that would restrict abortion rights and eliminate funding for LGBTQ+ centers and diversity and inclusion programs.

But for the U.S. research community, that\u2019s the best-case scenario in the short run as Congress returns this month from its summer recess and tries to agree on spending levels for the 2024 fiscal year that begins on 1 October. The government could shut down if Republicans and Democrats don\u2019t declare a truce. The next federal budget is one of several topics affecting science that await action by this divided Congress, where Democrats hold a narrow edge in the Senate and Republicans have an equally small majority in the House of Representatives. Legislators are also debating proposals for greater oversight of research collaborations with China and restrictions on research that alters the characteristics of pathogens, as well as a bill setting new funding targets for agricultural research. Biomedical scientists are also hoping the Senate will confirm Monica Bertagnolli, nominated in May, as the new head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The 2024 budget is the most contentious issue facing lawmakers. With no prospect of passing all 12 bills that set new spending levels by 1 October, Democratic leaders in both houses and many Republicans are calling for a continuing resolution (CR) that would freeze budgets at this year\u2019s levels for a few months while negotiations continue. But some three dozen staunch conservatives in the House have pledged to oppose a CR. They want Congress to roll back spending to 2022 levels, which could cut some research programs by 20% or more. Democrats vow not to let that happen. If Congress can\u2019t pass a CR by 30 September, however, most government activities would grind to a halt. Such temporary shutdowns are not uncommon. There have been four since 1995, including for 35 days in 2018\u201319. Once those shutdowns ended, Congress ultimately approved catchall spending bills that usually included small increases for research. Achieving that benign outcome will be harder this year. In May, a deal to avoid defaulting on the $31 trillion federal debt included a provision that would reduce federal spending by 1% from this year\u2019s levels if Congress failed to approve a 2024 budget for all agencies by 30 April 2024. Given that pressure to hold down government spending, science advocates don\u2019t expect any agency to get more than a minimal increase at best when Congress finally passes a 2024 budget. For example, NIH would get a 2% boost, to $47.8 billion, if Congress eventually adopts a Senate proposal. But if a House spending panel has its way, NIH would get a 6% cut. At the same time, committees in both houses have proposed giving the National Science Foundation some $300 million less than the $9.87 billion it received this year.

That's perhaps the best assessment of the stock market in 2023 at this point. All the major indexes are in positive territory. The S&P 500 is on track to deliver its fourth double-digit percentage gain in the last five years. But don't rest too easily. There are three potential dangers for the stock market in September. Here's what they are -- and how investors can prepare. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Frothy valuations It's possible that the stock market could become a victim of its own success. The impressive performance this year for the S&P 500 has arguably led to a historically high valuation for the index. One of the best ways to assess the valuation of the S&P 500 is the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, also known as the Shiller PE ratio. Popularized by Yale professor Robert Shiller, this ratio compares the index's current share price to its real (inflation-adjusted) earnings per share averaged over a 10-year period. So, how does the Shiller PE ratio for the S&P 500 look these days? In a word, frothy. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts .

Some believe an impending economic slowdown will belie a reversal in equities. Others think this year\u2019s rally may have stronger legs than others give it credit for. Wall Street is abuzz over stock market predictions heading into the final quarter of a relatively strong year for equities. August\u2019s surprise downturn has led some to suspect an imminent correction heading further into September, historically the weakest month for stocks. Others are confident that stocks are bound to reach new highs before the new year. So, what\u2019s the outlook for the fourth quarter? Well, after August\u2019s mild pullback that saw the S&P 500 lose more than 4.5% of its value at its trough, it seems the bulls are back on parade. Indeed, from the S&P\u2019s bottom on Aug. 18, stocks are now up a little more than 2% since then. This also goes for the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite, which is up about 4% since it\u2019s August trough. The success of stocks in the final quarter of the year may well rest on the Federal Reserve. Despite the central bank\u2019s seemingly victorious battle against inflation, several Fed members (including Fed Chair Jerome Powell) have hinted at the possibility of more rate hikes to come. \u201cWe are prepared to raise rates further\n5. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Stock Market & Crypto Currency Update \u2013 September 5th, 2023\nbody: Bottom Line: My first rule of money is to never let your money and emotions cross paths.

Likewise, cryptos have created generational wealth for many who were early, however most investors in the crypto space have now lost money on their original investments.

A near-identical bill was introduced in Alabama this past legislative session, and while it failed to become law, the bill\u2019s co-sponsor, Rep. Jamie Kiel, R-Russellville, told Alabama Daily News Friday that were it reintroduced next session, it would have his full support. Known as the Adult Entertainment Act, Tennessee\u2019s law banning public drag shows \u2013 the first such law in the nation \u2013 was signed into law by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee in March. Its implementation was halted in June, however, after a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional. While the law is still being litigated in court, as of Thursday, it now has the official support of Marshall along with attorney generals from 17 other states. \u201cThere is nothing unconstitutional about a state protecting children from sexually explicit performances,\u201d Marshall said last week. \u201cTennessee\u2019s law is like many other longstanding laws that currently govern adult establishments. Contrary to Supreme Court precedent, the district court here was quick to attribute improper intentions to the Tennessee Legislature despite them having obvious and legitimate grounds to implement the law.\u201d The Tennessee law would make participating in drag shows within 1,000 feet of certain establishments like schools and parks a Class A misdemeanor for first-time offenders, punishable by up to a year in jail. A second offense would be a Class E felony, punishable by up to six years in prison. Alabama\u2019s House Bill 401 would similarly prohibit any \u201csexual or gender oriented\u201d demonstrations that include \u201clewd or lascivious dancing\u201d by \u201cdrag queens or drag kings,\u201d with first-time offenses carrying a penalty of up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $10,000.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee filed the lawsuit late Wednesday on behalf of an organization planning a Blount County Pride festival on Sept. 2. The ACLU is also representing drag performer Flamy Grant, who was hired to perform at the event. The plaintiffs are asking the federal court in eastern Tennessee to block the law from being enforced and declare it illegal. Earlier this year, a federal judge in Memphis ruled that Tennessee\u2019s so-called anti-drag show law was \u201cunconstitutionally vague and substantially overbroad,\u201d and encouraged \u201cdiscriminatory enforcement.\u201d The ruling was celebrated by LGBTQ advocates, but quickly sparked questions because the court declared the decision only applied to Shelby County, where Memphis lies. While some legal experts have speculated that district attorneys across the state wouldn\u2019t enforce a law that a federal judge said violated the First Amendment, others, including state Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, were quick to point out that the law remained in effect outside of Shelby County. The current tension is coming out of a rural county, some 395 miles east of Memphis, where District Attorney Ryan Desmond sent a letter to Blount County Pride organizers this week announcing that he planned to enforce the state\u2019s anti-drag law. \u201cIt is certainly possible that the event in question will not violate any of the criminal statutes,\u201d Desmond wrote. \u201cHowever if sufficient evidence is presented to this office that these referenced criminal statutes have been violated, our office will ethically and justly prosecute these cases in the interest of justice.\u201d The letter was addressed to the Pride organizers, as well as the county mayor, law enforcement groups and other public officials.

Wilson, along with support from Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia filed an amicus brief Tuesday to support the appeal of the ruling that the AEA was unconstitutional. In February, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed the Adult Entertainment Act, which bans drag performances and shows in public or where children are present. Offenders could face up to a year in prison and/or a fine of up to $2,500 , and repeat offenders could face prison sentences up to six years. In March, U.S. District Judge Thomas Parker temporarily blocked the law and then ruled it as unconstitutional in June. Tennessee has been the leader on the issue, as multiple states also have pushed or are pursuing drag performance restrictions or bans. In a news release Wednesday morning, Wilson said, \u201cContrary to what its critics say, the (Tennessee) law does not ban drag shows. By its own terms, the AEA applies only to certain forms of adult entertainment that are sexual or explicit performances, and the law does not even ban those performances. It simply requires this type of adult entertainment to occur in adult-only zones and prohibits such entertainment on public property.\u201d The February law was passed alongside other legislation affecting the LGBTQ+ community that bans gender affirming care for minors . Wilson\u2019s legal brief supporting the appeal of the Tennessee court ruling reads, in part, \u201c\u2026 The district court disregarded decades of precedent that respects the role of legislatures\u2014and state legislatures in particular\u2014in shaping public policy. The Tennessee legislature did not act with an impermissible purpose, and the Court\u2019s holding to the contrary undermines basic principles of separation of powers.

How\u2019s the Middle Class Scholarship going so far?\nbody: Stay up-to-date with free briefings on topics that matter to all Californians. Subscribe to CalMatters today for nonprofit news in your inbox. California cemented its status among the most affordable states to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree after lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom fulfilled their promise to expand the state\u2019s Middle Class Scholarship program by another $227 million in this year\u2019s budget deal. That overhauled scholarship, which debuted last year, is now a $859 million juggernaut. It\u2019s also a growing slice of the state\u2019s financial aid pie: Between 2016 and 2022 , California lawmakers poured roughly $1.4 billion more into grants and scholarships, bringing the state\u2019s total contribution to around $3.5 billion. Using new data that examines how the Middle Class Scholarship helped students in its first year, a CalMatters analysis shows that the grant worked largely as intended, sending more money to students of higher-income families. But the program has frustrated some advocacy groups, who want the state to spend more on lower-income students, especially those who are ineligible for existing state financial aid. For lawmakers grappling with a shaky state financial outlook while also attempting to rein in the cost of college, this is a tough needle to thread.

But that\u2019s not always what having a middle-class income in the United States looks like. Often, being in the middle class means acquiring a lot of debt, struggling to pay the mortgage, and living paycheck to paycheck. If that sounds like you, you are not alone. Here's why you might feel like you live in poverty even though you're considered to be middle-class in America. 10 Least Tax-Friendly States for Middle-Class Families Middle-Class Income Being in the middle class is something that many people and families have aspired to do over the years. In recent years, about half of people in the U.S. have been considered \"middle-class.\" Some people with middle-class incomes feel as though they are living in poverty, and the numbers corroborate those feelings. Data show that many \"middle-class\" families can't make ends meet or afford necessities in some cases. By the time you account for all the costs it takes to achieve middle-class status, you might not fare much better than those with incomes below the poverty line. The federal poverty level for a family of four is $30,000 in 2023. According to U.S. Census Bureau data , the median (middle-class) household income was $70,784 in 2021 (most recent statistics).

If you purchase anything through these affiliated links, 247wallst.com may earn a commission. The rising cost of living in the United States in recent years, coupled with longer-term stagnation of wages, have eroded the ranks of the American middle class - which has long been a pillar of stability and driver of growth in the U.S. economy. Typically, middle class households have disposable income for luxuries such as vacations and eating at restaurants, and are also able to put away money for savings and retirement. But because of economic conditions, households that fall in the middle of the income spectrum in much of the country may no longer meet some of these benchmarks of middle-class status. Using metro area level data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2021 American Community Survey, 24/7 Wall St. identified the city with the weakest middle class in each state. For the purposes of this story, the middle class is defined as the middle 20% of earners at the household level. For each state, the metro area with the lowest income ceiling for the middle quintile of earners ranks as having the poorest middle class. All data is for 2021. It is important to note that Delaware, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont are each home to only one metro area. As a result, the city listed for each of these states ranks as having the poorest middle class by default only.

With no shortage of threats facing the nation, a military promotion blockade in the Senate has emerged as a full-blown national security crisis. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is exercising his authority under Senate rules to halt the promotion of 270 senior military promotions. This number is poised to explode to 650 by the year\u2019s end. With just 852 general and flag officers in the U.S. military, 76% of the nation\u2019s most senior officers are on pace to not be Senate-confirmed by the end of the year. Why the delay? Tuberville disagrees with the Pentagon\u2019s reproductive health care access policy that was issued following the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision.

Freshman Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is holding scores of military appointments hostage because he doesn\u2019t want the Pentagon to pay the travel costs for service members seeking abortion care.

Week 1 of the 2023 NFL season is upon us. We all have freshly drafted fantasy football teams set to take us to a championship. Of course, things aren't that easy and your fantasy football lineups won't always go according to plan. One factor to account for is NFL injuries. To begin the season, things are likely at their calmest when it comes to the NFL Week 1 injury report \u2013 but we don\u2019t want to jinx ourselves. The notable NFL injury updates for Week 1 are headlined by Cooper Kupp, Joe Burrow, and George Kittle all being in danger of missing this week's games. We can feel more optimistic about some of the latest NFL injury news than others, but be sure to update your Week 1 fantasy football rankings and NFL projections either way. Now that your fantasy football drafts are in the books, it's time to focus on important Week 1 start/sit lineup decisions and fantasy football advice surrounding some injured players. It all starts with the NFL injury report as you set Week 1 fantasy football lineups. Week 1 NFL Injury Report for Quarterbacks Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals (Calf) Until the initial injury report comes out on Wednesday, all we have to go with is Zac Taylor labeling Joe Burrow as \u201cday to day.\" At this point, that is certainly more optimistic than we initially thought when Burrow went down in training camp with the calf injury. Now, we can feel good about the Cincinnati quarterback. The fact that Burrow is back at practice is huge. Additionally, this means we can move forward with the Bengals\u2019 skill position players as well. Just stay tuned in until later in the week to verify things after Burrow missed almost six weeks this summer. Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals (Knee) The hope is that no one was planning to rely on Murray to begin the season. For clarity, Murray appears to be set to start the year on the PUP list as he recovers from last year's torn ACL. So, we can move forward for the first month of the season at a minimum. If you are truly desperate in two-quarterback leagues, then Joshua Dobbs or Clayton Tune could have some value once we know who will start for the Cardinals. Things will be tough for Marquise Brown, and while the volume will be there for John Conner, it might be hard to find room to run. Week 1 NFL Injury Report for Running Backs Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts It has not been a smooth off-season for Taylor. Fantasy managers that drafted early in the summer will be without their running back for the first four games after Taylor was placed on the PUP list. Whether it's injury-related or due to the trade situation, he'll still be out for at least the first four games. The Colts will use a RB-by-committee in Taylor's absence.

No reason for concern. That theme characterized the answers of Rams receivers Monday when asked what it would be like to play the Seattle Seahawks without their star teammate, whose status for the season opener on Sunday is in doubt because of a lingering hamstring injury. Coach Sean McVay said Kupp was in Minnesota receiving an evaluation from unspecified experts. A decision on Kupp\u2019s availability for the opener \u2014 and beyond \u2014 was pending, he said. So the Rams, coming off a 5-12 season, are preparing for their opener without one of their few established stars. Kupp, quarterback Matthew Stafford and defensive lineman Aaron Donald are the pillars of a team that received no offseason infusion of star talent. If Kupp does not play against the Seahawks, then Van Jefferson, Tutu Atwell, rookie Puka Nacua or perhaps Ben Skowronek would start at receiver. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to operate with the situation and the guys that we do have,\u201d McVay said when asked about Kupp before practice in Thousand Oaks. \u201dAnd if he\u2019s able to go, that\u2019s outstanding for us. And if not, then that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been operating.\u201d Last season, Kupp caught 75 passes in nine games. Jefferson, Atwell and Skowroneck combined for 81 during the entire season. \u201cWe want Cooper to be healthy \u2014 if he\u2019s out there Week 1 that\u2019s great,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cWe know how important he is to the team and the locker room. \u201cBut if he\u2019s not able to play, we have to be able to work with the guys that we have. All of us are prepared, and had great camps and we\u2019re ready to go. We\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d Kupp, coming off season-ending ankle injury, did not participate in the voluntary offseason workout program so that he could be with his family as they awaited the birth of a third child. He suffered a hamstring injury early in training camp. Kupp participated in joint practices with the Denver Broncos before the final preseason game, but McVay said last week that the seventh-year pro suffered a setback. Kupp\u2019s absences have enabled other receivers to get extended work with Stafford. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have Cooper, it\u2019s tough for us as a team,\u201d Skowronek said. \u201cBut we\u2019re ready to step up.\u201d Kupp, 30, has come back from several injuries during his career. In 2018, he missed the Rams\u2019 run to Super Bowl LIII because of a season ending knee injury. In 2020, he suffered another knee injury that forced him to sit out an NFC divisional-round defeat loss to the Green Bay Packers. Kupp is seeking further evaluation of his latest injury because it has not gone \u201cin alignment\u201d with how similar injuries have or have not\n3. publish date: 2023-08-29, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Cooper Kupp fantasy outlook 2023: Should you draft the Rams' WR amidst injury concerns?\nbody: \"Ol' reliable\" was far from it in 2022, as Cooper Kupp played in fewer than 10 games for the second time in five seasons. Despite the injuries, the Rams receiver would still be a first-ballot inductee into the fictional Fantasy Football Hall of Fame. Kupp has provided some great moments \u2014 and great production \u2014 over the years to owners and bettors. His machine-like game has solidified the receiver near the top of draft boards for years and tormented defenses like no other. As the calendar flips to the 2023 season, suddenly Kupp's status is a question mark. On a team that's filled with uncertainty, fantasy owners are left to wonder if it's still worth drafting Kupp early or pivoting to the next big thing. A hamstring injury early in training camp only helped intensify those concerns. As drafts ramp up with the regular season fast approaching, Kupp might now be one of fantasy's biggest mysteries. Below, we'll break down Kupp's 2023 fantasy outlook and decide whether he's a smart draft pick in fantasy football leagues. DOMINATE YOUR DRAFT: Ultimate 2023 Fantasy Cheat Sheet Cooper Kupp injury update: How long will Rams' WR be out? UPDATE 8/31: Kupp reportedly suffered a \"setback\" in practice on Thursday and is considered \" day-to-day .\" Obviously, this puts his Week 1 status in jeopardy, but the \"day-to-day\" designation gives us hope he won't be out long, if at all. Football fans, fantasy owners, and the Rams all held their breath on Aug. 1 when it was reported that Kupp left practice with an injury. Details at the time were scarce before it was later announced to be a hamstring issue. The collective sigh of relief would've been enough to keep wind farms in California going for the foreseeable future, as Kupp would be fine. Just a few weeks later, the receiver was back at practice on Aug. 23. In fact, head coach Sean McVay gave what is likely the best news anyone could've hoped for. \"[H]e looked really good,\" McVay said . \"He looked like Cooper. And that\u2019s an excellent player for us.\" Barring a setback, Kupp is on track to play in Week 1 when the Rams visit the Seahawks. 2023 PPR RANKINGS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Ks | Top 200 | S-Flex | IDP Cooper Kupp's 2023 fantasy ranking and ADP Not much has gone right for the Rams since winning Super Bowl LVI, and you don't have to look much further than Kupp to find out why.

He had also pleaded guilty after his trial of attempting to intimidate witnesses during the trial. According to the Butte County District Attorney's Office, Peter Lee Flaming, 53, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with an additional 39 years to life after he serves those 20 years. Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said the jury took less than two hours to return guilty verdicts on all charges and special allegations. Ramsey said this case began last March when Butte County Sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a suspicious vehicle crash in the Thermalito area. When they arrived, deputies found the victim, 47, in the driver\u2019s seat of the crashed vehicle, bleeding profusely from three gunshot wounds. The victim told deputies he had been shot at a different location, but drove away until he lost control of his vehicle. Deputies were able to administer life-saving measures until medical personnel arrived and transported the victim to the hospital, where he received emergency surgery and ultimately recovered. Deputies learned in their investigation that the person who shot the victim was Flaming, a friend of the victim and that Flaming had shot the victim as the victim was exiting his vehicle that he slept in on Flaming\u2019s property in Thermalito. Deputies responded to Flaming\u2019s residence, but Flaming had fled the area. Later, Flaming was arrested without incident when he returned to his house and a good Samaritan reported seeing him. Ramsey said the evidence presented at the trial showed that Flaming had an ongoing disagreement with the victim over a mutual female friend, and on the morning of March 19, 2023, he exited his house and shot the victim three times. Flaming then fled the area. The gun was never recovered. Ramsey said that Flaming also pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to intimidate the victim and a key witness at his trial.

Welte in the U.S. District Court, Fargo, North Dakota. This sentencing follows a complex trial that revealed Um's involvement in a transnational drug trafficking organization responsible for distributing fentanyl and fentanyl analogues in the United States. The case, known as \"Operation Denial,\" underscores the serious consequences of international drug trafficking and the collaborative efforts to combat it. Background On April 11, 2023, Marie Um faced trial in Fargo, North Dakota, as part of a broader investigation into the trafficking of fentanyl and its analogues. Um was found guilty of several charges, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribute controlled substances, conspiracy to import controlled substances, and money laundering conspiracy. The jury determined that Um's actions had led to nine overdoses, including four deaths and five serious bodily injuries, in various states across the United States. Operation Denial \"Operation Denial\" is an Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation aimed at dismantling international fentanyl trafficking networks. This operation received crucial support from the Special Operations Division (S.O.D.) in Washington, DC, as part of \"Operation Deadly Merchant.\" The investigation was initiated in North Dakota in 2015 following an overdose death in Grand Forks, ND, involving Bailey Henke. The investigation's results As a result of Operation Denial, a total of 31 defendants have been charged in North Dakota, with an additional three defendants charged in Oregon.

Peter Wilby, 78, who previously worked as editor of the Independent on Sunday and the New Statesman, had 167 indecent images of children on his computer, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. When interviewed by police, Wilby admitted having viewed abuse material since the 1990s and said he had a sexual interest in children. After working as an education correspondent for various newspapers, Wilby joined The Independent on Sunday in 1990 and went on to become its editor. He was also the editor of the New Statesman from 1998 to 2005. Wilby has since written various columns for publications including The Guardian, with work published as recently as November last year. The journalist was charged with three counts of making indecent images of children, to which he later pleaded guilty, the NCA said. Investigators said he had been accessing the material online from his home in Essex. At Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday he was sentenced to ten months in prison, suspended for two years, and was placed on the sex offenders\u2019 register for five years. He was also ordered to undertake 40 hours rehabilitation and was handed a ten-year sexual harm prevention order. Adam Sprague, operations manager at the NCA, said: \u201cThe material accessed by Wilby and recovered from his computer showed real children being cruelly and sexually abused. \u201cHe was viewing this content while working as the editor of prominent national news outlets, a role in which he was entrusted to form the news agenda for the British public. A trust which he has greatly betrayed. \u201cWhile there is a global demand for this material, children will continue to be abused. The NCA is committed to tackling child sexual abuse in all its forms, to disrupt offenders and protect children.\u201d Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Sick Peter Wilby, 78, was this week sentenced after he was found in possession of 167 indecent images of children. Twenty-two of the pictures were classed as Category A images - the most serious. The former editor, who held top roles at the New Statesman and The Independent along with writing opinion pieces for The Guardian, later admitted he had an inappropriate interest in children while in top media positions. Wilby, who had been arrested by the National Crime Agency at his Essex home last October, was given a 10-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. The former editor was also given a rehabilitation requirement of 40 hours and is subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order. He was also placed on the sex offenders register for five years. The 78-year-old has written multiple columns slamming the media's coverage of paedophiles. His articles remain online to read, including those critical of investigations into paedophilia. The Guardian has today said it is reviewing Wilby's columns. In one article written in 2012, he suggests the \"hysteria\" around investigating paedophiles made those accused of child sex offences the new \"victims\". And he suggested victims of child abuse themselves would make false allegations \"in hope of substantial payments.\" In another piece entitled Prints of Darkness, published online in January 2007, Wilby slammed press campaigns that he thought weren't successful - including those investigating child paedophilia. And he suggested that campaigns that demanded greater transparency over the location of child sex offenders were unsuccessful. Wilby wrote: \"Since most child abuse is committed by parents and other close relatives in the first place.\" In another column, published online in 2008, he blasted the media's coverage of a children's care home in Jersey - describing the investigation into paedophiles as a \"witch-hunt\".

Engoron has kept to the date of the trial, set last year. The civil trial will be the first for Trump since he left the White House in 2021 and comes ahead of a slew of criminal trials the former president faces related to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and the improper handling of classified documents. The New York civil trial stems from a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James last year. James had filed the suit against Trump, three of his children and the Trump Organization, alleging an illegal scheme that amassed $250 million by fraudulently overvaluing assets. James seeks to recover $250 million she said was received through deceptive practices and aims to bar Trump and his children Eric, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., from serving as officers or directors in any New York company. Earlier this week, James asked Engoron to sanction Trump and his co-defendants $10,000 each for trying to delay the trial by repeatedly putting forward failed legal arguments. Trump has since demanded that James withdraw her motion for sanctions. \"The people will not accede to defendant's 'demand' that they withdraw their motion for sanctions,\" special counsel Andrew Amer said in a letter to the court Wednesday, obtained by UPI. Amer noted that the court had warned Trump for the second time against using \"borderline frivolous\" legal arguments and that the request to withdraw the motion for sanctions was in and of itself \"frivolous and sanctionable.\"\n2. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Trump keeps asking to move his March hush-money trial date because he's overbooked with criminal trials\nbody: Trump has repeatedly asked the judge in his NYC hush-money case to move the March 25 trial date. Trump's Jan. 6 trial is set for March 4 in DC, and will take more than a month, his lawyer argued. The NYC judge recently told Trump he won't move the date, but invited him to ask again in February. With two lengthy criminal trials scheduled for March, a lawyer for an overbooked Donald Trump has repeatedly asked the judge in the former president's Manhattan hush-money case to consider rescheduling, only to be rebuffed, court filings show. Instead of granting the requested scheduling conference, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan said earlier this month that he's sticking to the current trial date \u2014 at least for now. He invited Trump's lawyer to raise the matter of scheduling again in February. That means Trump remains on track for a March 4 trial, in Washington, DC, on conspiracy and obstruction charges related to the deadly Capitol riot. A Manhattan trial on charges that he lied in business documents to hide a 2016 hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels is scheduled to kick-off on March 25. Trump also has the March 5, Super Tuesday primaries to contend with. \"I have decided to adhere to the existing schedule,\" Merchan wrote earlier this month to Trump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche. \"We can discuss scheduling and make any necessary changes when we next meet on February 15, 2024.\" Trump's lawyers have had a run of bad luck in trying to talk Manhattan judges into delaying his trials. On Wednesday, the judge who will preside over Trump's October 2 civil business-fraud trial, New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, called a similar delay-the-date bid \"completely without merit.\" In asking, without luck, to at least talk about a new hush-money trial date, Blanche, too, sounded overbooked. The lawyer noted in an August 30 letter to Merchan that he is \"counsel of record\" for the DC case, the hush-money case, and \"another federal trial scheduled to begin on May 20, 2024,\" meaning the Mar-a-Lago documents trial in Florida. Federal prosecutors have estimated that the DC trial \u2014 not including jury selection \u2014 will span four to six weeks, Blanche told Merchan in his letter. \"Thus, the trial in that case will necessarily conflict with the scheduled trial in this case,\" Blanche noted. \"In order for President Trump's trial team to be ready for the D.C. trial in March 2024 \u2013 one that involves millions of documents, complex factual and legal issues, and is a mere 6 months away \u2013 it will require the full attention of President Trump's full legal team,\" Blanche told Merchan.

The massive mammal, weighing about 400 pounds, was first spotted around 7:20 a.m. Sunday at Hollywood Beach but swam over to the boat launch ramp, the Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute posted on Facebook . A CIMWI volunteer was able to safely remove the knife, which was embedded up to its handle, from the face of the adult California sea lion, the post read. The volunteer used a pole with a hook blade and managed to catch the belt cutter slot on the knife and pulled it out. \u201cThankfully, the knife missed all vital structures of the sea lion\u2019s face and the wound will heal on its own,\u201d officials said. The male sea lion then jumped off the dock and swam around until it hopped up on a nearby dock finger to sun himself. \u201cThis sea lion now has a second chance at life,\u201d officials said. There was no word on how the knife ended up in the sea lion\u2019s face, or if any suspects were being sought.

AFP spoke on the eve of its release to the three co-chairs of the report, approved last week in Berlin by the 143 member nations of IPBES, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The co-chairs are ecologist Helen Roy, a professor at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; Peter Stoett, dean of Social Sciences and Humanities at Ontario Tech University; and Anibal Pauchard, a professor at the University of Concepcion in Chile. The following has been condensed and edited for clarity. Q. You conclude that the number of invasive species is rising at an \"unprecedented rate\". Can you quantify that? Roy: The problem is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. On current \"business-as-usual\" trends, we anticipate an increase of 36 percent by 2050.

Sign up for InsideNoVa.com\u2019s free email subscription today. A new report is underscoring the increase in Northern Virginia families struggling to afford basic needs. In 2021, 20% of families in the region did not earn enough money for shelter, food, medical care and other essentials. Another 9% could not afford child care in addition to these needs. The report comes from the Community Foundation of Northern Virginia\u2019s research arm, Insight Region. It says recent inflation has pushed many families into what is called income inadequacy. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from December 2020 to December 2021, gasoline prices rose nearly 50%, food prices rose more than 6% and rent rose over 3%. A year and a half later, families are still feeling the effects of inflation despite its recent cooling. \u201cIn the first half of 2023, a third of families in Northern Virginia reported difficulty paying the bills,\u201d the report states.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) announced that the federal government\u2019s budget deficit more than doubled through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year compared to last year.

The Congressional Budget Office noted that federal spending was 10% higher during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2023, while tax revenues came in 10% lower, which resulted for the deficit to widen.

As that process reaches its home stretch on September 5 and 20, when the first and last readings on the issue take place, respectively, at council meetings, what can residents expect? The first point to highlight is that the community was able to see the budget projection in a workshop organized on August 15, in which each department made its presentation. It was revealed that the proposed general fund total budget for the next fiscal year is of $77,105,320. This represents a general increase of 14.14% compared to the previous year. It should be noted that, although the budget proposed in said session hasn\u2019t been approved nor has any decision been made in this regard, it\u2019s in line with the city\u2019s strategic plan. It reflects the vision that the Doral council has on how to provide a better service to the community.

Despite being a federal program, SNAP payments are administered by state governments, so eligibility conditions and amounts vary depending on the beneficiary\u2019s residence state. For families that struggle to feed their families, SNAP help provides monthly food stamps. The amount mostly relies on the circumstances of each family in addition to the size of the household. No matter how much the recipients get, the funds are transferred to an EBT debit card, that is recognized in some marketplaces and retail locations. Eligibility For SNAP Benefits Based on a 2023 analysis by the left-leaning research tank Center for Budget & Policy Priorities, households must be or lower than 130% of the poverty line set by the government to be eligible for SNAP assistance, which works out to nearly $2,500 per month for a household of three. States are crucial in identifying who is eligible for SNAP assistance and in distributing payments. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has data up to April 2023, and during that month, approximately 42 million Americans received SNAP benefits.

Zimbabweans went to polls on Aug. 23 to elect a new president, parliamentarians and local council members, but the main opposition party described the results as a \"gigantic fraud\". In his speech after being sworn in, Mnangagwa pleaded for unity in the aftermath of the polls, promising to revive the ailing economy. \"Responsive policies which begun in the first term of my presidency are on course to lift many out of poverty,\" Mnangagwa said. Thousands of Mnangagwa's supporters, mostly bussed in from across the country, sang and danced as the 80-year-old walked into the National Sports Stadium alongside his wife. He took oath of office in front of Chief Justice Luke Malaba who in 2018 declared Mnangagwa as winner following a constitutional court challenge. \"I stand as a president of all. I offer you individually and collectively, unity,\" Mnangagwa said.

Zimbabwe Election Commission (ZEC) announced on Aug. 26 that incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa had defeated his opponent, Nelson Chamisa, with 52.6 percent of the vote and was duly elected for a second term. Mnangagwa\u2019s ZANU-PF party, which has controlled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, also won 136 of the 209 contested National Assembly seats. But if Mnangagwa thought he had managed to control the election observation process this time, including with disinformation planted in state-owned news media, he was in for a surprise. Even before the results were made public, the five principal organizations observing Zimbabwe\u2019s 2023 elections \u2013 Africa Union, Commonwealth, European Union, Southern African Development Community (SADC), and Carter Center \u2014 offered preliminary statements regarding the conduct of the electoral process.

REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo 2/4 HARARE (Reuters) -Partial results from Zimbabwe's parliamentary election suggested the ruling party's lead was growing on Friday, but election observers said the vote did not meet international standards and was conducted in a \"climate of fear\". President Emmerson Mnangagwa's ZANU-PF party was widely expected to maintain its 43-year grip on power after Zimbabweans voted in a parliamentary and presidential poll on Wednesday. A tally by state broadcaster ZBC showed ZANU-PF winning 101 parliamentary constituencies and the main opposition party Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) winning 59, out of a total of 210. The result of the presidential vote has not been announced yet. It is expected within five days of voting.

Russia-North Korea cooperation may extend beyond conventional arms deals and food/energy assistance, possibly to advanced technology for satellites, nuclear-power submarines, and ballistic missiles. A Russia-North Korea axis complicates the security picture both in Ukraine and on the Korean peninsula. Even technical support by the Russian military to advance or modernize North Korea\u2019s conventional forces could embolden Kim to adopt more coercive, even lethal use of force. The United States and its allies have limited policy options in addressing this new challenge. The White House\u2019s acknowledgement of intelligence indicating a possible meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on September 10-13 to advance ongoing arms negotiations is only the latest evidence of a growing military alignment between the two countries. Last week, the National Security Council announced that the two leaders had exchanged letters pledging to increase their bilateral cooperation and that the two countries were actively advancing negotiations to assist Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, joined by her counterparts from Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom, condemned such negotiations as a violation of UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea (UNSC 1874 and 2270). In January 2023, the White House released satellite imagery of arms transfers from North Korea to the Wagner paramilitary group taking place at the Tumangang\u2013Khasan railroad crossing on November 18 and 19 of last year.

In return, experts said, North Korea will likely want food and energy shipments and transfers of sophisticated weapons technologies. A meeting with Putin would be Kim\u2019s first summit with a foreign leader since North Korea closed its borders in January 2020. They met for the first time in April 2019, two months after Kim\u2019s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with then-U.S. President Donald Trump collapsed. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to Pyongyang in July and asked Kim to send more ammunition to Russia, according to U.S. officials. Shoigu said Moscow and Pyongyang were considering holding military exercises for the first time. It\u2019s unclear how far Kim and Putin\u2019s military cooperation could go, but any sign of warming relations will worry rivals like the U.S. and South Korea.

Some 192 high-powered lasers zeroed in on a diamond-coated target about the size of a peppercorn at the lab's National Ignition Facility on July 30, creating a reaction that resulted in a greater amount of energy coming out than the amount of energy put in, hence the net gain. San Diego-based General Atomics assisted in the experiment by making the target capsule and its assemblies. Physics Today magazine , from the American Institute of Physics, cited three sources who preferred not to be identified who said the July laser shot deposited 2.05 megajoules onto the target, yielding 3.88 megajoules of energy, with an uncertainty of 0.31 megajoules. That's about a 20 percent increase from the December shot, which produced 3.15 megajoules. Lawrence Livermore officials have been reticent to reveal many details but have confirmed the July experiment came back with improved results. \"As is our standard practice, we plan on reporting these results at upcoming scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed publications,\" the lab said in a statement.

UC Santa Barbara alum Sarah Nelson, acting office director of the Office of Experimental Sciences at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), helped oversee and manage the research and development program that achieved this. \u201cFusing those atoms together is not something mother nature wants to do naturally, requiring extreme temperatures and pressures to overcome the repulsion between the nuclei,\u201d explained Nelson. \u201cFusion is the power source of the Sun and other stars, where hydrogen nuclei such as deuterium (D) and tritium (T) are fused into helium. Researchers focus on DT reactions both because they produce large amounts of energy and they occur at lower temperatures than other elements.\u201d The experiment was successfully replicated by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in August\n5. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Stay Informed, Santa Clara: September 2023 City Hall News Now Available\nbody: The City Hall News is a digital newsletter for Santa Clara residents.

It would be the first new cemetery in Alameda County in three decades. \u201cNot many people get a chance to do this from scratch,\u201d said Andy Martinez, the cemetery and funeral home consultant for Monte Vista Memorial Gardens, which is set for development in unincorporated north Livermore. \u201cAnd (it\u2019s) a very pivotal moment with all the changing trends.\u201d Alameda County supervisors approved a conditional use permit for the cemetery and funeral home project, which has been in the planning stages for almost 10 years. It is being developed by Monte Vista Memorial Investment Group. After it acquires licenses and building permits, Martinez said the cemetery could begin accommodating interments, or burials, in the first quarter of next year. Many of the cemeteries in Alameda County were developed in the 19th century. Most recently, the Five Pillars Farm Cemetery, which provides services for Muslim burials in Livermore, was founded in 1996. Before that, Cedar Lawn Memorial Park in Fremont was started in 1967. \u201cCalifornia hasn\u2019t had the need because it was the\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Elon indicates they will target 10 flights per month for the 4 remaining months of the year to hopefully reach 100 launches. They will tehn increase to 12 per month in 2024 which would get SpaceX to 140-150 launches in 2024. This is before SpaceX gets the Starship and Super Heavy working. Starship and Super Heavy being fully reusable and able to hold ten times the mass will greatly accelerate launches and multiply launch payload. Above is a photo of the various Starship prototypes by John Cargile @GroundTruthPics for WAI (what About It?). SpaceX has launched 12 Starshield satellites for the US government Space Force. Nine of those Starshield satellites are working.

The record was achieved when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched from the Kennedy Space Center, deploying 21 Starlink internet satellites. This surpasses SpaceX's prior record set last year at 61 launches, edging the company close to its objective of 100 rocket launches this year. SpaceX plans to accelerate its rate to 10 missions per month later this year and aims for 12 launches per month in the coming year. The Starship, portrayed as the most powerful rocket ever designed, is being prepared for potential launch. Additionally, the first commercial spacewalk led by Jared Isaacman, who formerly spearheaded the Inspiration 4 Mission, is in the pipeline. This ongoing success accentuates SpaceX's contributions to private space exploration and innovation. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, has ambitious targets, aiming to bring an increase in private rocket launch frequency and reliability comparable to government space agencies.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. In less than a day after launching NASA's Crew 7 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), SpaceX flew its Falcon 9 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The launch was SpaceX's 59th for 2023 and its 258th overall mission, indicating that it is unlikely that the firm will meet its self-set target of launching 100 rockets this year. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket was already vertical on the pad yesterday at the time of the Crew 7 launch, and if the company is to launch 100 missions this year, then it will have to launch one more mission this year and at least ten missions per month for the remainder of 2023. SpaceX Has Launch Nearly As Many Launches In 2023 So Far As It Did In Full Year 2022 Even though SpaceX might not launch 100 missions this year, the firm has grown its launch cadence this year compared to the last. In 2022, the company had launched 61 missions, and with potentially two more launches left before August closes, it appears that SpaceX will have met its 2022 cadence by the end of this month. A large portion of SpaceX's launch manifest is made of Starlink launches, and recent trends indicate that the firm will have to step up the pace of these launches, too. This is because the number of satellites that SpaceX launches with each mission has rapidly dropped since the firm finished building out the first generation portion of its constellation. The satellites part of the second generation constellation are significantly bigger than their predecessors and naturally take more space inside the Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX's plans for its second-generation constellation have penned in using Starship for the launches, and so far, there are few signs that the rocket will be operational by the end of this year. The Falcon 9 lifted off at 9:05 pm local\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

But making predictions is never easy in this sport. Alabama had made seven of the previous eight playoffs entering last season before missing out. The Big Ten got two teams in for the first time. The Big 12 finally got a representative other than Oklahoma. However, it wasn't Texas. It was TCU, which shockingly made the title game after beating Michigan in the semifinals. Southern California's Caleb Williams entered last season as one of the favorites for the Heisman Trophy. His biggest competition was expected to be Alabama's Bryce Young, who won the award in 2021. Instead, it was TCU's Max Duggan who finished second and Young was sixth. Among the major disappointments were Texas A&M, Oklahoma and Baylor. All three started in the preseason top 10 and finished with a losing record. On the positive side, there was TCU and the unlikely run of Tulane into the top 10. Also starting outside the Top 25 were Tennessee, Penn State and LSU. All five finished in the top 15.

It will be the final year we have a four-team playoff before the postseason expands to 12 teams, the last with the concept of a New Year's Six bowl game, and the last with anything resembling the Pac-12 as that conference looks to be doomed after another dramatic round of realignment . This year's postseason kicks off on Dec. 16 with seven bowl games on tap and runs through Jan. 8 to determine the national championship live from Houston. The semifinal games, at the Rose Bowl and the Sugar Bowl, will take place on New Year's Day.

Cotton Bowl prediction The game: USC vs. Texas The word: Our first look at the Trojans defense still left a lot to be desired, in the opener allowing over 200 rushing yards and some big plays downfield to San Jose State, a weakness that should still keep this team out of the College Football Playoff, even considering its prolific offense. We project the Longhorns will pull out the Big 12 title in their final year before departing for the SEC. Early game pick: USC Peach Bowl prediction The game: LSU vs. Tulane The word: We project LSU will finish second in the SEC West title race this season with games against Florida State and Alabama in road atmospheres that can go either way, but this is still one of the most talented teams in the nation top to bottom with a ton of returning talent. Tulane is our favorite from the Group of Five, returning Michael Pratt at quarterback and the AAC's best offensive line. Early game pick: LSU Orange Bowl prediction The game: Ohio State vs. Florida State The word: We predict the Buckeyes will fall to Michigan a third straight time and fall out of the playoff race as a result, drawing instead what would still be an intriguing matchup against our projected ACC title game loser, the Seminoles and their highly experienced roster\n3. publish date: 2023-08-25, Friday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: College Football predictions 2023: Conference champions, playoff teams, national title winner\nbody: This is the final season of college football as we know it.

The Tigers have a loaded defense led by Jeremiah Trotter Jr., too. We're just enamored with Florida State and an offense that features quarterback Jordan Travis, running back Trey Benson and receivers Keon Coleman and Johnny Wilson. South Carolina transfer tight end Jaheim Bell could be yet another breakout player. Travis has all of that to work with, and we think Florida State gets a split with those huge games and stays on course through an ACC championship.

Fast forward to 2023, and the conference will attempt to get back to the College Football Playoff after a couple of seasons sitting out on the fun. With that being said, it is time to check out our college football odds series where our 2023 ACC Winner prediction and pick will be revealed. Last season, the Clemson Tigers returned to their rightful thrown and captured their seventh conference title crown in the past eight seasons by defeating the North Carolina Tar Heels in the Championship Game. Incredibly enough. the Tigers led by Dabo Swinney have dominated the ACC and are once again the team to beat with +150 odds to win the conference. However, with the up-and-coming Florida State Seminoles and a multitude of talented squads residing in the conference ready to raise some eyebrows in 2023, the ACC should be as competitive as it gets. Here are the college football odds, courtesy of FanDuel. College Football Odds: 2023 ACC Winner Clemson: +150 Florida State: +170 Pittsburgh: +1100 North Carolina: +1100 Why Clemson Will Win the ACC For obvious reasons, Clemson has become a household name in this conference since head coach Dabo Swinney took the helm in 2009. With the best recruiting classes, a marvelous home-field advantage at Memorial Stadium, and a pair of National Championships coming during the 2016 and 2018 seasons, it is safe to say that this Tigers football program is here to stay for the foreseeable future. The main thing that plagued the Tigers in 2022 was far too inconsistent quarterback play. Not only is having a steady quarterback under center the name of the game if you want to be successful, but Clemson has gotten to the point of their program where even 11 wins a season is considered a failure due to such lofty national championship hopes.

And we, frankly, had run out of service providers,\" said Healey on Monday. The Commonwealth has more than 6,000 families in emergency shelters, including pregnant mothers and children. Many have come to Massachusetts in recent months as migrants from countries such as Haiti. \"I am very focused on securing more funding from the Biden administration. I have made that specific request. Number two, I'm focused on work authorizations. All of these people want to work. We've got a workforce shortage in the state. We've got employers who are dying to get people to work,\" Healey said.

The men and women, many with children, ate Popeyes and ramen and washed their clothes in the bathroom sink. Toddlers used brooms as toys. The lucky ones slept on cots, but most made do with thin blankets spread among bags and piles of trash. Alejandra Meneces, 30, from Venezuela, said she\u2019d been waiting at O\u2019Hare with her husband and son for almost a week. \u201cWe came here for our own dignity,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we want to do more than anything is work.\u201d If the past 12 months are any indicator, it\u2019s deeply uncertain if Meneces will find either anytime soon. One year since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused the first group of asylum-seekers to Chicago \u2014 arguing that liberal northern cities that profess to be sanctuaries should welcome them \u2014 what began as political gamesmanship is now a full-blown humanitarian crisis: As of Friday, more than 6,600 migrants were lodging at city-run shelters, with another 1,576 sleeping in police stations and more than 400 camped at O\u2019Hare. More than 13,500 asylum-seekers have arrived in the past year, often with no money and few belongings. With Chicago already struggling to absorb such numbers, Mayor Brandon Johnson warned Wednesday that the city can\u2019t continue safely welcoming more migrants \u201cwithout significant support and immigration policy changes.\u201d Neighborhood resistance to shelters, both for their disruption and strain on public resources, also continues to flare up.

As a result, the Adams administration is once again calling for changes to a policy that requires the city to provide shelter to migrants. \"There\u2019s a wide-open front door right now,\" Deputy Mayor Anne Williams-Isom said at a press briefing. For more than a year, the city has scrambled to feed, clothe, and even educate more than 110,000 migrants who have passed through New York City since the spring of 2022. Nearly 60,000 migrants are currently in the city\u2019s care and around 19,000 migrant children are headed to city schools this week. The Adams administration argues that the right to shelter policy which requires the city to provide housing to anyone who needs it is putting the city in an impossible situation. This policy is currently being debated in court with Legal Aid and the state. \"You're going to get a hotel room, you're going to get school, open arms and while we love that, and we are so proud of that, I think in a way it's being used against us,\" Williams-Isom said. \"If we didn't have the right to shelter, I think we would still get people but I think that it would be a little less.\" The city is now opening its 16th large-scale humanitarian relief center at Austell Place in Long Island City. The city is still working on getting this building up to code, but more than 300 migrants will be moved in on Wednesday while construction will continue on the lower floors. \"At full capacity, Austell Place will be able to serve nearly 1000 people, offering not only a safe place to sleep, but also food medical care, and help from social service workers,\" HPD Commissioner Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, Jr. said.

The mayor's office said the Hyde Park hotel could house up to 300 migrants. The city is struggling with the constant influx of migrants. That hotel was chosen, in part, because it previously housed migrants earlier this year. But some neighbors say there were problems back then with noise, cleanliness, and even drug use. In Hyde Park, the spokesperson for the Office of Emergency Management said Lake Shore Hotel will house migrants. At a standing room only meeting between city officials and Hyde Park residents, there were angry words and heated confrontation over the plans. \"I don't want them there!\" said one woman. \"Take them someplace else or send them back to Venezuela! I don't care where they go!\" ABC7 Political Analyst Laura Washington has more in the efforts to help migrants in Chicago. \"This is a generous city. We are a city of immigrants,\" said another woman. \"We believe that every community should support the asylum seekers,\" another woman said. Some Hyde Park residents welcome stable options for families who have just arrived. \"I think we do have enough resources to welcome these people properly, but we have to make a decision to use our wealth that way,\" said Saba Ayman-Nolley, president of the Hyde Park Kenwood Interfaith Council. Some residents near the hotel did not want to go on camera, but are concerned about this already congested area and the unhoused residents already struggling. \"I don't say anything about taking care of other people, but you take care of your own first. Don't you? Don't you take care of you own before you take care of somebody else?\" Hyde Park resident Cornell Tyler said. Officials say the Lake Shore Hotel will be used as a shelter for six months, and the migrants staying there will be families with children, many with medical needs. The city is a step closer to buying 3034 W. Foster Ave., currently owned by the Water Reclamation District. At the last Water Reclamation Board meeting, it was discussed as a potential place to house migrants. The deal goes before the full City Council next month.

ESPN Stats & Info noted Gauff is the first American teenager to reach the U.S. Open semifinals since Serena Williams in 2001. Gauff was one of five American-born players (men and women) who reached the quarterfinals, most in the U.S. Open since 2017. That was also the last time an American woman won this tournament (Sloane Stephens). This is already the best season of Gauff's young career. She has 39 singles match wins and three tournament victories. The Florida native had more singles titles in 2023 than she had in the previous four years combined (two). A Grand Slam title is the only thing Gauff hasn't won this year. She reached the quarterfinals at the French Open before losing to No. 1 seed Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in straight sets.

The proposed scheduling order sets March 4, 2024 as the commencing trial date. If approved, the trial would begin eight days before Georgia\u2019s presidential primary on March 12, and just one day before Super Tuesday, when the greatest number of states hold its primary elections and caucuses. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is the prosecutor leading the case, also requested an arraignment date of September 5, 2023. Legal counsel for Trump and his co-defendants would then have until September 29 to submit any discovery materials. Willis has already set a deadline of noon on Aug. 25 for all 19 defendants to turn themselves in at the Fulton County Jail for booking. The case has been assigned to newly-appointed Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who was nominated to fill a vacancy on the bench earlier this year by Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp. \u201cIn light of defendant Donald Trump\u2019s other criminal and civil matters pending in the courts of our sister sovereigns, the state of Georgia proposes certain deadlines that do not conflict with these other courts\u2019 already scheduled hearings and trial dates,\u201d Willis\u2019s motion states. \"Further, the proposed dates are requested so as to allow the Defendants\u2019 needs to review discovery and prepare for trial but also to protect the State of Georgia\u2019s and the public\u2019s interest in a prompt resolution of the charges for which the Defendants have been indicted.\" As legal challenges from the defendants are likely to arise over the coming months, the proposed dates could potentially change even if approved by the judge. One of the defendants, Trump's former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, already filed a motion on Tuesday seeking to transfer the case from state to federal court. Meadows argued that because the alleged actions he took were during his time as a government official, he should be granted immunity from prosecution. During a press conference on Monday, Willis said she\u2019s aiming for a trial date to be within the next six months and intends to try all 19 defendants together, which could cause for a lengthy and challenging trial. In another unrelated high-profile RICO case brought by Willis against several defendants including hip-hop artist \"Young Thug,\" a single juror has yet to be seated since jury selection began in January. If the requested trial date is approved, the federal trial for Trump's alleged criminal attempt to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election will have already begun.

The disclosures, made Wednesday in the case's first televised hearing, underscore the complexity of the sweeping racketeering probe. Jury selection in another Georgia RICO case, prosecuting the rapper Young Thug and others, has taken months. Wednesday's hearing, in front of Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, was to consider certain defendants' efforts to be tried alone. McAfee denied the efforts by Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell to separate their cases.

Laraine Newman, Belzer\u2019s longtime friend and fellow SNL cast member, confirmed his passing on Sunday. Writer Bill Scheft, another longtime friend of the actor, said Belzer died early Sunday at his home in Bozouls in southwest France. \u201cHe had lots of health issues, and his last words were, \u2018Fuck you, motherfucker,'\u201d Scheft told The Hollywood Reporter. A native of Bridgeport, Connecticut, Belzer began his career as a stand-up comedian in the 1970s, quickly winning over audiences thanks to his sharp wit and acerbic style. In 1975 he was hired to serve as the warmup comedian for SNL\u2019s inaugural season, and proceeded to make several guest appearances throughout the show\u2019s first five seasons. In the 1980s, Belzer had small roles in films like Fame and Scarface. He also appeared in music videos for Mike + The Mechanics (\u201cTaken In\u201d), Pat Benatar (\u201cLe Bel Age\u201d), and Kansas (\u201cCan\u2019t Cry Anymore\u201d). In the 1990s, Belzer transitioned back to television with roles on The Flash, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, and Homicide: Life on the Street. It was the latter role \u2014 as detective John Munch \u2014 that would come to define Belzer\u2019s career. Belzer ended up portraying Munch for 22 consecutive seasons.

When even other Law & Order series fell to cancelation, the trials and tribulations of Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) continued. Hargitay\u2019s real-life advocacy for survivors of sex crimes as well as the ripped-from-the-headlines storytelling has kept the series going for the past two decades. And even casting shake-ups of fan-favorite characters have not lessened fan appreciation for the series. If anything, the series has become more popular, especially with the return of hot-headed original cast member \u2013 Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni). Things are hotter than ever between the two former partners when Stabler does double duty between SVU and his series, Law & Order: Organized Crime. Now, heading into season 25, viewers are clamoring to know when they can see their favorite characters again. Release window While a new season of Law & Order: SVU is guaranteed going forward, the exact timing of season 25 is less clear. Typically a new season of the crime procedural airs on the fall schedule, but recent developments in the entertainment industry have made that less certain. The dual strike in Hollywood has continued since May, ensuring that not only writers are unable to contribute, but actors as well. The AMPTP has recently enlisted the services of yet another PR team, meaning that it could be some time before we see a new season of the series. In the best-case scenario, fans can expect season 25 to air in the 2024 winter schedule at the earliest, but that has yet to be determined.

Meloni left the series at the end of SVU\u2018s twelfth season, so his character Elliot Stabler retired from the police force off-screen in the Season 13 premiere. Fans clamored for his return, and in April 2020, an announcement was made that Christopher Meloni agreed to return in his famous detective role on a new SVU spinoff series. This new show, called Law & Order: Organized Crime, would follow Stabler coming out of retirement to head up an NYPD task force on organized crime. This was great news to Elliot Stabler fans! This new series wouldn\u2019t just focus on Elliot Stabler\u2019s detective work. However, to personalize the fan favorite, series producers decided to focus on Stabler\u2019s personal life in addition to following his police work. This brought to the fore several characters in Stabler\u2019s family, including his son Elliot Stabler, Jr. So, who is this character, and what happened to him on the show? The character Elliot Stabler, Jr., called Eli by his friends and family and played by Nicky Torchia, was born in 2007 and is Elliot and Kathy Stabler\u2019s youngest child. He has four siblings: Kathleen, Elizabeth, Maureen, and Dickie.

Law & Order: SVU Season 25 isn\u2019t coming this month, but when will it arrive? Fall TV is set to return, but it\u2019s looking very different to normal. We have some bad news for fans of the Dick Wolf shows. None of them are coming back this month, and that includes Law & Order: SVU Season 25. That just means we\u2019re waiting for a month, right? After all, we\u2019ve seen that Quantum Leap and Magnum PI will be back in October. This is where the bad news continues. We\u2019re not going to see new episodes of SVU for the rest of the year. When will Law & Order: SVU Season 25 premiere on NBC? Why would NBC change the schedule so dramatically? Is it a bad sign for the Law & Order franchise? Not at all! NBC didn\u2019t want to change Thursdays too much. This is all linked to the current strike action. Back in May, NBC hoped for things to work out to bring a normal fall. The new schedule didn\u2019t come out until July when the actors joined the writers on strike. There has been little movement since then, and it means that NBC has no choice but to hold off a lot of the scripted content until next year. We don\u2019t know when next year. Maybe there is a chance of the show returning in January. This is all going to depend on when production restarts and when the episodes will be ready. We\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on things. The good news is NBC will bring some Law & Order reruns to kick off Thursday nights. We will also get new episodes of new shows The Irrational and Found and new episodes of Magnum PI.

After two years of decline, deaths by suicide increased in the United States in 2021, and provisional data from the CDC points to further increases in 2022. Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States, but research shows it can be prevented.

While it's not five times better than it was that time around, it has certainly closed the gap in talent as well as form. Three golfers have won three or more times on either the PGA Tour or European Tour over the last 12 months, and all three will be competing for the European team in Rome. \"I think Europe is very strong this year,\" said 2021 captain Padraig Harrington at the Irish Open this week. \"I think we're back -- I believe we're back to the '80s, the '70s where our top players are actually the best players in the world.

Labor problems. Southwest Airlines has yet to reach an agreement with its pilots, and neither has American Airlines with its flight attendants. Experts, and the flying public, are both concerned about the two carriers. Both groups have authorized a strike. In fact, Google searches for \u2018American Airlines flight attendants\u2019 shot up more than 1,300 percent since August 31. Clearly, people are interested as the winter holidays loom. The country simply can\u2019t afford to have 40 percent of its major airlines sidelined. Southwest is facing a double whammy. It not only has to come to an agreement with its pilots but with its flight attendants as well. But somebody has to fly the planes so it will likely focus on its problems with its pilots\u2019 union first. Southwest pilots and American Airlines flight attendants are currently in federal mediation. It is of some solace that neither group can go on strike while in federal mediation. Both groups have been seen picketing at airports. \"Southwest pilots are ready to strike,\" the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association wrote on its X (formerly Twitter) page. Said Southwest in a statement after a recent pilot demonstration: \"Southwest Airlines respects the rights of our employees to express their opinions, and we do not anticipate any disruption in service because of today\u2019s demonstration of off-duty pilots.

You can expect widespread disruption not only to flights set to land and take off at various French airports but also to those that utilize the country\u2019s airspace if the strike on September 15, 2023, goes forward. Several unions in France represent Air Traffic Controllers, and so far, only the largest one, SNCTA, has given the strike notice, but other unions may join. The union is also planning another work stoppage on October 13, 2023. You should pay attention to this possible strike, especially if you plan to fly to/from/via/over France on the strike date, as there will be many canceled and delayed flights. The EU\u2019s EC 261/2004 legislation required community airlines and those flying from EU/EEA to rebook affected passengers to their final destinations at the earliest opportunity and to provide Duty to Care (hotels and meals) in case of long delays. Conclusion It has been relatively quiet in the work stoppage sector in Europe in the past couple of months, but I assume that strike activity will return now that the summer travel season is over. You should pay attention to these strikes because they affect long-haul flights before and after the strike day and may lead to missed connections and ruined travel plans\n3. publish date: 2023-08-30, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Why, When and Where American Airlines, Southwest Airlines Workers Are Picketing This Week\nbody: Two airline work groups at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport are picketing this week after stalled negotiations have left them without a contract.

American\u2019s more than 26,000 flight attendants recently voted for a strike, although it would take a few more legal steps to actually conduct a strike under the Railway Labor Act, and will share results of the vote at the picket. The flight attendants union filed for federal mediation in March with the National Mediation Board, for their contract that they started discussions on in 2019. If approved, the strike authorization vote would allow the union to call a strike, but only after getting the go-ahead fromthe National Mediation Board.

NBC has renewed Law & Order: SVU for a record setting 25th season, which makes it the rare spin-off to be longer than the original, but fans will have to wait quite a while before they get it.

January would be the obvious best case scenario, as fans would have to wait the least amount of time, and still be able to get a half season worth of new episodes (January marks the mid-season for fall programming).

Law & Order: SVU Season 25 isn\u2019t coming this month, but when will it arrive? Fall TV is set to return, but it\u2019s looking very different to normal. We have some bad news for fans of the Dick Wolf shows. None of them are coming back this month, and that includes Law & Order: SVU Season 25. That just means we\u2019re waiting for a month, right? After all, we\u2019ve seen that Quantum Leap and Magnum PI will be back in October. This is where the bad news continues. We\u2019re not going to see new episodes of SVU for the rest of the year. When will Law & Order: SVU Season 25 premiere on NBC? Why would NBC change the schedule so dramatically? Is it a bad sign for the Law & Order franchise? Not at all! NBC didn\u2019t want to change Thursdays too much. This is all linked to the current strike action. Back in May, NBC hoped for things to work out to bring a normal fall. The new schedule didn\u2019t come out until July when the actors joined the writers on strike. There has been little movement since then, and it means that NBC has no choice but to hold off a lot of the scripted content until next year. We don\u2019t know when next year. Maybe there is a chance of the show returning in January. This is all going to depend on when production restarts and when the episodes will be ready. We\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on things.

Is there news on a premiere date coming soon? Well, the first thing that we should note here is that if you\u2019re looking forward to seeing Olivia Benson back this year, you are going to be disappointed. It became clear a little while ago that the entire franchise was not going to be on the NBC fall schedule. The earliest that you will see the show back is mid-to-late January and, odds are, it is going to be later than that. Just remember that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes are still ongoing and as far as we are aware, there is no apparent end to these in strike. The first thing that needs to happen in order to get production underway is for everyone involved to get new contracts that they deserve. This is a TV-wide issue, and we are relying on the studios and streamers to end the strikes (which is admittedly) not an easy thing to do here. Following this, there are a lot of scripts that need to be written, and that is why this process overall is going to take a great deal of time. The best thing we can do is be patient. If there is any SVU news coming this month, it will almost certainly be strike related. If filming starts up in November or December, then maybe at that point we\u2019re going to have a chance to get some more news either about casting, crossovers, or whatever else the future could hold. Obviously, it goes without saying that we want to see Benson and Stabler reunite at some point \u2014 it mostly a matter of when.

When NBC announced the renewals back in the spring, SVU was originally planned to return for Season 25 in the fall (along with L&O Season 23), but OC Season 4 only received an order for 13 episodes and a midseason \u2013 a.k.a. 2024 \u2013 premiere. Now, in light of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes delaying so many TV shows, it's time for fans to reevaluate and try to find a sliver of a silver lining. While we can only speculate at this point as to when the AMPTP will agree to terms with the WGA writers and SAG-AFTRA actors to get TV and film productions moving again, I'm going to assume for argument's sake that both Law & Order: SVU and Organized Crime will be back in the new year, presumably with SVU running for fewer than the original plan for 22 episodes. Could OC and SVU both run for the same amount of episodes, and therefore actually let Mariska Hargitay's Benson and Christopher Meloni's Stabler interact on screen early in their new seasons rather than Benson go half a season seeing neither hide nor hair of her former partner? After how SVU 's Season 24 finale and OC 's Season 3 finale ended the spring with the two finally on firm footing again with\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The number of toss-up states is declining, which is an obvious trend that might have a big influence on the election\u2019s dynamics. States that are up for grabs are ones where any major party has a possibility of winning, and the election results are unpredictable. These states often become campaign focus spots, drawing a lot of attention and funding from candidates and their parties. The number of actual toss-up states has decreased recently. The polarization of American politics has made the electoral map more predictable, along with demographic changes and shifting voter preferences. Some states\u2019 political inclinations are changing as a result of population shifts. For instance, states with aging, mostly rural populations often vote Republican, whereas those with expanding urban populations typically tilt Democratic. Examining the 2024 Presidential Election Landscape Over time, some states\u2019 allegiance to one party or the other has become more steadfast. places that were formerly thought to be firmly Republican, like Texas and Georgia, have shown indications of becoming more competitive, but places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have turned into decisive states. Voters are becoming more firmly committed to their party affiliations as a result of the widening political chasm in the nation. This makes it harder for candidates to persuade unsure voters in established toss-up states. Campaigns are becoming more data-driven and focused on mobilizing their base rather than appealing to those who are still uncertain. As a result, politicians and political parties are less likely to devote resources to states that are not clearly in their favor.

The argument for disqualifying Trump comes from Section 3 of the amendment, which states that an elected official cannot assume public office if they engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or had \"given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof\" unless the official in question is granted amnesty by a two-thirds vote of Congress. Contingents in several U.S. states feel that the former president's actions during the January 6th, 2021, Capitol riot fit the bill. The discussion has gained credibility since two members of the Federalist Society, a conservative group interested in the current state of legal order, supported the concept in writings for the Pennsylvania Law Review.

But one thing is already clear: the race will almost certainly be decided by a handful of voters in the very few states not entirely secure for either party. The roster of swing states that both sides can genuinely hope to win may be as small next year as at any point in modern history \u2013 no more than seven or eight and perhaps as few as four. On such a concentrated battlefield, the margin between success and failure for the two parties may be achingly narrow and the competition for voters fiercely intense. \u201cNever have so few people had such a big impact in deciding the future of American politics,\u201d said Doug Sosnik who served as the chief White House political adviser for Bill Clinton. Multiple measures track the evolution of what could be called the incredible shrinking presidential battlefield. The most revealing is the growing number of states where either party has established a consistent advantage in the presidential race. Twenty states have voted for the Democratic nominee in each of the past four presidential elections, from Barack Obama\u2019s first win in 2008 through Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. Twenty states have likewise voted for the GOP presidential nominee in all four of those contests. That means 40 of the 50 states, or 80%, have voted the same way in four consecutive presidential elections. That\u2019s the highest level of such consistency since the turn of the 20th century. Even when Franklin D. Roosevelt won four consecutive elections from 1932 through 1944, only about two-thirds of the states voted the same way each time.\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Why this presidential campaign may feel familiar to many Americans\nbody: NEW YORK \u2014 The end of Labor Day weekend would typically mark the start of a furious sprint to the Iowa caucuses as candidates battle for their party's presidential nomination. But as the 2024 campaign comes into greater focus, the usual frenzy is yielding to a sense of inevitability. Among Republicans, Donald Trump is dominating the primary field, outpacing rivals with resumes as governors, diplomats and entrepreneurs that would normally prove compelling. The former president's strength comes despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 multiple criminal indictments that threaten to overshadow any serious debate about the future of the country. And for now, the tens of millions of dollars that Republican rivals are pouring into the race are doing little to diminish Trump's stature, fueling concerns among his GOP critics who fear the primary is essentially over before it begins. As one troubled front-runner tightens his grip on the Republican nomination, President Joe Biden is on a glide path to victory on the Democratic side. The 80-year-old incumbent is facing only token opposition for the Democratic nomination despite concerns about his age and performance from many within his own party. Whether voters like it or not, a Trump-Biden rematch may be on the horizon, raising the prospect of a deeply uncertain election season that only intensifies the nation's political divide. Already, Trump is skipping his party's presidential debates and his court appearances are sometimes drawing more attention than his campaign stops. And Biden has barely begun to campaign as he grapples with questions about his age and his son's legal challenges. \"I just can't imagine things markedly changing.

If this seems like a long time to contemplate the candidates, it is. By comparison , Canadian election campaigns average just 50 days. In France, candidates have just two weeks to campaign, while Japanese law restricts campaigns to a meager 12 days. Those countries all give more power than the United States does to the legislative branch, which might explain the limited attention to the selection of the chief executive. But Mexico \u2013 which, like the US, has a presidential system \u2013 only allows 90 days for its presidential campaigns, with a 60-day \u201cpre-season,\u201d the equivalent of the US nomination campaign.

As a political scientist living in Iowa , I\u2019m acutely aware of how long the modern American presidential campaign has become. It wasn\u2019t always this way.

It originated out of widespread frustration with the control that national parties used to wield over the selection of candidates. But changes to election procedures, along with media coverage that started to depict the election as a horse race, have also contributed to the trend .

Earlier this year, we all developed a new obsession when Netflix released it's three-part crime series, Murdaugh Murders, following the fascinating Alex Murdaugh trial practically in real time \u2014 Alex Murdaugh was found guilty of murdering his wife and son only weeks after the series dropped and sentenced to life in prison. However, as the first season revealed, the Murdaugh family had a history of suspicious goings-on that spanned back almost a decade. As anyone who caught the first season of Murdaugh Murders on Netflix knows, the first three episodes barely scratched the surface \u2014 in fact, we were left with more questions about the Murdaugh family and their alleged crimes than we had when it began. Now, Netflix is bringing the hit series back for another three-part season, delving even deeper into the sprawling Murdaugh case. As co-directors and co\u2013executive producers Julia Willoughby Nason and Michael Gasparro told Vanity Fair, they had always hoped to make a further three episodes. \u201cWe always envisioned this as six episodes, and it was really just about getting Netflix on board.

Editor\u2019s note: Today\u2019s impeachment proceedings have ended and this post will no longer be updated. You can find new articles reporting the latest from Ken Paxton\u2019s trial here. The historic impeachment trial of suspended Attorney General Ken Paxton is underway. He faces 16 articles of impeachment that accuse him of bribery, dereliction of duty and disregard of official duty. Paxton has faced criminal investigations, legal battles and accusations of wrongdoing for years. Still, Texas voters have twice reelected him, most recently in November. Paxton has long positioned himself as one of the country\u2019s strongest conservative attorneys general. In more than two terms as the state\u2019s top lawyer, he has relentlessly sued the federal government over issues from immigration to health care and the environment. Paxton's attorneys argue that the impeachment allegations are baseless or fall under the legitimate duties of the attorney general\u2019s office. The trial is expected to hinge on Paxton\u2019s relationship with a real estate investor and political donor \u2014 and could prominently feature details of an alleged extramarital affair. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick will act as judge. Witnesses will testify under oath, senator-jurors will deliberate privately and votes will be conducted without public debate. The attorney general\u2019s wife, Sen. Angela Paxton, will sit as part of the court, but will not vote or deliberate. Paxton loyalists, but few others, turn out Compared to Ken Paxton\u2019s Impeachment in the House in May, the first day of the Senate trial drew a smaller crowd \u2014 a majority of which included supporters of the now suspended attorney general to show solidarity at the Capitol.

Nearly three years later, the eyes of the nation will be on the Texas Senate on Tuesday as the state's most deliberative body begins examining whether Paxton, one of the most powerful elected officials in the state \u2014 and an ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump's false claims of winning the 2020 presidential election \u2014 should be removed from office. Support from two-thirds of the Senate, or 21 of the participating 30 Senate-jurors, will be required to remove Paxton from office on any one of the 16 articles of impeachment he faces. Ken Paxton impeachment trial live update Follow for the latest The Texas House on May 27 overwhelmingly voted to impeach Paxton, who was immediately suspended from office without pay, after investigators in the lower chamber launched a probe looking into possible transgressions by the state's top lawyer. And though the accusations are not new, it seems House members during the legislative session in the spring took umbrage with being asked by Paxton to have the state cover a $3.3 million settlement with four of the attorney general's former aides who sued the office after they say they were fired for raising their concerns about Paxton with federal authorities. Paxton's defense team has cast the proceeding as a witch hunt, and his supporters are pushing to keep him in office. Defend Texas Liberty PAC, a pro-Paxton political action committee, in June gave $3 million \u2014 a $1 million donation and a $2 million loan \u2014 to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who will preside like a judge over the impeachment trial.

The far-right Texas Republican machine has swung into action to protect Paxton at all costs. Paxton is only the third state official to ever be impeached in Texas. He was overwhelmingly impeached by the Texas House on charges of abuse of office related to wealthy donor Nate Paul and other related crimes. Paxton, who has never been that friendly with the Texas legislature, has framed the impeachment as a politically motivated witch hunt led by Speaker Dade Phelan. The legal woes of the attorney general are legion. On top of his impeachment, he is finally looking at a court date for the indictment for securities fraud he was handed eight years ago, and the federal government is also looking into his finances. Despite all this, Paxton easily won re-election in 2022. Bribes Because the trial is taking place in the Texas Senate, Texas Senators and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick will be the jury and judge. As the trial starts after the moratorium on political contributions has ended, Interested parties are all legally able to drop money in the campaign accounts of politicians. The money is already rolling in. Patrick received $3 million from the Defend Texas Liberty, bankrolled by long-time Paxton supporters like oil and gas moguls Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks. The PAC has made it very clear that they expect to use their money to move the needle. \u201c\u201dDefend Texas Liberty will ensure that every Republican voter in Texas knows just what a sham the Texas House has been this session and just how absurd this last minute Democrat led impeachment effort is,\u201d the group tweeted in May. Threats Which leads to the threats portion of the discussion. Texas Republicans do not generally have to worry about Democratic challengers.

Why it matters: Regardless of the outcome, the trial will be historic. Paxton is the third state official in Texas history to be impeached, following Gov. James \"Pa\" Ferguson in 1917 and a district judge in 1975. The latest: Paxton's trial is scheduled to start at 9am Tuesday and will be livestreamed by several news outlets, including WFAA and the Dallas Morning News. State of play: The Republican-dominated Texas House voted 121-23 to impeach Paxton on May 27, days before the end of this year's regular legislative session. Votes from two-thirds of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 19-12 majority, will be needed to permanently remove Paxton from office. If he's convicted, senators can also vote to bar him from holding elected office in Texas again. The allegations: Senators will weigh whether Paxton illegally used his office to benefit an Austin real estate developer and improperly fired some of the top deputies who reported him to the FBI and other agencies. The trial will cover 16 of the 20 articles of impeachment against him, which include bribery, obstruction of justice and abuse of public trust. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing. The big picture: The FBI is also investigating Paxton for the alleged misdeeds underpinning his impeachment. A grand jury has reportedly been impaneled to review potential criminal charges. Paxton also faces eight-year-old fraud charges, a whistleblower lawsuit, and a state bar lawsuit over his role in challenging the 2020 election results that could end with his disbarment. Between the lines: State Sen. Angela Paxton, Ken Paxton's wife, is barred from serving as a juror, per rules the Senate adopted in June.

Money for the program would continue so long as Congress keeps the government funded \u2014 an increasingly uncertain prospect as members with competing demands begin returning this week. But lawmakers in both parties see no clear path for reviving the law by the end of the year. While the program would limp on, the impasse threatens to turn an initiative credited with saving 25 million lives into an annual political battle, making it far more difficult for groups fighting HIV and AIDS to hire staff or launch long-term projects. \u201cFor 20 years, we\u2019ve passed clean reauthorizations on a bipartisan basis to keep this program running, and this September we\u2019re at risk of it lapsing,\u201d said Rep.

Convening on June 28 and 29, 2023, in Phoenix, Arizona, the Council engaged with several panels and participated in site visits prior to the meeting. Many presenters were members of American Indian communities, others represented organizations serving those communities. To open the meeting, Barnaby Lewis, (Gila River), Tribal Elder, welcomed PACHA to his community and provided a blessing. The first panel began with a presentation by PACHA member Laura Platero, JD, (Navajo), Executive Director of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board. She discussed key principles of the federal-Indian trust relationship, tribal sovereignty, and the federal responsibilities for health care. Rick Haverkate, MPH, (Sault Ste.

COVID-19 has largely been absorbed into school districts' general guidance for respiratory illness for students and staff. Here's what to know. What is the current state of COVID-19 in Maricopa County? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using weekly hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19 as the primary indicators of transmission. In Maricopa County, there has recently been a slight uptick in the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions, which is in line with the national trend, said Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. According to the most recent CDC tracking data , hospital admissions in Maricopa County for the week of July 30 through Aug. 5 were up 19.3 percent from the prior week. Nationally, the change in COVID-19 hospital admissions for that same time period was 14.3 percent. Despite the upward trend, the level of COVID-19 hospital admissions in the county is classified as low by the CDC, meaning there are fewer than 10 admissions per 100,000 people. There were 105 COVID-19 hospital admissions in Maricopa County total that week, according to CDC data. The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is also seeing a slight increase in the number of cases being reported, which is likely due to the new, fast-spreading strain of COVID-19, EG.5, nicknamed \"Eris\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Arizona superintendent Tom Horne to use COVID relief for $40 million tutoring program\nbody: PHOENIX - Arizona is channeling $40 million in federal COVID-19 relief funding toward tutoring students falling behind in school, the state superintendent said Tuesday. Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne announced at a news conference that free tutoring will be available for students who failed to pass proficiency tests in reading, writing and math. The tutoring program, however, will be given on a first-come, first-serve basis. Only students between first and eighth grade at public and charter schools will be eligible. Parents can request it through the state Department of Education website. \"I have one obsession in life. My obsession is that we increase the proficiency levels of the students in the schools and that we help the teachers achieve that,\" Horne said. The funding will cover over one million hours of tutoring for four days a week over a six-week period. Either a certified teacher or a private vendor approved by the state would do the tutoring, according to Horne. Teachers will be paid $30 per hour. If they make sufficient progress in that six-week window, they will get an additional $200 stipend. A teacher who can find the time to tutor could potentially make $8,000 overall. \"This will help the teachers improve their income,\" Horne said. A spokesperson for the Arizona Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers union, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. The federal government earmarked $2.7 billion to Arizona to assist with pandemic-driven learning loss. Roughly 90% of that money went to districts around the state. That left $130 million for the Arizona Department of Education.

The release of this update comes after Senator McConnell appeared to freeze in front of cameras for the second time in as many months, raising questions about his condition and ability to continue leading the Senate Republican Conference. The note, provided by Brian Monahan, the Capitol Hill attending physician, offers insight into Senator McConnell's health condition, emphasizing that there is no evidence of a stroke, seizure disorder, or movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease. This information is reassuring to many who were worried about the senator's health following his recent public episodes. Previously, Senator McConnell's office had attributed these two instances of freezing to \"lightheadedness. Dr. Monahan's note elaborates on this by indicating that it is \"not uncommon\" for individuals recovering from a concussion to experience lightheadedness. It's worth noting that Senator McConnell suffered a concussion and broken ribs in March after a fall at a Washington hotel, which resulted in him hitting his head. This incident had sidelined him from Senate activities for nearly six weeks, and his recent episodes raised concerns about the lingering effects of that injury. The release of this health update couldn't have come at a more crucial time, as the Senate resumed its session following a five-week recess. During this period, speculation and questions arose among GOP senators about whether Senator McConnell could continue leading the Republican Conference effectively. His tenure of 16 years as a party leader in the Senate marks a significant milestone in the chamber's history, making his health a matter of heightened interest and concern. Senator McConnell, despite the uncertainties surrounding his health, is determined to fulfill his leadership responsibilities. He is expected to address Senate business during floor remarks scheduled after the chamber's opening at 3 p.m. ET. Additionally, he plans to convene with his leadership team at 5 p.m., marking the first meeting of its kind since the summer break. The health of a Senate leader is always a matter of national importance, and in Senator McConnell's case, his extended tenure as the Republican leader has made him a central figure in American politics. The recent health update offers some reassurance, but it also underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and support to ensure that he can continue his role effectively. As the Senate reconvenes, the nation will be watching closely to see how Senator McConnell manages both his health and the political challenges that lie ahead.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s office releases new health update after second frozen moment\nbody: WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's health episodes show \"no evidence\" of being a stroke or seizure disorder, the Capitol physician said in a letter on Tuesday, offering little further explanation for the apparent freeze-ups that have drawn concerns about the 81-year-old's situation. McConnell's office released the letter from attending physician Brian P. Monahan as the Senate returns from an extended summer break and questions mount over the long-serving Republican leader's health. The GOP leader froze up last week during a press conference in Kentucky, unable to respond to a question, the second such episode in a month. \"There is no evidence that you have a seizure disorder or that you experienced a stroke, TIA or movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease,\" Monahan wrote, using the acronym for a transient ischemic attack, a brief stroke. The doctor said the assessments entailed several medical evaluations including a brain MRI imaging and \"consultations with several neurologists for a comprehensive neurology assessment.\" The evaluations come after McConnell fell and suffered a concussion earlier this year. \"There are no changes recommended in treatment protocols as you continue recovery from your March 2023 fall,\" the doctor said. After last week's freeze-up, the attending physician to Congress cleared McConnell to continue with his planned schedule. McConnell arrived Tuesday at the Capitol office. But the episodes have fueled quiet concern among Republican senators and intense speculation in Washington about McConnell's ability to remain as leader. The long-serving senator fell and hit his head at a political dinner this year, suffering the concussion. It all comes amid a swirl of health concerns in Washington, particularly as COVID-19 cases show signs of rising heading into fall. First lady Jill Biden tested positive for COVID-19 over the weekend, but President Joe Biden tested negative. Nevertheless, many Republican allies have flocked to McConnell's side, ensuring the famously guarded leader a well of support. Rivals have muted any calls for a direct challenge to McConnell's leadership. McConnell is expected to address the Senate as it opens for a flurry of fall activity, most notably the need for Congress to approve funding to prevent any interruption in federal operations by Sept. 30, which is the end of the fiscal year. Some House Republicans are willing to shut down the government at the end of the month if they are unable to enact steep spending restrictions they are fighting for that go beyond the agreement Biden reached with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this summer. In leading Senate Republicans, McConnell is viewed by the White House and Democrats as a potentially more pragmatic broker who is more interested in avoiding a messy government shutdown that could be politically damaging to the GOP. McConnell has also made it a priority to ensure Ukraine continues to receive support from the U\n3. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Mitch McConnell's Health Cleared by Doctors Following Public Pausing Episodes\nbody: video by @10TampaBay Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader, is medically cleared to resume his duties. He had previously experienced some unexplained pauses during public expressions. His doctor, Brian P. Monahan, affirmed that these incidents were not a sign of severe conditions such as Parkinson's disease or stroke. There were earlier significant worries about McConnell's health, but he has now returned to his duties at the Capitol. Multiple medical consultations and tests like an MRI confirmed McConnell's health status, allowing him to continue with his duties. McConnell dismissed prior worries about his health as stress-related due to a busy schedule. He didn't participate in debates about his health incidents. When asked about it, McConnell only responded with a smile. His occasional health incidents have started conversations about the capacity of older lawmakers to lead. While supporters of McConnell argue that he is 'sharp' and fully able to perform his duties, others suggest considering younger leaders.

Outlaw, who made history as the first Black woman to lead Philadelphia's police force, is embarking on a new journey as the Deputy Chief Security Officer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Her departure is slated for September 22, with First Deputy Commissioner John M. Stanford, Jr. stepping in as Interim Police Commissioner. Outlaw's announcement comes after a period of significant challenges and changes in the city's landscape. She assumed her role in February 2020, taking on the immense responsibility of overseeing a department grappling with historic protests in the wake of George Floyd's killing and subsequent allegations of excessive force. This tumultuous period led to a substantial settlement payout of over $9 million to those affected by the police department's response. In recent times, the Philadelphia Police Department faced scrutiny for its handling of high-profile cases, including the police shooting of Eddie Jose Irizarry and a misdirected response prior to a mass shooting in the Kingsessing neighborhood. These incidents, coupled with a surge in carjackings and gun crimes, placed additional pressure on Outlaw's leadership. Despite these challenges, Outlaw's time as commissioner was marked by a commitment to reform, a dedication Mayor Jim Kenney acknowledged in his statement. Outlaw herself commended the hard work and professionalism of her department, emphasizing their adaptability and resilience in the face of adversity. While Outlaw's departure comes at a pivotal moment, with a new mayoral administration on the horizon, it signifies the end of an era for Philadelphia's police force. As the city navigates this transition, it remains to be seen who will be chosen to lead the department and steer its future course.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Commissioner Outlaw Announces Departure from Philadelphia Police Department\nbody: Philadelphia, PA - Today, Police Commissioner Danielle M. Outlaw announced her departure from the Philadelphia Police Department to accept a new leadership position with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as Deputy Chief Security Officer. Her last day as Police Commissioner will be September 22, 2023. Mayor Kenney has appointed First Deputy John M. Stanford, Jr. as Interim Police Commissioner upon her departure. In her statement, Commissioner Outlaw expressed appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the department's officers, noting their resilience in the face of adversity and their success in achieving milestones under her leadership. She highlighted their efforts in meeting the goals of the Crime Prevention and Violence Reduction Action Plan that was developed and shared with the public within three months of her appointment, including crime reduction, improved clearance rates, reduced complaints against police, and increased diversity in hiring and promotions. Commissioner Outlaw concluded by expressing gratitude for everyone's service to all: \"It has been my honor and privilege to serve alongside each of you as the leader of the Philadelphia Police Department...Together, we have proven that we are unbreakable, as we have endured the most challenging times in the chronicles of policing.\" Mayor Kenney thanked Commissioner Outlaw for her service: \"Danielle has been an exemplary leader during an unprecedented period for our city...Her unwavering commitment to justice reform and community engagement will continue to impact Philadelphia long after she departs office.\"\n3. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Philadelphia police commissioner resigns after turbulent three years\nbody: Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw will step down this month to help lead a New York-area transit system, the mayor said Tuesday, ending a turbulent three years in which she guided one of the country\u2019s largest police forces through pandemic lockdowns, Black Lives Matter protests and frequent turmoil over race and policing. Outlaw, the first Black woman to run the 6,000-member department, came aboard just before the pandemic shutdown and quickly had to oversee the city's safety as intense protests broke out in Philadelphia and across the country in the summer of 2020 over the police killing of Black people. Her resignation comes just a few months before the end of Mayor Jim Kenney\u2019s tenure and as the rates of homicides and other crimes have become a major issue in the race to replace him. She will soon start a top security position with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Tensions between Philadelphia police and the public escalated after George Floyd\u2019s killing in May 2020, when mostly peaceful protesters who shut down a major city expressway were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. The City Council issued a statement calling the police response \u201cbrutal,\u201d \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cunacceptable,\u201d but Outlaw initially defended the strategy. The city later paid a $9.25-million settlement to hundreds of protesters. Later that year, police came under rebuke again when a young Black man named Walter Wallace Jr., who had a history of mental illness and was brandishing a knife outside his home, was shot and killed within seconds of police arriving to the scene. Outlaw bemoaned the lack of mental health services while pledging the department would do better. And they came to a head again just last month, when the department had to backtrack to say that a man who was killed by an officer who had stopped him for erratic driving had neither lunged at police with a knife nor exited the car, as police officials initially claimed. Outlaw moved to fire the officer for insubordination and other alleged policy violations in the Aug. 14 death of Eddie Irizarry. \u201cCommissioner Outlaw has worked relentlessly for three and a half years during an unprecedented era in our city and a number of crisis situations, and she deserves praise for her commitment to bring long-overdue reform to the Department after years of racism and gender discrimination prior to her appointment,\u201d Kenney said in a statement. He has named First Deputy John M. Stanford Jr. as interim police commissioner. While campaigning, Democratic mayoral candidate Cherelle Parker has skirted questions over her plans for leadership at the Police Department. Over the last few years, Philadelphia has seen a sharp increase in homicides, setting a modern-day record in 2021 with 562 homicides that year. Homicides declined slightly in 2022, and advocates have said they are on track to decrease further this year.

Full disclaimer - I do not model for NFL player props nor have any long-term history in betting NFL player props. The picks shared here are not what I personally derived but simply came about by assuming market efficiency and finding off-market value. I will also not direct you to the specific books that have these as I feel like that will lead to a conflict of interest as many places that direct you to places to bet are not doing so as player advocates but rather to claim affiliate fees. I have nothing personally against affiliate fees, I've put them in my articles in the past, but I don't think it's okay for me to put them in a link to make a wager and I know if I were posting where to bet what then I'd be highly incentivized to do that. Not saying where also helps ensure people don't bet it blindly but rather line shop - which is essential if you ever want to have any chance of being a profitable sports bettor. What I can promise is that at the time of writing this article, the lines that I highlighted do indeed exist in the real world and they are going to be profitable to bet over the long term. However, we're usually talking about single-digit expected ROI - which is basically like flipping a coin 100 times and expecting to win 52-56 of the flips. This means we're going to lose quite often and profits will be a trickle over the course of a season and it's very possible we hit the wrong side of variance and have a losing year on these. You should be line-shopping for these plays, and most importantly, if the value is gone then don't bet it. For example, if I write that I like o80.5 -115 and you can only find -125 then don't bet it. Likewise, if you find -115 everywhere then clearly the market has shifted since I wrote the article and that wager no longer represents value but rather consensus, so again do not bet. I can't emphasize enough, with the razor-thin edges we're working with, not betting is a far stronger option than betting on something that is not ideal. There are thousands of offerings to bet upon each day. No need for FOMO, we'll find more value in the future. About me, I've made the majority of my income from DFS and sports betting since 2016. I will be tracking these plays for full transparency. My own outs are limited as I'm restricted to Pay Per Head (PPH) and offshores, so a lot of these I won't bet on myself simply because I don't have access to the places where the lines are good. Which again I think needs to be emphasized.

They went 3-0 in group play, with their most recent victory coming over Jordan, 110-62. With their undefeated record in group play, Team USA now moves on to the second round. Many fans have wondered if the American team would have as much success as usual at the FIBA World Cup. Team USA has won five FIBA World Cup titles (tied for the most ever), but the 2023 didn\u2019t have as much star NBA talent as usual. Still, the Americans have dominated their opponents so far, seemingly proving doubters wrong. So, who are the players on Team USA that are putting up these big games? Here is Team USA\u2019s roster in the FIBA World Cup. All FIBA World Cup statistics are from the FIBA website. Paolo Banchero, PF, Orlando Magic The 2023 rookie of the year, Paolo Banchero, is showing that his scoring ability translates to international play. In three FIBA World Cup games, he has averaged 12.3 points and 3.7 rebounds. Banchero was the number one overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft because of his scoring prowess. He can score at all three levels but thrives in the mid-range as an isolation scorer or down low because of his incredible strength and ability to punish smaller defenders. Mikal Bridges, SF, Brooklyn Nets A starter for Team USA, Bridges was known more as a super-role player in his first few years with the Phoenix Suns. He is lanky, plays stifling defense, and hits open three-pointers. It wasn\u2019t until he was traded to the Nets that the forward showed he had even more in his game. He averaged 26.1 points per game after the trade last season after showcasing more self-creation and isolation ability. Through three games in the FIBA World Cup, Bridges has 8.3 points per game. Jalen Brunson, PG, New York Knicks Jalen Brunson and Mikal Bridges won two NCAA championships together at Villanova in college; now, they are both starters on Team USA\n2. publish date: 2023-09-04, Monday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: FIBA Basketball World Cup bracket 2023: Group play, knockout rounds & championship game dates\nbody: The 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup kicked off on Friday, Aug. 25 with the first round of the group stage.

Three of the four nations have been to the semifinal stage of the World Cup before. Canada is making its first-ever final four appearance. The two North American and European sides locked up qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics with their semifinal berths, so all they have to worry about now is winning the tournament. The top two finishers from Europe and North American automatically qualified for Paris. The Americans opened as a double-digit favorite against Germany, but the European side could be a tougher opponent than the odds suggest. Strong defensive play has been a staple for Germany and Serbia throughout the tournament, and that could produce two tight semifinals in the Philippines on Friday.

Serbia vs. Canada (4:45 a.m. ET, ESPN+) United States (-10.5) vs. Germany (8:30 a.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN+) Predictions against the spread in bold. United States vs. Germany 2 of 3 The United States already produced a better finish than the disastrous 2019 World Cup. Anthony Edwards, Austin Reaves and Co. returned the United States to their normal position in the final four of the World Cup with a 37-point win over Italy on Tuesday. Germany stands in the way of the Americans and the final. The European side will difficult to play against with Dennis Schroder running the show. Germany is one win away from confirming its best-ever World Cup finish. Its current best mark is third place from 2002. Schroder and Franz Wagner are Germany's biggest scoring threats, and that is actually good news for the Americans, who have plenty of guards and wings to defend on the roster. The United States' biggest weakness is in the paint, but Germany does not have an overwhelming paint presence, like Lithuania had with Jonas Valanciunas.

With an estimated 140,000 attendees and 278 vibrant booths at the Los Angeles Convention Center complex over three unforgettable days, this year\u2019s KCON LA was a true spectacle. From meet-and-greets and mesmerizing workshops to delectable food, a dazzling red carpet, captivating dance showcases and extraordinary live performances, the event had it all. In its 11th year, KCON LA extended its festivities to three action-packed days instead of the usual two. While artists like Stray Kids, ATEEZ, Rain, NCT\u2019s Taeyong, SHINee\u2019s Taemin and SM\u2019s newest sensation, RIIZE, set the Crypto.com Arena ablaze with their showmanship, it was the girl groups who added a charming magic to the mix. Here are eight outstanding girl group moments from KCON LA 2023, because when these ladies took the stage, they devoured the spotlight and left no crumbs behind. 8. Lapillus x EVERGLOW KCON's magnetic allure lies in its ability to seamlessly amalgamate an array of diverse talents onto one electrifying stage. As the curtains rose on the third night's concert, the convergence of MLD Entertainment's beguiling girl group, Lapillus, and Yuehua Entertainment's darling EVERGLOW was a jolting surprise.

Their former leader Enrique Tarrio received the longest of them all, 22 years. He prepared the assault over a number of weeks and then orchestrated and encouraged the violence on the day, the court heard. Several other members have also been sent to jail for many years. But how did a group that started as a drinking club seven years ago become one of the main organised groups at the Capitol riot? And in what form will they continue now some of their leaders are behind bars? What next for the group? Shortly before several members were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the Capitol riot, the group's founder Gavin McInnes told the BBC that long prison sentences will make the make the group's leaders into \"martyrs for the cause\", and insisted the group will continue despite its current lack of leadership. \"It's just set in stone and you can't kill it. There's no top, there's no head,\" he said. The defendants \"did something wrong\" by entering the Capitol, but said he believes their actions amounted to relatively minor offences. Unlike some of the other organised groups involved in the Capitol riot which have since ceased operations, local Proud Boy chapters continue to remain active across the country. Expert observers largely agree that the Proud Boys will continue and may even prosper. Samantha Kutner, a researcher who's written about the group and is co-founder of Glitterpill LLC, an anti-extremism consultancy group, says that given the increasing politicisation after the Capitol riots, the convictions may give the Proud Boys a boost. \"It will give them more momentum,\" she says. \"Every time they lose it furthers their martyrdom and persecution complex.\" In an audio interview on Twitter which Tarrio joined via phone from his jail cell just after arguments ended in the court case, the former Proud Boys leader accused authorities of \"weaponising\" the justice system and likened the current US government to the regime in Nazi Germany. \"This is not the end of the Proud Boys,\"\n4. publish date: 2023-09-07, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: A River\u2019s Destiny: The battle for wild and scenic status\nbody: Part One By Jack Igelman, Carolina Public Press August 21, 2023 \u201cA River\u2019s Destiny\u201d is a two-part investigative project reported by Jack Igelman. The project tells the history of the North Fork, how conservationists have long advocated for its special federal protection, and the process to achieve wild and scenic status for its preservation. This is part one of the investigation. As it winds its way through rugged landscapes, diverse ecosystems, and cherished recreational areas, the French Broad River in Western North Carolina is believed to be one of the oldest rivers in the world. Paddlers, conservationists, and other river enthusiasts have long advocated for special federal protection for one of its most beloved tributaries in Transylvania County. But achieving the coveted designation for the North Fork of the French Broad and similar rivers is like navigating a challenging whitewater stream. It involves skillfully maneuvering through government bureaucracy, adding years of study and review to the designation process. This complex and prolonged process requires support from local government, legislation enacted by Congress and the president\u2019s signature. Harrison Metzger of Mills River in Henderson County is perhaps one of the North Fork\u2019s fiercest advocates and is supporting the effort in neighboring Transylvania County to gain federal protection for this whitewater paddling destination within Pisgah National Forest. Not only has he paddled the river dozens of times, but as a local journalist in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the Hendersonville Times-News , he reported on the thwarted effort to dam the North Fork and five other tributaries of the French Broad River. Metzger calls the North Fork a \u201chidden treasure\u201d and views it as a highly accessible creek run in Western North Carolina, treasured for its tight and steep features by whitewater boaters, especially during and after heavy rainfall. Supporters like Metzger have helped generate enthusiasm and support for federal wild and scenic status to preserve the North Fork\u2019s natural state. Yet others are concerned about additional federal protections they see as unnecessary and intrusive.

The record-breaking forward went on to participate in her fourth and final World Cup with the US women's national team in July and August, and will now finish the second half of the NWSL campaign to end her career. \"I've been able to have such an incredible career, and this game has brought me all over the world and allowed me to meet so many amazing people. I feel incredibly grateful to have played as long as I have, to be as successful as we've been, and to have been a part of a generation of players who undoubtedly left the game better than they found it. To be able to play one last World Cup and one last NWSL season and go out on my own terms is incredibly special,\" said Rapinoe at the time of her announcement. \"I want to thank my family for being by my side all these years.

Her career ended with a last-16 exit at the Women's World Cup and she says some had been \"waiting for this stumble\". Rapinoe also criticised the \"misogyny and sexism\" shown by Spanish football federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales during their win in the final. \"It made me think about how much we are required to endure,\" said Rapinoe. Spain's 1-0 win over England in Sydney was overshadowed by Rubiales kissing forward Jenni Hermoso on the lips during the presentation ceremony. That came after Rubiales grabbed his crotch as he celebrated victory at the final whistle in the VIP area of Stadium Australia, near Queen Letizia of Spain and her 16-year-old daughter. Spain coach Jorge Vilda survived a player revolt last September, when the RFEF said that 15 players had submitted identical emails saying they would not play for him unless \"significant\" concerns over their \"emotional state\" and \"health\" were addressed. However, the the RFEF continued to back Vilda and posted 'VILDA IN' on Spain's official X account after their World Cup triumph.

The Ballon d\u2019Or is presented annually by French news magazine France Football to one men\u2019s and one women\u2019s soccer player deemed to have the best performance over the previous year. This includes players from clubs around the globe. Previous winners include Alexia Putellas and Megan Rapinoe on the women\u2019s side, and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo on the men\u2019s. Smith, 23, won NWSL MVP last season with 15 goals and three assists in 20 appearances (18 starts) for the Thorns, who won the 2022 NWSL championship thanks in part to an early Smith goal that featured her now-iconic shrug celebration.

Despite the large crowds attending the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, the Electric Zoo music festival and West Indian Day Parade, major crime was down 9% last weekend compared to the same period last year, Mayor Eric Adams said. \u201cThe approach was clear: How do we celebrate without allowing people to be harmed by those who want to bring violence in this city?\u201d Adams said. The mayor continued, \"Not only was this past weekend a historic success, one most recent crime stat shows that we are making significant progress on lowering crime overall.\" There were four shooting incidents in Brooklyn last weekend, according to NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, a dramatic decrease from nine homicides and 29 shooting victims in 2021. The NYPD announced last week that it would use drones to monitor Labor Day festivities, sending images to a control operations unit at police headquarters. The data helped field commanders determine how many officers to send to a scene, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said. The technology came in handy last weekend when more than 88,000 people crammed into the Electric Zoo festival venue on Randall\u2019s Island. The two-day event hit dangerous levels of overcapacity due to thousands of fake ticket and wristband sales, according to Chell. Chell said police used drones to respond quickly to 911 calls about overcrowding, leaving this year\u2019s Electric Zoo festival safer than last with 41% fewer crimes and 175% more arrests. \u201cIt would have been impossible to get a full scope on the size of the crowd if we didn\u2019t have the technology to do so,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt costs $1,700 to fill up a helicopter that is used in situations like this.

The special enforcement period starts on Friday, September 1, 2023, and runs through Monday, September 4, 2023. Labor Day weekend traditionally results in heavy traffic throughout the state. This increased flow of traffic also brings with it an increase in accidents, serious injuries, and fatalities and police will be out in force to remove impaired and reckless drivers from our highways. New York State Police Acting Superintendent Steven A. Nigrelli said, \u201cTraffic safety is a top priority, and each day Troopers work to ensure the well-being of all those who utilize New York\u2019s roadways. Our goal during this enforcement is to ensure we can take intoxicated and drug impaired drivers off our roadways before they injure or kill others. Our Troopers will remain vigilant to remove reckless drivers from our roads and hold them accountable for their actions. I thank the Governor\u2019s Traffic Safety Committee for their support in conducting pivotal traffic enforcements such as this.\u201d Drivers can expect to see sobriety checkpoints and increased patrols by State Police and local law enforcement agencies during this holiday weekend. Troopers will be using both marked State Police vehicles and Concealed Identity Traffic Enforcement (CITE) vehicles as part of this crackdown to more easily identify motorists who are violating the law. CITE vehicles allow the Trooper to better observe driving violations. These vehicles blend in with everyday traffic but are unmistakable as emergency vehicles once the emergency lighting is activated. This initiative is partially funded by the Governor\u2019s Traffic Safety Committee (GTSC). The GTSC and the New York State STOP-DWI Foundation remind motorists that their \u201cHave a Plan\u201d mobile app is available for Apple, Droid and Windows smartphones. The app enables New Yorkers to locate and call a taxi service and program a designated driver list. It also provides information on DWI laws and penalties, and a way to even report a suspected impaired driver. On Labor Day weekend in 2022, Troopers arrested 191 people for DWI, issued 9,580 total tickets, and investigated 140 crashes, which resulted in three fatalities.\n3. publish date: 2023-09-01, Friday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: NYPD using surveillance drones to monitor Labor Day parties\nbody: Labor Day celebrations are sure to be underway in New York City this weekend, but now people have more than just burnt hot dogs and intoxicated friends to worry about: Police surveillance drones crashing the party. The New York City Police department announced that it plans to use unmanned aircraft to respond to noise complaints and large gatherings, including private events, over the holiday weekend. \"If a caller states there\u2019s a large crowd, a large party in a backyard, we\u2019re going to be utilizing our assets to go up and go check on the party to make sure if the call is founded or not,\" assistant NYPD Commissioner Kaz Daughtry said at a live press conference Thursday. However, the department mentioned that Labor Day won't be the only event being celebrated this weekend. Police will also be focused on J\u2019Ouvert, an annual Caribbean festival that marks the end of slavery and draws thousands of revelers to the city. However, as the Associated Press reported, the drone plan raises some serious concerns about privacy and whether it violates existing police surveillance laws. New York City's POST Act requires police to share any plans on new surveillance technology at least 90 days prior, allowing the public time to comment. But in this instance, the department has not done so. While the NYPD did publish a document in 2021 listing ways it plans to use drones for surveillance and responding to crime scenes, it didn't mention anything related to nosy neighbors complaining about backyard parties. Like many cities, New York has increasingly relied on drones for surveillance and policing purposes. According to a recent report from the American Civil Liberties Union, some 1,400 police departments across the country are currently using drones at some capacity. \"American police departments have begun making the case that they should be permitted to fly drones broadly across cities and towns for purposes such as responding to emergencies, but they are already being used far more broadly than many realize, and their use is likely to broaden even more,\" said Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. \"We recommend that communities put in place statutory guardrails to ensure that drone use does not overspill reasonable limits, and that they do not initiate DFR (Drone as First Responder) programs until we have a better sense of how this technology is playing out in the real world.\"\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

His sentence is the longest for any defendant tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and was widely reported by news outlets, including ABC News and NBC News. \u201cTo the men and women of law enforcement who answered the call that day, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tarrio said in a statement before his sentencing. \u201cI have always tried to hold myself to a higher standard and I failed. I failed miserably. I thought of myself morally above others and this trial has humbled me.\u201d Tarrio downplayed that the riot was intended to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cI am not a political zealot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I get back home, I want nothing to do with politics, groups, activism or rallies.\u201d Tarrio\u2019s attorney Sabino Jauregui had told the court that his client \u201cis no terrorist\u201d and branded him a \u201cmisguided patriot\u201d who was trying to protect his country. Prosecutors had asked for a 33-year sentence for the 39-year-old Tarrio. He was one of four Proud Boys found guilty of seditious conspiracy, a serious crime of conspiring against the United States. U.S. District Judge Tim Kelly approved a sentencing enhancement for terrorism but still set the sentencing well below what he could have imposed. Tarrio wasn\u2019t physically present when members of the hate group and other followers of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol because he had been arrested days earlier for vandalism at a church and was forbidden to travel to D.C. However, prosecutors argued that Tarrio was in command of the violent group and took credit for the riot on behalf of the Proud Boys.

His conviction is linked to his leading role in the conspiracy surrounding the attack on the Capitol on January 6th. Despite not being physically present due to an unrelated arrest, the prosecution successfully argued that Tarrio coordinated the attack remotely from a hotel in Baltimore. His involvement in recruiting Proud Boys members and encouraging the assault is the core of the case against him. Other members of the group, including key lieutenants, have been sentenced to between 10 and 18 years for their roles in the riot. Despite arguments on moral grounds from his defense, Tarrio's actions were classified as 'terrorism'. This increased the potential sentence under federal guidelines, although the final term was left to the judge's discretion.

This despite the fact that Tarrio was not at the Capitol on that day. He was monitoring events from a hotel room in Baltimore. NPR's domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef reports. ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Tarrio expressed regret for his role just before receiving the sentence. He acknowledged that former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, but he still received the longest sentence of anyone who's been charged in connection to January 6. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said that even though Tarrio was physically in another location that day, he was unmistakably the leader behind the Proud Boys' violent activities at the Capitol. The sentencing marks quite a downfall for Tarrio. It was during his time as national chairman that the Proud Boys brand was launched quite suddenly into the American consciousness. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. YOUSEF: That was during the first presidential debate in 2020, when former President Donald Trump declined to disavow the street violence that the Proud Boys sought. After that, the far-right group became a mainstay at pro-Trump Stop the Steal rallies. The government's case took down Tarrio and his top lieutenants. It pinned seditious conspiracy charges against four of them. But it has not quelled a growing movement on the right that initially rallied around false claims of a stolen election. Cassie Miller is with the Southern Poverty Law Center. CASSIE MILLER: There is a much broader authoritarian movement that's at work right now in the American political right. And, you know, the GOP needs to really vocally oppose this kind of growing authoritarian segment of their party.

The teenager consumed one tortilla chip that, despite no prior health issues or allergies, led to his death several hours later. The challenge involves eating a single chip that's extremely spicy. The boy's mother is sounding a warning about the possible dangers of this viral trend. The chip was created by the company Paqui using what they tout as the world's hottest peppers. There have been multiple hospital cases tied to this product, especially among teenagers. The deceased was identified as Harris Wolobah, a sophomore at Doherty Memorial High School. According to his mother, Lois Wolobah, the chip was given to him by a classmate and he went to the school nurse with a severe stomach ache.

Recently, a 14-year-old boy from Worcester died after attempting the \"One Chip Challenge.\" People are being encouraged to know their limits. Rich Moyette has been making hot sauce for 25 years. His two shops in Massachusetts have one simple rule. \"We do not sample or sell anything to anyone under 18 years old. We will not do it unless a parent is here. We won't do it,\" says Moyette adamantly. \"I saw the news. It's a tragic, tragic story. It's horrible for anyone to pass.\" Moyette sells a similar challenge brand at his store House of Hot Sauce. He's seen someone consume 152 of these at a festival in Vermont. It's basically a tortilla chip covered in scorching spices. It's typically sold in a one chip pouch, however the one Moyette sells has two. \"It's hard to eat, hard to choke down because it's dry. You should drink something with it to get it down,\" said Moyette. \"If I were going to do the hot chip challenge, and I have a high heat level, I am going to try a piece off the top.\" He suggests this because everyone has a different tolerance level, and no chip or hot sauce is created equal. Hot sauces are measured by something called the Scoville scale, however it's not an exact science. \"If you notice 2,500 to 8,000 is the jalape\u00f1o,\" Moyette said. \"You never know which pepper you get, and how hot it is going to be coming off the plant.\" Each pepper is created differently, even within a species. A Carolina Reaper is high on the scale but ranges from 1.4 to 2.2 million Scoville. Moyette makes all customers do a personal hotness test starting with a dollop at the bottom of the scale and moving up. He watches the person's face looking for brow sweat, and redness in the face. \"Red in the eyes is to too far,\" adds Moyette. \"Everyone's body reacts to\n3. publish date: 2023-09-06, Wednesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: 'One Chip Challenge' Death: Teen's Tragedy Spurs Review of Viral Trend Safety \nbody: video by @FOX32Chicago A Massachusetts teenager's tragic death following participation in a viral social media trend has led to calls for a review of safety measures associated with such challenges. The 'One Chip Challenge', popular on platforms like TikTok, requires participants to eat a single chip that is purported to be as hot as pepper spray. The chip containing extreme levels of capsaicin, a compound in chili peppers that causes heat, comes from a product by Paqui. This incident has sparked discussions on potential age restrictions for products like these, and the need for more consumer education on their hazards. Symptoms of capsaicin poisoning include acute intestinal issues, intense vomiting, and potential damage to the esophagus. There are also reports of post-challenge chest pain and heart attacks in some participants.

The goal is internet notoriety, if not a viral reaction. Many of the challenges are on the fun side, such as the Lip Sync Challenge, and others are focused on a cause, such as the Ice Bucket Challenge, an early entry in the viral category. Video proof The challenges take hold on TikTok or other internet platforms, where video proof is part of the game plan. The Milk Crate Challenge topped the popularity charts two years ago, with participants building and climbing towers fashioned out of milk crates. The resulting tumbles were often harmless, good for a few laughs, but the videos that showed injuries were among the most popular. Some of the challenges require daring tasks, bordering on dangerous or illegal. The Kia Boyz Challenge involved stealing a car. The Benadryl Challenge was based on an unhealthy amount of medicine. More: Health information about the Paqui One Chip Challenge Carolina Reaper Some are putting the One Chip Challenge in the risky category. This TikTok trend involves eating a spicy chip without immediately reaching for water. Paqui, the chip maker, markets it as being one of the spiciest available. The rating system for hot peppers, the Scoville Scale, puts Paqui's creation among the hottest. On its website, the company offers a series of warnings about the chip, including that it is not for children and that medical assistance should be sought if someone who eats the chip has breathing difficulty. Paqui sells packages that contain one chip, with a mix of Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers. For those who eat one, there is sure to be a reaction \u2014 with the challenge being how long the person can hold out without having a glass of water or other drink. Paqui has a rating system, with a one-minute wait warranting no praise, up to a one-hour wait deserving of endless praise.

Taylor\u2019s heroic actions on June 18, 1968 that saved four lives during the Vietnam War earned him the award. The big day brought Taylor\u2019s family, friends, and classmates from Saint Elmo Elementary together for the ceremony along with members of The Rocky Top Battalion from UT Knoxville\u2019s ROTC, and the Vietnam Veterans Association. The long list of guests also included other Medal of Honor recipients, who welcomed Larry Taylor into their fraternity. The 81-year-old was in high spirits Monday night speaking to fellow veterans he hadn\u2019t seen since Vietnam. And 55 years later, he is still very humble about heroic actions from 1968, but God is here today. His challenge coin for this occasion bears the motto \u201cLeave No Man Behind\u201d. It\u2019s a fitting slogan for a man who still insists he was just doing his job. \u201cWell, nobody got killed. So, we managed to pull everybody out and we pulled it off.

Reporters questioned Jean-Pierre on Biden leaving right after placing a medal on former U.S. Army Captain and Vietnam War veteran Larry Taylor but before the concluding prayer. Biden had stayed for the benediction at other Medal of Honor ceremonies. While his early exit was criticized online, the press secretary insisted that it was all planned. \"He left as planned, as it was planned,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters. \"He left when there was a pause in the program in order to minimize his close contact with attendees who are about to participate in a reception.\" She added, \"We've got to put this all in context. We planned for the president to leave when there was a pause in the program so that it would minimize him being in the room. He did just that.

The incident took place Tuesday just after Biden placed the medal on former U.S. Army Captain Larry Taylor. Taylor, 81, received the medal for heroic action during the Vietnam War. In 1968, the then-1st Lt. Taylor flew his helicopter into harm\u2019s way to rescue four of his comrades who were surrounded by the enemy and facing certain death.

No light beyond the glow of Lieutenant Taylor\u2019s cockpit control, when he heard a whisper coming through his radio, \u2018We\u2019re surrounded.\u2019 Lieutenant Taylor knew the risks, but he was ready.\" READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP Towards the end of the ceremony, Biden placed the medal around Taylor\u2019s neck, and, rather than wait there for the audience to finish applauding and the MC to read the concluding prayer, he walked down the aisle and appeared to leave the ceremony. The benediction was then read as Taylor stood onstage by himself. Someone in the crowd seemed to gesture to Taylor to remain standing up front despite the president having left.

He eventually became more critical of Rubiales, saying the kiss tarnished \"a well-deserved victory for our players and our country.\" The federation, in a lengthy statement, acknowledged the \"damage caused\" by Rubiales\u2019 kiss to \"Spanish society.\" \"Those actions do not reflect at all the values of the whole Spanish society, its institutions, its representatives, its athletes and the leaders of Spanish sport,\" according to the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF). \"Spanish society is an example of tolerance and civility, in all social and political spheres and has been an example of behavior and sporting decorum, as it has demonstrated for decades in all sporting events in which it has participated.\" The federation continued: \"That nobility and international prestige of our society and our sport have been tarnished in recent days by the actions of Mr. Luis Rubiales. The damage caused to Spanish football, to Spanish sport, to Spanish society and to the values of football and sport as a whole has been enormous\n3. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Spain soccer coach Jorge Vilda fired amid Luis Rubiales\u2019 World Cup kiss scandal\nbody: Jorge Vilda, the controversial Spanish women\u2019s soccer coach who supported federation president Luis Rubiales during his World Cup kiss scandal, was fired Tuesday amid the latter\u2019s FIFA-instituted suspension. Vilda was the coach of the Spanish club that won the World Cup last month , despite numerous players criticizing the team\u2019s culture under his leadership ahead of the international soccer tournament. Many of the players who condemned Vilda did not compete in the World Cup. Rubiales stood by Vilda through that controversy. Vilda then initially supported Rubiales\u2019 refusal to resign as president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) after his unsolicited kiss of Spanish soccer star Jenni Hermoso following the World Cup win garnered widespread outrage. Vilda has since spoken out against Rubiales\u2019 kiss. The RFEF fired Vilda shortly after it released a statement Tuesday calling Rubiales\u2019 behavior \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d In addition to kissing Hermoso on the lips during the medal ceremony, Rubiales grabbed his crotch in celebration after Spain\u2019s 1-0 win in the title game over England as 16-year-old Princess Infanta Sof\u00eda stood nearby. \u201cThose actions do not reflect at all the values of the whole Spanish society, its institutions, its representatives, its athletes and the leaders of Spanish sport,\u201d said Pedro Rocha, who is currently serving as RFEF president. \u201cThe damage caused to Spanish football, to Spanish sport, to Spanish society and to the values of football and sport as a whole has been enormous.\u201d Last week, FIFA suspended Rubiales for 90 days amid an investigation by its disciplinary committee.

The changes come amid the continuing fallout over the actions of federation president Luis Rubiales at the Women's World Cup final \u2014 which included forcibly kissing star forward Jenni Hermoso and making a lewd crotch-grabbing gesture. In its sacking of Vilda on Tuesday, the federation said \"Gracias, Jorge\" and released a statement declaring that over the course of his eight-year helm he \"has been key to the remarkable growth of women's football and leaves Spain as world champion and second in the FIFA ranking.\" The statement by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, known as the RFEF, doesn't mention that Vilda's job had hung in the balance due to his connection to Rubiales and the global condemnation he has received following Spain's victory at the tournament last month. The members of Spain's World Cup-winning team and dozens of other Spanish players had announced on August 25 that they would refuse to play for Spain while \"the current leaders\" continue. Many understood that to mean that the players were demanding the removal of both Rubiales and Vilda. The appointment of Tom\u00e9 sends a message Tom\u00e9, a former player, had been assistant coach to Vilda since 2018. The team's first matches with Tom\u00e9 at the helm will be in the UEFA Women's Nations League, against Sweden and Switzerland \u2014 both teams that Spain beat at the Women's World Cup. Her appointment came immediately after Vilda's firing, and its message was clear: a highly capable woman is now in charge of the top women's soccer team in the world\n5. publish date: 2023-09-07, Thursday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Commentary | The World Cup was internationally groundbreaking for female athletes\nbody: The 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup was one for the books. A record 32 teams participated \u2014 eight of which made their first World Cup appearance \u2014 and games spread across two countries for the first time in nine tournaments, with Spain taking the crown on Aug. 20. Needless to say, it\u2019s worth talking about. Australia and New Zealand\u2019s co-hosted tournament gathered nearly 2 million in-person spectators, according to BBC, which is 600,000 more than the previous attendance record. Following the historic competition and Spain\u2019s victory, attention turned toward a non-consensual kiss from Spain Football Federation President Luis Rubiales on player Jenni Hermoso. This incident is upsetting and deserves to be brought to light but should not overshadow the positive impacts of the tournament.

Because of financial limitations, the JFF disbanded the women\u2019s team in 2008 and again in 2016.

The winning goal of the World Cup final was scored by Olga Carmona, a left-back defender and the Spanish national team captain. Carmona also plays left-back for her club team Real Madrid Femenino.

The team\u2019s president, surprisingly, kissed a player without seeking her permission. This incident underscores the rampant sexism and unfair treatment women in sports frequently deal with. Experts stress that this incident is not isolated, but a symptom of a stronger bias and lack of respect for women athletes. Despite displaying remarkable abilities and persistence, these players often face unnecessary criticism and disrespect. In other news, the Supreme Court's new ruling to abolish affirmative action has raised questions about its far-reaching effects on diversity and equality in fields other than education. There is an expected change in the racial mix of graduates joining the workforce. This could significantly skew corporate diversity strategies. Specialists are urging businesses to stay committed to their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives.

The Mysterious Disappearance The journey into the wilderness began on a seemingly ordinary day in late August. Adam Fuselier, an experienced hiker with a passion for exploration, embarked on a solo adventure in Glacier National Park. With the beauty of Montana's rugged terrain stretching before him, he set his sights on Reynolds Mountain, a challenging climb even for seasoned hikers. August 29 marked the last contact Adam had with his family. As the afternoon sun cast long shadows over the mountains, they received his final communication. Little did they know that this would be the last time they heard from their beloved son and brother. A Desperate Wait Days passed, and Adam did not return from his expedition. Concern turned into panic as his family realized that something was amiss. On the following day, park rangers were alerted about an overdue hiker named Adam Fuselier.

The weather did them no favours, with fog, rain, and gusty winds complicating their efforts. Adam's vehicle served as a chilling clue to his last-known location, as it was found parked at Logan Pass, the highest point in the park accessible by car.

Larry Taylor , a Cobra helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War, will join the over 30 Tennesseans who have received the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions on the battlefield in various conflicts. Tennessee has a rich history of war heroes, according to the Charles H. Coolidge National Medal of Honor Heritage Center , where the images and citations of all 32 Medal of Honor recipients are displayed in the Hall of Valor in downtown Chattanooga. Biden to award Medal of Honor to Vietnam-era Army officer With the exception of the War on Terror, a Tennessean has received the Medal of Honor in every conflict since the military decoration was first created in 1861. According to the Heritage Center, the Department of Defense credits their actions to the state where they enlisted. The Medal of Honor is considered the highest military decoration someone can receive, with recipients\u2019 stories demonstrating moments of bravery and sometimes sacrifice in defense of the United States. Some have gone it alone amid onslaughts of gunfire, and many have faced what would appear to be insurmountable odds, but come out inspiring their fellow servicemembers, with multiple Medal of Honor recipients throwing themselves on grenades to absorb the blast. Last World War II Medal of Honor recipient, Hershel \u2018Woody\u2019 Williams, dies at 98 As of March 3, 2023, there have been 3,535 Medals of Honor awarded in the country, with over 1,000 awarded to Americans who fought in the Civil War, according to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States.

Joining the ranks of 32 Medal of Honor recipients from Tennessee, Taylor is the sixth from the Vietnam War period.

(WKRN) \u2014 A Vietnam veteran and Chattanooga hero will be going to the White House next week, where President Joe Biden will present him with the Medal of Honor. Capt. Larry Taylor will be the 33rd Tennessean to receive the Medal of Honor, which is the highest military decoration a person can receive for their valor in combat, according to the Coolidge National Medal of Honor Heritage Center in Chattanooga. Biden to award Medal of Honor to Vietnam-era Army officer Taylor distinguished himself while serving as one of the first Cobra helicopter pilots during the Vietnam War. While Taylor was a part of many harrowing operations, the Heritage Center said one operation rises above all others. On the night of June 18, 1968, a four-man Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) team was surveilling a village occupied by around 80 North Vietnamese. A fight ensued and the soldiers quickly realized they were surrounded. After the soldiers radioed for air support, Taylor and his co-pilot J.O. Ratliff, along with one other Cobra helicopter, flew over the area and provided support until they were out of rockets and ammunition. Realizing the LRRP team was surrounded with little, if any, options, Taylor radioed the team leader and made an \u201cunusual request,\u201d according to the Heritage Center. He asked the soldiers to create a diversion, run 100 yards and lie down in the grass. Medal of Honor recipient\u2019s remains ID\u2019d 73 years after Korea The soldiers followed his orders and were surprised as they realized Taylor was landing his Cobra in the middle of the battlefield. The Cobra helicopter had no place to transport troops, so Taylor ordered the soldiers to jump onto the helicopter skids and rocket pods and hold on tight. Taylor then lifted the four men, David Hill of Visalia, Cali.; Robert Elsner of New York City; Gerald Patty of Maryville, Tenn.; and William P. Cohn of Norwich, Conn. out of the fight and to a safer location miles away. For his actions that night, Taylor was awarded the Silver Star, which President Biden has now upgraded to a Medal of Honor. The president will present Taylor with the Medal of Honor on Tuesday, Sept. 5 at the White House in Washington D.C. Not only will he be the 33rd Tennessean to receive the decoration, but Taylor will be the sixth soldier with ties to the Chattanooga area to have received the Medal of Honor. He also was awarded 61 combat decorations, including 44 Air Medals, for his service. Last World War II Medal of Honor recipient, Hershel \u2018Woody\u2019 Williams, dies at 98 After being engaged by enemy fire 340 times and forced down five times, Taylor concluded his four years of military service with the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in West Germany.

According to reports, over 75,000 attendees were left stranded in the desert after experiencing heavy rains that resulted in thick mud and severe flooding that went on for miles. People who wanted to get out of the location had to go on foot and walk for miles, which is exactly what artists Diplo and Chris Rock did. Those who were left behind in Burning Man had to wait for days before they were eventually evacuated, which resulted in tension among attendees. \"As usually happens in what burners refer to as the 'default world' people allow their emotions to override their reasonableness and they are lashing out at each other as they leave the playa and attempt to make it to their next destination,\" said Pershing County Sheriff Jerry Allen.

In what would be his first foreign travel since the start of the pandemic, Kim may visit Russia this month for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a U.S. official has said, possibly to discuss North Korean arms sales to refill Russian reserves drained by its war on Ukraine. According to U.S. reports, the two leaders could meet in the eastern city of Vladivostok, the site of their first get-together in April 2019, when Kim took his green-and-yellow train. Putin is expected in the city for the annual Eastern Economic Forum that runs from Sunday to Wednesday. The reports come at a time when the leaders' interests are aligning in the face of their deepening, separate confrontations with the United States. Whether Kim could again make the rattling 20-hour journey by rail is a focus of media attention, as is the reportedly luxurious train, which stands in sharp contrast to the grinding poverty of daily life for most North Koreans. Kim\u2019s famously flight-averse father, Kim Jong Il, made about a dozen trips abroad during his 17-year rule, almost all to China and all by train. North Korea\u2019s state media said that the elder Kim died of a heart attack during a train trip in 2011. According to an account published in 2002 by Konstantin Pulikovsky, a Russian official who accompanied Kim Jong ll on a three-week trip to Moscow, the train carried cases of expensive French wine and passengers could feast on fresh lobster and pork barbeque. The train\u2019s most important feature, however, is security. According to South Korean media reports, North Korea has 90 special carriages in total and operates three trains in tandem when a leader is traveling \u2014 an advance train to check the rails, the train with the leader and his immediate entourage, and a third behind for everyone else. High-tech communication equipment and flat-screen TVs are installed so a leader can give orders and receive briefings.\n2. publish date: 2023-09-04, Monday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un may meet with Putin in Russia this month, US official says\nbody: WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A U.S. official said Monday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may travel to Russia soon to meet with President Vladimir Putin as the Kremlin tries to acquire military equipment for use in its war in Ukraine. The official, who was not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. expects Kim will make the trip within the month. The official said the U.S. isn\u2019t sure exactly where or when the meeting would take place, but the Pacific port city of Vladivostok would be a likely possibility given its relative proximity to North Korea. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson noted Monday that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to Pyongyang recently and tried to persuade North Korea to sell artillery ammunition to Russia. Watson said, \u201cWe have information that Kim Jong Un expects these discussions to continue, to include leader-level diplomatic engagement in Russia.\u201d She added that the U.S. is urging North Korea \u201cto cease its arms negotiations with Russia and abide by the public commitments that Pyongyang has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia.\u201d Shoigu said Monday that the two countries may hold joint war games. The New York Times first reported that Kim planned to meet with Putin in Russia this month. The White House said last week that it had intelligence indicating that Putin and Kim swapped letters following Shoigu\u2019s visit. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the letters were \u201cmore at the surface level\u201d but that Russian and North Korean talks on a weapons sale were advancing. ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this story. ___ An earlier version of this story quoted an NSC spokeswoman saying Russia\u2019s Defense Minister traveled to Pyongyang last month.

In return, experts say, North Korea will probably ask for food, energy shipments and transfers of sophisticated weapons technologies. A meeting with Putin would be Kim\u2019s first summit with a foreign leader since North Korea closed its borders in January 2020. According to U.S. officials, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to Pyongyang in July and asked Kim to send more ammunition to Russia.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Beyond barbecues and the unofficial end of summer, Labor Day holds a rich history and significant meaning that deserves recognition. In this article, we will delve into the origins of Labor Day, its evolution over time, and the enduring importance it holds in our society. The Birth of Labor Day: The concept of Labor Day dates back to the late 19th century, a period of rapid industrialization in the United States. Labor conditions were often harsh, with long working hours, low wages, and minimal worker protections. Amidst growing social tensions, workers' rights organizations and labor unions campaigned for change. The First Labor Day: On September 5, 1882, the Central Labor Union of New York City organized the first Labor Day parade. It was a momentous event that brought together thousands of workers from various trades to march through the streets, demanding better working conditions, shorter hours, and fair wages. This celebration of labor quickly spread throughout the country, leading to the recognition and establishment of Labor Day as a national holiday. Recognized as a National Holiday: In response to the increasing significance of Labor Day, the United States Congress passed an act on June 28, 1894, officially designating the first Monday in September as a national holiday to honor workers. President Grover Cleveland signed the act into law, ensuring that Labor Day would be a recognized and celebrated holiday across the nation. Celebration and Symbolism: Labor Day holds different meanings for different people. For some, it represents the hard-fought victories of the labor movement, marked by improved working conditions, fair wages, and worker rights protections. It is a day to acknowledge the contributions of everyday workers who build and sustain the economy. Beyond BBQs and Sales: While Labor Day has evolved into a day of relaxation, outdoor activities, and shopping deals, it's important to remember its historical significance and honor its original intent. Amidst the festivities, take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices of those who came before us\n2. publish date: 2023-09-04, Monday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: Why we celebrate Labor Day and the meaning behind it\nbody: (CNN) \u2014 You probably associate Labor Day with sales, family barbecues and the unofficial end of summer. For most Americans, the long weekend is a much-needed opportunity to reconnect with friends and family and provides a last hurrah before the start of fall. But Monday's holiday holds a much deeper meaning, rooted in the 19th century fight for fair working conditions. Labor Day was originally designed to honor workers as part of the American organized labor movement. When Labor Day started Labor Day was first celebrated unofficially by labor activists and individual states in the late 1800s, according to the US Department of Labor. New York was the first state to introduce a bill recognizing Labor Day, but Oregon was the first to actually codify it into law in 1887. Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had followed suit by the end of 1887. Joshua Freeman, a labor historian and professor emeritus at the City University of New York, tells CNN that the holiday developed as unions were beginning to strengthen again after the 1870s recession. In New York City, two events converged that contributed to the formation of Labor Day, Freeman says. First, the now-defunct Central Labor Union was formed as a \"umbrella body\" for unions across trades and ethnic groups. Additionally, the Knights of Labor, then the largest national labor convention, held a convention in the city, complete with a large parade. But the parade fell on a Tuesday at the start of September \u2013 and many workers were unable to attend. The convention was a huge success, and unions around the country started holding their own labor celebrations at the start of September, usually on the first Monday of the month. At the beginning, \"it was a somewhat daring move to participate, because you could get yourself fired,\" Freedman said. But over time, states began to recognize the holiday, and it became more common for employers to give their employees the day off. It wasn't until June 28, 1894 that Congress passed an act naming the first day of September a legal holiday called Labor Day. Freeman says that earlier that year, President Grover Cleveland sent in the military to squash the Pullman railway strike. Cleveland pushed through legislation to recognize Labor Day just days after\n3. publish date: 2023-09-04, Monday\nreference source quality: good\ntitle: The Origin and Evolution of Labor Day: Honoring America's Workers\nbody: video by @ChronicleWCVB Labor Day's origin traces back to the late 19th century. It's credited to union leader Peter J. McGuire. He proposed celebrating the American labor force. This idea lead to the first Labor Day parade on September 5, 1882, in New York City. The parade championed for workers' rights. The holiday became legally recognized in 1894. It has grown into more than just a tribute to labor's role in the nation's prosperity. During the Great Depression, the National Recovery Act, introduced by Franklin D. Roosevelt, addressed unemployment and boosted unions. In this era, the workforce evolved. Women began working during World War II and fought to hold their jobs after the war. Today, Labor Day symbolizes appreciation for American workers. It's celebrated with parades, outdoor gatherings, and retail sales. The holiday reflects the journey from advocating for fair labor practices to gaining national recognition. Thus, it marks the end of summer unofficially and reminds us of the American workforce's resilience and accomplishments.

People know it is having an extra day off from work and school, but its meaning goes much further than just the long weekend. According to the U.S. Department of Labor , the day is \u201can annual celebration of the social and economic achievements of American workers.\u201d The holidays stem from the late 1800s when labor activists wanted a federal holiday to recognize workers\u2019 contributions to the country. What stores, restaurants are open on Labor Day? The very first Labor Day was celebrated in New York back in September 1882, in accordance with the plans of the Central Labor Union. Labor Day was originally started as a holiday that was only seen in individual states. In 1886, New York was to first state to introduce a bill trying to secure federal legislation, but Oregon was the first to pass the law recognizing the day. Smash Mouth front man Steve Harwell dead at 56, band confirms In 1887, four more states passed laws recognizing the day as a holiday and by 1894, 27 more states followed. On June 28, 1894, Congress officially passed an act making the first Monday in September a legal holiday with President Grover Cleveland signing it into law. Today, many Americans celebrate Labor Day with parades, festivals, and parties, similar to those outlined by the first proposal of the holiday back in the late 19th century.

Last month was not only the hottest August scientists ever recorded by far with modern equipment, it was also the second hottest month measured, behind only July 2023, WMO and the European climate service Copernicus announced Wednesday. August was about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial averages. That is the threshold that the world is trying not to pass, though scientists are more concerned about rises in temperatures over decades, not merely a blip over a month\u2019s time. The world\u2019s oceans \u2014 more than 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface \u2014 were the hottest ever recorded, nearly 21 C (69.8 F), and have set high temperature marks for three consecutive months, the WMO and Copernicus said. \u201cThe dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. \u201cClimate breakdown has begun.\u201d So far, 2023 is the second hottest year on record, behind 2016, according to Copernicus. Scientists blame ever warming human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas with an extra push from a natural El Nino, which is a temporary warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. Usually an El Nino, which started earlier this year, adds extra heat to global temperatures but more so in its second year. Climatologist Andrew Weaver said the numbers announced by WMO and Copernicus come as no surprise, bemoaning how governments have not appeared to take the issue of global warming seriously enough. He expressed concern that the public will just forget the issue when temperatures fall again. \u201cIt\u2019s time for global leaders to start telling the truth,\u201d said Weaver, a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria in Canada. \u201cWe will not limit warming to 1.5 C; we will not limit warming to\n4. publish date: 2023-09-05, Tuesday\nreference source quality: poor\ntitle: Dangerous heat wave hits eastern US: Latest forecast\nbody: This week might bring the first heat wave of the season for New York City.

The Long History of Pandas Abroad, Explained\nbody: When you think of fuzzy white paws and adorable black ears, chances are, you're thinking of a panda bear . These bears are native to China and eat a steady diet of foliage composed mostly of bamboo. The creatures are also most notable as a national symbol of China, but starting in 1961, they have also served as the mascots for the World Wildlife Fund following their endangered status . Due to their popularity globally, the National Zoo in Washington D.C. has received a lot of attention for hosting \"gift\" pandas since 1972. However, according to NPR , the National Zoo will officially return its three pandas to China on Dec. 7, 2023. Why are pandas going back to China? Here's the long history of pandas abroad explained. So, why are pandas going back to China? Two pandas, Mei Xiang, and Tian Tian, first arrived at the National Zoo in 2000 as part of an agreement between the National Zoo and the China Wildlife and Conservation Association. CBS News reported that the pair were meant to spend only 10 years at the zoo as part of an international breeding and conservation agreement. China extended the agreement in 2020 after the birth of the male cub Xiao Qi Ji, but the extension was only until 2023. It's unclear where the pandas will return once they reach China. China does have many giant panda sanctuaries, including Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries in 3 locations (Wolong, Mt Siguniang, and Jiajin Mountains) that host more than 30 percent of the world's panda population, per UNESCO.

It will be the last one he'll celebrate on U.S. soil. As soon as the birthday boy appeared, meandering toward his birthday \"Young, Wild and 3\" themed treats, an excited hush fell over the crowd. The Smithsonian celebrated the occasion in style, presenting a showstopping fruitsicle cake made with panda-friendly apple and pineapple juice, mashed sweet potatoes, carrots, honey, and leafy bamboo sprigs. The celebration was bittersweet, however, with news coming out that the Xiao Qi Ji and his D.C. bear family will be headed back to China by year's end. No replacements have been scheduled. Sadly, it's an experience San Diegans \u2014 and, especially, the San Diego zoo staff \u2014 are all too familiar with. The San Diego Zoo said farewell in 2018 to its most recognizable fuzzy resident: Gao Gao, a giant panda who helped lead conservation efforts for the species. Gao Gao \u2013 a father of five cubs, all born in San Diego \u2013 lived at the facility for the prior 15 years as part of a long-term loan agreement with the People\u2019s Republic of China. The Panda Canyon exhibit at the San Diego Zoo continued to be home to two giant pandas \u2013 Bai-Yun, 27, and her son, Xiao Liwu, 6 \u2014 until the following year, when they, too were sent to China.

DC's National Zoo to host 9-day send-off 'Panda Palooza'\nbody: WASHINGTON (7News) \u2014 It's nearly time to say farewell to three giant pandas who have long been a staple at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The pandas are headed back to China to honor an agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, and the zoo is preparing a celebration send-off! Panda Palooza will be held beginning Saturday, Sept. 23 to Sunday, Oct. 1, and will include activities of all ages for family-friendly fun, according to the zoo. Some of the listed programming will include: Hashtag-worthy photo backdrops Hands-on arts and crafts 'Kids Area\u2019 in the Great Meadow with a soft play section Chalkboard, coloring and stamping activities Morning family stretching and yoga along with panda talks Temporary tattoos, a conservation-themed scavenger hunt Live music concerts on the Mainstage by Lion Tiger Hill Free film screenings of Kung Fu Panda and The Miracle Cub in the Visitor Center Theater Zoo food and beverage vendors will offer panda-themed items, and tasty celebratory treats will be provided courtesy of the Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China.

Why it matters: Pandas are as much of a D.C. symbol as cherry blossoms \u2014 and this will be the first time in decades that the city is giant panda-less. Driving the news: So naturally the zoo is sending them off with a big panda party, starting Sept. 23 ( and they know how to party ). Panda Palooza , a nine-day family friendly event, includes arts and crafts, panda talks, panda food/drink specials, conservation-themed scavenger hunts, and free screenings of \"Kung Fu Panda\" (to name a few activities). Free passes for entry are required. Catch up quick: The National Zoo's first pandas arrived in 1972 during the Nixon administration as a gift from China and diplomatic gesture . The giant bears have been a fixture since, though largely on loan from the Chinese government (hence the return). Current giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian arrived in 2000 as part of a joint research, breeding and conservation program with China. They bred four surviving cubs. Three are \"thriving\" at the China Conservation and Research Center, according to zoo officials. Xiao Qi Ji (\"Little Miracle\") was born in 2020 when Mei Xiang was 22, the second oldest panda to give documented birth. He'll return with his parents by Dec. 7. What's next: How long will D.C. be panda-less? The million yuan question.

Yang Guang and Tian Tian have lived at Edinburgh Zoo since 2011 and are the only giant pandas currently living in the UK. Keepers at the zoo had hoped that the pandas would mate but after there were no baby pandas, they gave up. The pandas were loaned to the zoo by the Chinese government, as part of their panda diplomacy scheme, and will return to the country later this year. What is panda diplomacy? Pandas are native to China where they're seen as a national treasure. All living pandas, wherever they might be, belong to the Chinese state, and no one else other than the Chinese government is allowed to own one. Panda diplomacy describes how the Chinese authorities let some governments borrow pandas as a mark of respect between their countries. Having a panda can really boost the status of a zoo, as Edinburgh Zoo saw since Tian Tian arrived in 2011. There aren't many zoos in the world that get to keep pandas - this is because it is up to China to decide which countries get them. Each zoo also has to pass strict tests to be allowed a panda, and it also costs a lot of money. Yang Guang and Tian Tian reportedly cost around \u00a3750,000 a year to loan. As well as paying the Chinese government to loan the pandas, feeding and caring for them is very expensive too. Alison Maclean, the carnivore team leader at Edinburgh Zoo, said: \"We are making arrangements with our partners in China for Yang Guang and Tian Tian to return in early December, possibly during the first week. \"Visitors to the zoo can expect to see them indoors and outside until the end of November, after which viewing will be outdoors only until they leave.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.
