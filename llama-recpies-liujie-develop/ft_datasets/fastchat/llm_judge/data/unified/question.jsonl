Did you know that re-attaching severed limbs is a routine procedure that was pioneered in the 60\u2019s and has been commonplace since the 80\u2019s? Well, we didn\u2019t know this either until we stumbled upon an amazing story of a man in England who accidentally chopped his arm off just below the elbow with a chainsaw and had it surgically re-attached hours later. After just a few months he could move his arm and fingers again and he was back to work. See the image of his repaired arm to the right.\n2. Eighty percent to 90 percent of amputated limbs can be successfully replanted (reattached after a complete amputation) or revascularized so that blood flow is restored to a severely damaged but still attached limb. The sooner a victim gets to surgery, the better the chances of a successful outcome.Types of amputations\n3. Once the injured patient arrives at the hospital, it's time for the surgical team to work its magic -- and there's a complex series of steps they take in surgery to ensure the severed limb can survive once it's reattached. First they'll reattach the bone, using pins or wire to hold it together. Then specialists will restart blood flow by suturing the arteries and blood vessels. Next, surgeons begin the laborious process of reconnecting tendons, muscle tissue and nerves, although nerve reattachment can be saved for a later date. Finally, using grafts from other parts of the patient's body if necessary, the skin is stitched back together.\n4. If an accident or trauma results in complete amputation (the body part is totally severed), the part sometimes can be reattached, often when proper care is taken of the severed part and stump, or residual limb.\n5. Since then, limb-reattachment surgery has improved, as have the prospects for those who accidentally amputate limbs. But what should you do to maximize the odds of reattachment success if you find yourself carrying your own detached limb with you to the hospital?

Penn and co-authors say that other shifts in the ocean environment, such as acidification or changes in the productivity of photosynthetic organisms, probably contributed to the Permian extinction, but that warmer temperatures leading to insufficient oxygen levels accounts for more than half of the losses in marine life.\n2. - Penn led a team of researchers that combined models of ocean conditions and animal metabolism with paleoceanographic records to show that the Permian mass extinction was caused by rising ocean temperatures, which in turn forced the metabolism of marine animals to speed up. Increased metabolism meant increased need for oxygen, but the warmer waters could not hold enough oxygen to meet those needs, and ocean life was left gasping for breath.\n3.

According to study co-author Jonathan Payne, a professor of geological sciences at Stanford\u2019s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth), \u201cThe conventional wisdom in the paleontological community has been that the Permian extinction was especially severe in tropical waters.\u201d Yet the model shows the hardest hit were organisms most sensitive to oxygen found far from the tropics. Many species that lived in the tropics also went extinct in the model, but it predicts that high-latitude species, especially those with high oxygen demands, were nearly completely wiped out.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The purpose of a clutch in a car is to transmit the torque, deliver the power from the engine to the transmission, reduce drive vibration, and to protect the drivetrain. The clutch is located between the engine and the transmission of a vehicle.\n2. As you might have understood by now, the car clutch is a complex component, involving different parts at work. So it makes it quite obvious that if one of the parts might not work properly it isn\u2019t necessary to replace the entire clutch system. A small change here, a small replacement there, and you\u2019ll be good to go.\n3. The clutch connects these two shafts, allowing for either to lock together and spin at the same speed, or decouple and spin at different speeds. In most vehicles, the clutch sits between the engine and the main driveshaft, modulating torque and power from the engine to the wheels. Torque is simply any force applied at a distance. It\u2019s measured in foot-pounds or newton-meters.\n4. Before diagnosing your clutch problems, it\u2019s important to understand what a clutch is and how it works in regard to your vehicle\u2019s powertrain. A clutch is a mechanical component in a vehicle or other mechanical device that engages and disengages a powertrain or transmission between several rotating shafts.\n5. You need a clutch in your car because the engine spins all the time, but your car\u2019s wheels don\u2019t. To stop your car without stopping the engine, you need a way to disengage the wheels from the engine. Through the friction of the engine\u2019s flywheel and the clutch disc, you can engage your spinning engine to a sometimes-spinning transmission and visa-versa.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Microsoft aims to release frequent updates to the Xbox One console, mainly containing new or improved features and faster installation and loading times for games and apps. Along with introducing improvements and fixes for native console apps and software, the monthly updates to the Xbox One system software introduce major features that are voted on or requested by the community, though some months have included more than one update. Starting in February 2014, beta releases of updates are tested before going live to check for unwanted bugs and stability.\n2. 51. ^ Weir, Andy (July 24, 2014). \"Microsoft: Xbox One monthly updates will keep on coming\". Neowin.\n3. 69. ^ Kamen, Matt (February 18, 2016). \"Xbox One gets biggest software update in months\". Wired UK. Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications. Retrieved April 8, 2016.\n4. The original Xbox runs a custom operating system which is based on a heavily modified version of Windows 2000, an approach that Microsoft engineer Don Box called \"fork and run\". It exports APIs similar to those found in Microsoft Windows, such as Direct3D. While Windows 2000 was built for multitasking of multiple applications including memory paging, the Xbox console was planned to only run one application at a time, and these features were removed for the Xbox software. When loading a game, the operating system would unload itself to give all of the console's resources to the game, and then when the player left the game, the operating system would load back up again.\n5. The good news is that for all the console's changes, the Xbox One still plays games pretty well. Installing everything to a 500GB HDD remains a pain, but there's support for external drives now, which renders that complaint mostly moot. Armchair pundits love griping every time a multi-platform game comes out and runs at a lower native resolution on the Xbox One versus PS4, but unless you have both versions running side by side, it's going to be difficult to tell the difference. Sure, there are edge-case scenarios, but I haven't seen any instances of games being unplayable. Really, the more game developers work with the Xbox One and familiarize themselves with the hardware, the better the performance will be.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

In music, transposition refers to the process or operation of moving a collection of notes (pitches or pitch classes) up or down in pitch by a constant interval.\n2. Transposition is simply taking a melody, chord sequence or whole piece of music and changing the pitch of the notes while keeping the relative intervals between them the same.\n3. Transposition is familiar from music in entertainment. For example, in a sporting event like a baseball game, an organ player will play a short phrase of music and then repeat it higher and higher each time, building intensity. Similarly, a composer may repeat a melody higher and higher to build tension, such as in film scores or when approaching the climax of a song.\n4.

During the 1970s, marijuana was both vilified and idolized, with a person\u2019s stand representing more than an opinion of the plant itself. Cannabis was (and to some extent is) a cultural pivot point, used as both a symbol of authority and anti-authority, and counter-culture that evolved into its own culture. Between the dichotomy of these political and social issues, another group was ready to be heard.\n2. The story of 420 begins with five teens in San Rafael, California who often hung out by the wall outside their school, earning them the nickname \u2018The Waldos.\u2019 In autumn 1971, the Waldos were given a treasure map that was purported to reveal the location of a patch of orphaned cannabis plants. The owner was a Coast Guard member who could no longer tend his hidden crop, and it\u2019s rumored that he himself provided the group the treasure map.\n3. Many people are falling in love with it, and celebrities are no exception. The world-famous rapper Snoop Dogg, who for years has been an avid supporter of marijuana use, advertising his innate passion for the good weed without making a secret of it, has chosen to be an integral part of the industry, launching his own cannabis brand, 'Leafs of Snoop'.\n4. In the 1920s, recreational cannabis was growing as a fine companion in the underground party scene becoming just as popular in the speakeasy as whisky in a teacup. In fact, The Volstead Act of 1920 raised the price of alcohol in the U.S., making marijuana an even more attractive alternative. \u201cIn some respects, the [widespread] use of marijuana may have been an ironic and unintentional outcome of Prohibition.\u201d - Barney Warf, Professor at University of Kansas. Recreational marijuana use soon spread from the speakeasies to the jazz clubs, and was particularly popular among the black jazz community and \u2018hepsters.\u2019  Famous jazz singer Cab Calloway even wrote a hit tune about a comical conversation with someone high, Reefer Man. Famous singer Louis Armstrong was another lifelong fan of the herb, which he called \u201cgage.\u201d\n5. The Beatles' Revolver is undoubtedly one of the most famous (and most discussed) songs about marijuana: contrary to popular belief, it is not a celebration of love for a woman, but rather for the renowned plant material, which Paul McCartney himself appreciated.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. In short, the transmission of data wirelessly is made possible by the manipulation of radio waves. These waves are generated naturally by generating pulses of electricity. These radio waves can then be modified by their amplitude or frequency in order to transmit sound or data. This process can also be improved in order to increase the amount of data transmitted as well as the speed by which the data can be transmitted. As is illustrated by this blog post, the fundamentals of this process are relatively simple but can quickly become complex as the process is explored in greater detail.\n2. At the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna. This voltage is applied to the radio receiver, which extracts the information signal. The receiver first uses a bandpass filter to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then amplifies the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a demodulator. The recovered signal is sent to a loudspeaker or earphone to produce sound, or a television display screen to produce a visible image, or other devices. A digital data signal is applied to a computer or microprocessor, which interacts with a human user.\n3. - Line of sight: This refers to radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions. This is the only method of propagation possible at frequencies above 30 MHz. On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 64 km (40 mi). This is the method used by cell phones, FM, television broadcasting and radar. By using dish antennas to transmit beams of microwaves, point-to-point microwave relay links transmit telephone and television signals over long distances up to the visual horizon. Ground stations can communicate with satellites and spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.\n4. Radio waves are more widely used for communication than other electromagnetic waves mainly because of their desirable propagation properties, stemming from their large wavelength. Radio waves have the ability to pass through the atmosphere in any weather, foliage, and most building materials, and by diffraction can bend around obstructions,[clarification needed] and unlike other electromagnetic waves they tend to be scattered rather than absorbed by objects larger than their wavelength.\n5. The study of radio propagation, how radio waves move in free space and over the surface of the Earth, is vitally important in the design of practical radio systems. Radio waves passing through different environments experience reflection, refraction, polarization, diffraction, and absorption. Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, making certain radio bands more useful for specific purposes than others. Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Taste preferences in humans are influenced by different factors including genetics, culture, repeated exposures and role models such as parents and siblings, and taste preferences change over time. Sweet tastes are preferred by newborns and bitter tastes are disliked by infants. In general humans are born with a biological predisposition to prefer sweet and to avoid bitter foods such as green leafy vegetables. It has been hypothesized that this predisposition evolved to attract children to energy-dense foods while discouraging the consumption of toxins. There are at least 25 known genes in the bitter taste receptor family in humans. \u201cSweet\u201d perception involves at least 3 genes, and others have been identified for sour and salty foods.\n2. When researchers consider the classic five categories of taste\u2014sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami\u2014there\u2019s little disagreement over which of them is the least understood. Creatures crave sweet for sugar and calories. A yen for umami, or savoriness, keeps many animals nourished with protein. Salt\u2019s essential for bodies to stay in fluid balance, and for nerve cells to signal. And a sensitivity to bitterness can come in handy with the whole not-poisoning-yourself thing.\n3. And yet we taste sour, strongly, and are not alone in doing so. When Dunn and his colleagues recently set out to investigate the sensation\u2019s evolutionary roots, he told me, they couldn\u2019t find a single backboned species that had definitively lost the ability to identify acidic foods, be they birds or mammals or amphibians or reptiles or fish. Admittedly, that may be a function of how few animals scientists have surveyed\u2014just several dozen\u2014but already, that makes sour a standout. Cats, otters, hyenas, and other carnivores have lost the ability to suss out sugar; giant pandas are immune to umami; dolphins, which swallow their prey whole, don\u2019t seem to be able to savor sweetness or savoriness, and have booted bitter sensitivity too. But sour sensing appears to have staying power that its cousins do not\u2014which means that it must be doing something important, perhaps something ancient.\n4. Humans can detect sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory tastes. This allows us to determine if foods are safe or harmful to eat.\n5. Most of us get in line at the ice cream shop or tear into a piece of chocolate cake without giving much thought to why we like what we do. Humans appreciate a wide variety of tastes because of our omnivorous evolutionary history and the genes we carry that allow us to sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (i.e., savory) flavors. But the same isn\u2019t true of all animals. Most cats, for example, dubiously sniff at sweets. This is because, over the course of its evolutionary history, the feline lineage lost a functional gene to detect sweet flavors. Birds also lack this gene and, usually, the sweet tooth that comes with it \u2014 but there are a few notable exceptions. Hummingbirds, for example, make a proverbial beeline for honey-sweet liquids. Why are hummingbirds sugar junkies, while robins stick with worms? New research reveals at a genetic level the evolutionary changes that account for such diverse tastes.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Another study examining centipedes showed that the points at which the legs contact the ground and sensations from surrounding legs impact their overall leg movements (Yasui et al. 2017). Centipedes can navigate different terrain with ease by coordinating their leg movements, likely through a decentralized method of sensory inputs. Scientists think this decentralization may be a way that moving robots can \u201cthink\u201d in the future.\n2. Here are the 6 reasons why you have centipedes, and why they will stick around long after you squish or flush a few.\n3. With the exception of the slow-moving soil centipedes, which are built to burrow, Chilopods can run fast. A centipede's body is suspended in a cradle of long legs. When those legs start moving, this gives the centipede more maneuverability over and around obstacles as it flees predators or chases prey. The tergites\u2014the dorsal surface of the body segments\u2014may also be modified to keep the body from swaying while in motion. This all results in the centipede being lighting-quick.\n4. Having so many legs can be advantageous because of the ability to prevent falling, as well as having other legs take over when some legs may malfunction. In order to study locomotion and maneuverability by using multiple legs simultaneously, scientists created a centipede-like robot (with 12 legs) (Aoi et al. 2016). The same study reported the important relationship between stability and maneuverability, especially during the turning experiments carried out by their robot.\n5. Should a centipede find itself in the grip of a bird or other predator, it can often escape by sacrificing a few legs. The bird is left with a beak full of legs, and the clever centipede makes a fast escape on those that remain. Since centipedes continue to molt as adults, they can usually repair the damage by simply regenerating legs. If you find a centipede with a few legs that are shorter than the others, it is likely in the process of recovering from a predator attack.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

When you\u2019re traveling for the holidays later this month, you might notice some signs on the highway that read \u201cspeed limit enforced by aircraft.\u201d If you\u2019re like me, those signs conjure images of the cops scrambling a team of jet fighters to take a driver with a lead foot off the road. In reality, it\u2019s a little less exciting. Here\u2019s how it works in Pennsylvania (where I live and always obey the speed limit), according to the state police.\n2. If a radar-enforced speed limit sign means that a police officer could be hiding nearby, does an aircraft-enforced speed limit sign mean that there is an officer in a plane somewhere above you? Well, yes and no. Most often, helicopters are used for aircraft-enforced speed limits, as helicopters have an easier time hovering in one spot in the air. While you typically won\u2019t see an aircraft recording the speeds of passing cars, it is a possibility \u2014 and some roadways are even patrolled by drones, which can operate without a a pilot.\n3.

That is only a power-on button. It is very important that you shut down your system properly. Simply turning the power off with the power switch can cause serious file system damage. While the system is on, files are in use even if you are not doing anything. Remember that there are many processes running in the background all the time, and using the power switch does not allow the graceful shutdown of your computer.\n2. If you were taught to never turn your PC off by pressing the power button, that\u2019s because older computers couldn\u2019t handle the sudden shutdown. Hitting the button would shut off all the power flowing to the computer\u2019s hardware. In other words, older computers couldn\u2019t shut down properly, which meant you would have to deal with corrupted files or lost work.\n3.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. The reason the UK still has the BS1363 plug is because it has square pins, and the manufacturers thought the Chinese would not want to invest in special tooling to make them when they had the world of round pins or cheap strip pins (as in US) to go after. Then Mrs. Thatcher came along and they decided to let the Chinese make them anyway.\n2. Of those that I've used personally - Soviet, Euro, Australian/NZ, and North American - I liked the southern one [wikipedia.org] most, strictly on the basis of convenience. It has 3 asymmetric pins, so you can grab it and plug it in correctly in one try without even looking at it, a feat I couldn't repeat with any other design. Plus, having a power switch on every plug is both handy and a good safety feature (and the switches normally also glow when turned on, so if you keep one that way you can find it in the dark).\n3. And since the pins are angled, even a two-pin version is pretty hard to accidentally wiggle free compared to the two round pin European plug (I think some European countries have extra bits as well that might help?). Definitely does not deserve comparison to the awful American plug design.\n4. > There's also a second reason British plugs are robust and fused: they're built to carry up to 3 kilowatts at 230 volts. (None of your wimpish American 110 volt mains juice here! Nothing quite makes your hair stand on end like accidentally touching a live pin carrying 230 volts and 13 amps ...)\n5. Australian plugs aren't designed to carry any significant physical weight, as far as I could tell (I was in Melbourne a month ago). The thickness of the live and neutral blades is similar to that of American/Japanese plugs, rather than the round pins common in the EU or the rectangular cross-section pins used in the UK. On the other hand? \"Nowhere near as horrible\" fits the bill for about 95% of purposes -- because nobody should be expecting a 230 volt mains plug and socket to double as a structural support!\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. As holders of the IP rights in its creative works, Marvel has been able to leverage the commercial value of its superheroes through a series of profitable licensing agreements. These agreements define and structure the business relationship between the licensee and the licensor, outlining the terms and conditions by which a manufacturer may produce, for example, a toy in the likeness of a given character.\n2. Marvel\u2019s robust IP assets have without a doubt enabled it to reap enormous benefits from its licensing activities. Its low-risk movie-licensing strategy has meant that film studios carry all the financial risk in developing the film, while creating multiple marketing opportunities for Marvel. Even where a film, such as Ang Lee\u2019s Hulk, disappointed at the box office, Marvel enjoyed significant revenue from film-related merchandise sales and an upsurge of interest in its comic books. Sales of the role play toys known as \u201cHulk Hands\u201d (a pair of large costume gloves), for example, have been valued at US$100 million. Moreover, Marvel\u2019s astute business strategy has enabled it to further leverage the commercial value of its characters by striking licensing deals across multiple media platforms.\n3. When asked whether Marvel Studios was considering ways to bring film-licensed characters back home in an interview with HeyUGuys, Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios\u2019 President said, \u201cthe contracts are all very specific, and if there is ever a time for them to revert, they will. But right now they are safely at those studios\u2026 The truth is\u2026 there are almost 8,000 characters in the Marvel library\u2026 and not all of them would make a movie, but a lot of them will.\u201d\n4. Comics may also be protected under trademark law. Trademarks are used to protect the names and likenesses of Marvel\u2019s comic book superheroes. This protection has been key to enabling Marvel to build and secure sizeable revenue from character merchandizing, an activity that has been further boosted by the company\u2019s movie licensing strategy.\n5. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Marvel\u2019s licensing strategy enabled it to distribute its characters beyond comic books to multiple media formats, including films, television, and video games. Today, Marvel\u2019s merchandizing reach has no limits, and can include anything from toys to perfume and clothing to luxury cars. During this period, Marvel sold options to major studios to produce films based on its characters. Despite the success of its character-licensing business, Marvel was keen to acquire full control over its creative assets and a greater stake in the box office returns generated by these movies. The creation of Marvel Studios in August 1996 was an important step in achieving this goal.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Since the beginning of heavy music, whether that be Sabbath and Zeppelin or even their classical forefathers, there\u2019s been a concern that such dark, aggressive sounding music must be something truly evil. Connections to Satan have been made repeatedly, with some ultra-conservatives blaming metal for various societal woes, such as violence, depraved sex, or social distortions.\n2. The upcoming section will consist of a quick overview of how metal music came to be associated with the satanic, while the theoretical framework will elaborate on the related subjects of religion and popular music, and religion and metal. Next, for the textual-analytical section, the paper will shift to an explanation of the origins of modern Satanism as background information for a non-exhaustive close reading of the lyrics. For this part of the inquiry, I will also be using interviews with the band and reviews of their albums to support my analysis. The paper will end by taking stock of the discussed subjects and presenting some preliminary findings, followed by a conclusion in which an answer to the research question will be provided.\n3. Still, the association of metal with the devil is far from absolute. There are many metal bands that rarely refer to the satanic in their music like Deep Purple and the Scorpions, and even Black Sabbath has songs in their repertoire that do not mention the devil at all. The late hard rock and heavy metal musician Ronnie James Dio was an interesting figure in this regard, because he rose to prominence as the vocalist of Rainbow singing about epic fantasy, then joined Black Sabbath to replace Ozzy Osbourne after the original singer had left, and eventually started his own band named Dio to make music that included references to the satanic. Finally, there are also examples of metal inspired by war and chaos in more secular historical terms and seemingly separated from biblical eschatology, such as in the music of the power metal band Sabaton and the 1982 song \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d by Iron Maiden.\n4. Metal is an easy target for such claims. Satanic imagery and even traditional Christian imagery has always been associated with metal. According to the Bible and traditional lore, nothing is scarier than the devil, no place has the power to instill horror like Hell, and no being is more powerful than a vengeful god who will rain down fire and brimstone, smiting an entire land. So clearly, a lot of seminal bands have co-opted religious iconography or language to invoke these powerful themes. Think Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Eyehategod, and Lamb of God, among many others.\n5. The answer is actually very short, simple, and straightforward: in fact there isn't all that much Satanist stuff in heavy metal, although it may seem so to the casual observer. But since such an answer is hardly satisfying, and would make for a very short chapter, let's modify the question a bit: \u201cWhy all that Satan stuff in heavy metal?\u201d Now we\u2019re getting somewhere. While outright \u201cSatanist stuff\u201d is not exactly prominent in Heavy Metal overall, there is no denying that Heavy Metal is deeply infused with references to Satan, demons, and occult lore of all sorts. However, those references take on many different forms, ranging from the overtly Satanic or occult by professedly occult and/or Satanic bands to the anti-Satanic and anti-occult by Christian metal bands, with most instances being far from either end of the spectrum.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

While a wet nose is a healthy sign in your dog, a dry nose isn\u2019t necessarily cause for worry. Young dogs that love to lick are going to have wet noses, but as dogs age, their noses typically become a bit dryer. The dryness could also be a sign that your canine is dehydrated, Dr. Lands says, so be sure your dog gets plenty of water.\n2. So although a wet nose is an indicator of good health, while a dry nose can mean the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s not always this clear. A healthy dog can have a dry or moist nose, but if they get ill can become too dry or too wet. Be on the lookout for changes like this as they can be great early warning signs your dog isn\u2019t quite tip-top. But just be sure to spot other changes too, as a dry or wet nose on its own doesn\u2019t indicate health on its own.\n3. A very, very wet nose can also be a sign that your dog is sick. Dogs are like humans in that \u201cif we start to get some sort of infection in our nose or upper respiratory infection, our noses can become more moist and we can start getting some mucus buildup in our nose or coming out of our nostrils,\u201d Dr. Lands says.\n4. Most often, a wet dog nose means they are healthy. However, a dry nose doesn\u2019t always point to a problem. The level of moisture and temperature of your dog\u2019s nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions. Sometimes, it can even fluctuate during a single day! Your pup may get a dry nose after a nap, or after intense playtime that left them dehydrated. The same is true for the temperature of your puppy's nose. Don\u2019t fret if you notice their nose is a bit warmer than usually, chances are it\u2019s just due to the weather.\n5. The answer is: sometimes! A healthy dog\u2019s nose can be wet for various reasons that help with its functions. All noses secrete some mucus to trap anything that might damage the lungs \u2013 if this drips down, the clear fluid can moisten their nose. Dogs also lick their noses regularly which makes them wet \u2013 by doing this they carry some scent particles into their mouths which can then be sensed through a special organ called the vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson\u2019s organ, in the roof of their mouth (this is one reason why smell and taste are so intricately linked).\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

A retinal scan is a biometric technique that maps the unique patterns of a person\u2019s retina using a low-intensity light source. Through a delicate sensor, a retinal scan examines the pattern of retina blood vessels, which remains unchanged from birth until death.\n2. A retinal scan is a biometric technique that uses unique patterns on a person's retina blood vessels. It is not to be confused with other ocular-based technologies: iris recognition, commonly called an \"iris scan\", and eye vein verification that uses scleral veins.\n3. Once the scanner captures a retinal image, the software compiles all the unique features of the network of retinal blood vessels (capillaries). The scanner then generates a micro sized template which helps in detecting the authentic access. Only an enrolled person can be identified with a retinal scan after acclimating to the process.\n4. The retina is regarded as one of the most reliable biometric modalities available in the marketplace nowadays. Since retinal recognition templates are incredibly small, it is quite fast to confirm the identity of a person. Once identity is verified through a retinal scan, there is almost no error given the high number of unique data points of the retina. Simply put, it is virtually impossible to be falsely accepted by a retinal recognition system.\n5. A retinal scan is performed by casting an unperceived beam of low-energy infrared light into a person\u2019s eye as they look through the scanner's eyepiece. This beam of light traces a standardized path on the retina. Because retinal blood vessels absorb light more readily than the surrounding tissue, the amount of reflection varies during the scan. The pattern of variations is digitized and stored in a database.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Stock markets allow individuals to participate in the success of corporations and thereby generate personal wealth. Low capital requirements and easy access to the financial markets make it possible for a large percentage of society to benefit from economic growth and prosper financially.\n2. The stock market serves two very important purposes. The first is to provide capital to companies that they can use to fund and expand their businesses. If a company issues one million shares of stock that initially sell for $10 a share, then that provides the company with $10 million of capital that it can use to grow its business (minus whatever fees the company pays for an investment bank to manage the stock offering). By offering stock shares instead of borrowing the capital needed for expansion, the company avoids incurring debt and paying interest charges on that debt.\n3. In summary, the stock market allows corporations and public investors to transfer capital and ownership in a secure and controlled environment. It is a convenient way for companies to raise capital and for individuals to buy, trade or cash out investments. Additionally, the stock market helps to keep corporate practices in check and fuels a nation\u2019s economic growth and individual prosperity.\n4. - Stock markets increase investments in the economy. The stock market is a tool for worldwide investors to participate in local economies. Promising, well run economies attract capital investments which allow companies to further innovate and invest.

I have a friend who has someone asking him to accept a personal check for mobile deposit but the check he is supposed to take the photo of, it isn\u2019t an actual photo but rather a scanned copy. I haven\u2019t had to provide any personal or financial information and I don\u2019t think my banking app will accept it but I feel like I should keep my guard up. Is it possible for them to gain access to my account in such a manner?\n2. Whether you deposit a check into a bank account from an ATM, in-branch with a teller, or from a mobile deposit capture, the process for clearing and check acceptance is generally the same. Because paper checks have no actual monetary value themselves, banks have to verify whether the transaction can actually be completed or not. When the check is captured, financial institutions use a variety of data points to make a judgment about the validity of the check. The data they acquire needs to answer questions like, is the account of the check issuer in good standing? Are there enough funds in their account? Is the check a high dollar amount?\n3. - A new federal law known as the \"Check 21 Act\" makes it easier for banks to create and send electronic images of paper checks. Even before Check 21, banks were allowed to process checks electronically when all the banks in the process agreed. Under Check 21, any bank may create a special paper copy\u2014called a \"substitute check\"\u2014using images of the front and back of an original check. If any bank in the process requires a paper check, another bank can send a substitute check in place of the original.\n4. If you\u2019re holding onto a check that\u2019s suspect, you can try to verify funds in the account. To do so, contact the bank that the check is drawn on and ask to verify funds. Some banks, in the interest of privacy, will only tell you whether or not the account is valid, or they will not provide any information at all.\n5. It\u2019s possible to verify a check before you try to deposit it at your bank, and it\u2019s wise to do so with any checks you have doubts about\u2014especially large ones. You'll want to make sure a check is valid and the writer has sufficient funds available before you deposit it, or else it can bounce.

The object-oriented programming is basically a computer programming design philosophy or methodology that organizes/ models software design around data, or objects rather than functions and logic.\n2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach identifies classes of objects that are closely related to the methods with which they are associated. It also covers the concepts of attribute and method inheritance. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the first institution to utilize terminology referring to \u201cobjects\u201d in the sense that we use object-oriented programming today, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n3. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages, including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.\n5. As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. See, there\u2019s a thing in the NFL called an \u201cinjury settlement,\u201d whereby if a player gets injured during the preseason, and the team wants to get rid of that player, they have to cover his medical costs and salary for the weeks he\u2019s predicted to be injured in a one-time payout. This amount can be in the thousands, if not the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and, well, NFL teams don\u2019t like parting with their money.\n2. The norm for NFL players are provisions that allow a team to cut a player at the beginning of the next year. So, the usual rule is that a player will always get paid for the current season, even if they do not play at all, but if they are unable to play due to an injury then the team can release them and terminate the contract the next year, as long as they decide to do so by a particular date, which is usually in March. Note that if a player cannot play due to injury, usually they get paid injury pay which is less than their full pay, but is still a substantial.\n3. Farmer: An injured player gets paid for as long as he\u2019s unable to play, no matter what his contract says. A team can\u2019t release an injured player until he\u2019s cleared. For most rookie contracts, players selected in the third round or later, there\u2019s something called an \u201cup-down,\u201d which is two minimum salaries negotiated in the collective bargaining agreement. The \u201cup\u201d is the minimum active salary, which this season is $420,000, and the \u201cdown\u201d ($303,000) is the minimum inactive salary. If a player is injured after eight games, he\u2019s paid eight weeks \u201cup\u201d and nine weeks \u201cdown\u201d (eight weeks, plus the bye). For most veterans, there is no \u201cdown.\u201d It\u2019s whatever he\u2019s scheduled to earn. If a player gets hurt doing a football-related activity, he\u2019s covered, no matter when it happens. So if he tears his anterior cruciate ligament in a May minicamp, he\u2019s covered.\n4. There are also injury settlements, which must be agreed to within five days of a player being placed on injured reserve. Say a player suffers a sprained ankle in training camp and it\u2019s a three-week injury. The team can pay him for those three weeks, then release him. That player is eligible to return to that team after the number of weeks the settlement was for (in this case, three), plus another six weeks. So he would be eligible to return in any capacity by Week 10. That six-week \u201ctax\u201d is put in place so teams can\u2019t stash players by saying they\u2019re injured. If a player suffers an injury doing something unrelated to football, he\u2019s placed on the reserve/non-football injury list. It\u2019s at the discretion of the team whether the player is paid.\n5. If a player has an injury guarantee in his contract, that player will get paid his money. Let's say a player signs a five-year deal and has injury guarantees for the first three seasons. These guarantees state that said player will get his entire salary even if he is injured at any point in the first three years.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Natural diamonds offer many advantages you cannot get from other gems, not even from lab-grown diamonds. These synthetic diamonds may have the same molecular makeup and look precisely like natural diamonds (they can even look pristine and flawless, just like natural diamonds), but the similarities end there.\n2. The difference is due to supply. Natural diamond supply is limited, due to the billions of years it takes for nature to create a diamond. Yet with synthetic diamonds, there is no cap on the supply, which drives the price lower and lower as supply goes up.\n3. These questions are somewhat misleading. This is because they are based upon the assumption that there is a significant difference between lab created diamonds vs. natural or real diamonds.

Another key difference between how white and American cheese are made has to do with the milk. When making yellow American cheese, the milk has been drained longer. This means that more butterfat is left for the cheese.\n2. Clearly, white and yellow American cheese are different colors. As we shared above, the color is the result of the production process. White American cheese is white because of the citric acid that is used to treat the milk, and yellow American cheese is yellow due to the beta-carotene that drains out of the whey.\n3. They are both made from animal milk by the coagulation method. White and yellow American cheese is generally sold in many forms along the lines of wrapped slices (so they are commonly called \u201csingles\u201d), shredded cubes, solid blocks, spread, etc.\n4. However, a key difference between the two cheeses is that yellow American cheese has a higher fat content. Remember, when making yellow American cheese, the curds drain for a longer amount of time. This results in the cheese having a higher percentage of fat.\n5. White and yellow American cheese are similar but not exactly the same thing. Yellow cheese has a higher fat content, which accounts for a softer texture and richer flavor, while white cheese is drier and more crumbly. Yellow cheese tends to have a sharper tangy flavor, while white cheese is milder.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

One of the earliest civilizations to adopt last names was China. Over three thousand years ago, people there supposedly adopted family names as last names to enhance their census.\n2. Over time, though, these villages and populations grew. People traveled more. They traded with other places. Soon, they needed a way to tell the difference between people with the same name. Last names started as a way to separate one \u201cJohn\u201d from another \u201cJohn.\u201d\n3. After the end of slavery, previously enslaved people chose their own last names. Some took the names of their former owners. Others took on the family names of important figures in American history or chose entirely new last names. Today, some people still choose their own last names. They do so to make their names fit their personalities or beliefs.\n4. European cultures began to see a growth in the use of last names around 1100 CE (also known as AD), with most of Europeans families having last names by the end of the 1400s. However, Europe, like everywhere else, is made up of many different cultures with diverse traditions.\n5. In England, the Normans introduced surnames after 1066. At first, names were frequently changed or dropped, but eventually they began to stick and were passed down in a family \u2014 by the aristocracy to start with and eventually by the rest of the people. By 1400, most English families, and also those of lowland Scotland, were using surnames that were hereditary. Wives took the husband\u2019s last name, and King Henry VII (1491-1547) ordered that children\u2019s names be recorded under the father\u2019s last name.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

So there you have it, no, the fish generally don't die en mass when lightning strikes. Lightning striking the ocean is quickly dissipated across the surface, but if you happen to be swimming about with a nice big steel conductor tied to your back like a scuba diver, you could well up your odds of being hit and in for a rough day. But still, it's way safer to be in the sea than playing a round of golf.\n2. On land, the impact of a lightning strike tends to be vertical, with each bolt striking its target and heading in a downwards direction. Water, however, acts as a strong conductor of electricity and behaves differently to solid materials. On hitting the water, lightning spreads horizontally: it\u2019s not just what\u2019s at the point of impact that\u2019s at risk but anything that finds itself in the surrounding areas too. Fish, boats, swimmers, divers \u2013 they can all be impacted.\n3. So in the unusual event that lightning does in fact strike the sea, do fish get electrocuted? Apparently not, unlike air, the sea is a very good conductor as it contains salt. Rather than creating an direct narrow, path concentrating the \"punch\", the charge from the lightning strike spreads out sideways and downwards in an expanding half sphere from the surface. Any fish within a few meters of the strike area would probably be killed but beyond that they would probably just feel a tingle. Fish also tend to be a bit deeper in the water and not at the surface where the current is concentrated. So again, the odds are well stacked in favor of the fish. So technically yes, if the fish is right there in the immediate area of the strike and in shallow water, the fish probably will be electrocuted, but only fish in a very small area near the surface. Glad we got that part of it answered.\n4. Water and lightning are a natural combination. Water conducts electricity very well, and when you add in the high profile of a boat surrounded by open water, there is an increased danger of getting electrocuted during a storm.\n5. It tends to be objects or living creatures at the surface of the water that are most likely to be affected: generally, fish will not be killed by lightning strikes as they tend to swim deeper than surface level. Swimmers, paddle boarders and surfers, however, can act as the point of least resistance for a lightning bolt \u2013 much like a person standing in the middle of an open space such as a field or a park. Diving down beneath the surface may prove a temporary solution but it\u2019s unlikely that a human would be able to dive deep enough or for long enough to avoid the potential danger.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Lowering public pensions' investment-return assumptions to more realistic levels and updating mortality will increase governments' pension debt. The next step in fixing public-pension funding is to determine how the debt will be paid down over time, or amortized. Most public pensions currently spread pension-debt payments over 30 years or more and backload those payments so that they get larger as payroll grows. The result is that government payments often do not reduce the initial pension debt much over the first 10 to 20 years of the payment schedule. And it is actually common for plans to build in periods of negative amortization, where the pension debt grows because expected payments are not large enough to cover the interest on the debt.\n2. The only way to ensure that pension costs and benefits are distributed equitably across generations of workers and taxpayers is to fully fund benefits as they are earned. And having a strong pension-funding policy is more important now than ever before because pensions are bigger and riskier now than ever before. As noted above, state and local public pensions are 47.5% funded at this point, but even that may be misleading. The last time pension funding was at roughly this level was 1983, when liabilities were approximately 18% of GDP. Today, liabilities are more than twice as large relative to GDP (42%). Because of pensions' increased scale, relatively small misses on the anticipated investment return or other assumptions (like mortality) would have outsized future budgetary implications. And because pension investment portfolios have gotten riskier, uncertainty about future returns has increased.\n3. Pension funds should be allowed to pursue their primary goal of ensuring retirement security for their beneficiaries. However, under certain circumstances\u2014such as a pandemic-induced crisis with rapidly escalating debt loads\u2014pension funds can play more of a command role as captive audiences. Yet this should only be done in exceptional circumstances and for a short period of time, preferably using public pension funds rather than individual pension accounts. If done in a targeted way, using pension funds for financial repression can result in citizens benefiting in economic growth and recovery over the long term in return for a short-term reduction in investment returns. At worst, this policy depletes pension savings without delivering welfare gains. We hope that our four core principles will help governments opting for this mechanism to have the best chance of positive results.\n4. Unfortunately, the majority of public pensions have been far too slow to adapt, and as a result have seen their funded ratios consistently deteriorate. Many governments face daunting amounts of pension debt that can make full funding appear out of reach. Fixing public-pension funding is not technically difficult, but in most jurisdictions, fully funding pensions at this point would require significantly higher contributions or reduced benefits (or both), making a solution politically challenging to achieve. However, failing to take meaningful action to close the funding gap will only make the problem more challenging and painful to fix in the future. No matter the scale of the problem, governments that work with their plans to craft workable solutions and begin down the path to full funding will be better positioned to weather the next downturn.\n5. The upshot of this history is that public pensions are bigger and riskier than ever. Pension liabilities and debt have never been so large relative to taxpayers' capacity to pay, and pension investments have never been so uncertain. Public pensions' finances have continued to deteriorate despite a decade-long bull market that has seen the S&P 500 index grow by more than 300% from its bottom in 2009. It's clear that pension plans are not simply going to grow their way back to fiscal health, and that more must be done to reverse the deleterious effects of rising pension debt.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

MSA long vowels are represented by the first three letters below. Short vowels or absence of a vowel are represented by diacritics as shown by the following four letters. Diacritics are used only in the Qur\u2019an, religious texts, classical poetry, children\u2019s books, and textbooks for learners of Arabic.\n4. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA hereinafter) verb roots are represented by the consonants found in the word. The basic and most common form of MSA verbs is C1C2C3, where C is a placeholder for MSA root consonants. Once root consonants are chosen and placed in the appropriate pattern, Vowels are inserted, adding morphological information.\n5. Although there are relatively few distinct vowels in Arabic, the quality of their pronunciation does admit of a considerable amount of variation, especially in the case of the \u201ca\u201d sound. One significant factor is the proximity of one or more of the emphatic consonants (\u0638 ,\u0637 ,\u0636 ,\u0635) or \u0642, which has the effect of deepening the surrounding vowel sounds. Pronunciation of vowels can also vary from one dialect region to another, and this can affect vowel quality even in MSA. These variations are not generally of any semantic significance, however. They are what linguists call allophones, i.e. different sounds which may be used interchangeably without changing the meaning of a word, as opposed to phonemes, which are the most basic units of sound capable of producing a distinctive meaning.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Substituting meat for tofu can easily result in a loss of fat and calories in your diet. Additionally, tofu's high protein content allows you to repair muscles after exercise, rather than having them broken down to be used for fuel.\n3. While there may be some variation in the nutrient content of fresh versus packaged tofu\u2014omega-3 fatty acids, for instance, can degrade with exposure to light and air\u2014the quantity and quality of amino acids should be the same. Using soy products as a source of protein lets you reduce your intake of meat, which may well confer a net health benefit\u2014especially if the meat being replaced is high in saturated fat.\n4. Tofu has become a rising star in the meat substitute world, especially because it is full of protein. 3oz of tofu is comprised of about 18% protein while skinless roast chicken comes in at approximately 46%.

Some airports seem to have the planes always turning, while others seem to let them fly straight ahead as they climb. There must be a reason why some turn and some don\u2019t!\n3. Airplanes often turn to change direction. There are many different forces, however, acting against airplanes. Along with gravity, there\u2019s drag, lift and thrust, all of which can affect an airplane\u2019s trajectory. Airplanes can still turn when flying. They are designed with several components that allow for midair turning. How do airplanes turn when flying exactly?\n4. Airplanes may begin turning immediately after takeoff to reduce noise over urban areas, to avoid high terrain and storm cells, at the request of air traffic control, or to turn & get established on course as soon as possible. Most busy airports will have departure routes to help with traffic flow.\n5. To turn a plane, the pilot uses all three primary flight controls to move the airplane around its three axes. The airplane must be rolled into the turn, the nose yawed into it, and pitched up to maintain altitude.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Recent estimates suggest that as much as $36 billion a year in taxes are unpaid by Americans hiding wealth abroad, and more than $50 billion more is lost due to corporations shifting taxable profits offshore. To tackle this thorny problem, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides about $80 billion to the IRS for greater tax enforcement, expressly targeting the top \u201c1 percent\u201d of high-income, high-wealth individuals.\n2. When sophisticated high-income and corporate taxpayers are able to evade or aggressively dodge taxes due to nonenforcement, it undermines the fairness and integrity of the tax system\u2014to the disadvantage of the honest businesses and families who pay what they owe. It also worsens inequality along class and racial lines43 and drains enormous amounts of revenue from the Treasury.\n3. \"By beefing up the IRS's capacity to go after wealthy tax cheats, you're going to be able to collect at least $400 billion of that over the course of the next ten years, and I suspect substantially more,\" said Natasha Sarin, a counselor for tax policy and implementation at the Treasury Department.\n4. New research indicates that the United States loses at least $175 billion per year to tax noncompliance by the richest 1 percent, largely because of offshore evasion and underreported income from pass-through business entities.40 IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig has also identified the emergence of cryptocurrencies as a growing tax compliance problem.41 In its most recent analysis, the IRS estimated the net corporate tax gap to have been $32 billion per year from 2011 to 2013\u2014but it has likely grown since then, and tens of billions more are lost to profit shifting and other aggressive avoidance techniques that are not criminal but often go unchallenged because the IRS is vastly outgunned in audits of and litigation against large corporations.42\n5. Our new paper, \u201cDifferent From You and Me: Tax Enforcement and Sophisticated Tax Evasion by the Wealthy,\u201d reviews recent research showing that tax evasion and legally dubious forms of tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and large corporations represent an important and pressing challenge for the IRS, which needs more funding, not less, to tackle this problem. The research shows that the wealthy are adept at using sophisticated tactics to reduce their tax bills, but we argue that the IRS has tools at its disposal to combat this problem. Investing in tax enforcement targeting the high-wealth population could make taxes in the United States more progressive, raise revenues to fund vital public programs, and restore public confidence in the U.S. tax system.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Let\u2019s discuss each of these three methods and what they mean for investors.\n2.

Sometimes a bidder may try to buy a significant percentage of shares of the target company on the open market, hoping to gain enough voting power to persuade the board of directors to accept a takeover offer.

Originally, the Tor network was developed by the U.S. Navy to enable anonymous online communication for military organizations. In 2006, the military dropped the project, which has since been handled by a non-profit.\n2. The Tor network was primarily designed to provide a suitable tool for anonymous communication to vulnerable people on the internet. Such people include users in totalitarian and authoritarian countries, politically persecuted minorities, and journalists who want to protect their sources.\n3. Other groups can also benefit from this network, including IT professionals, business executives, bloggers, and law enforcement agents. Tor\u2019s law enforcement users include police officers, who may want to hide their IP addresses when they are undercover online and investigating dubious websites and services.\n4. Tor\u2014short for the Onion Routing project\u2014is an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The worldwide Tor computer network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users' online privacy is protected. Tor users' digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion.\n5. While most people associate Tor with illegal dealings, like accessing online drug markets, many people use the network for legitimate purposes.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. The key difference between unemployment and underemployment is that unemployment refers to the economic situation in which an individual who is actively searching for employment is unable to find work whereas underemployment is a situation where there is a mismatch between the employment opportunities and the skills and education level of the employees. Both unemployment and underemployment result in adverse economic conditions of a country and should be managed effectively in order to reduce and control its negative effects. Thus, the government has a major role to play in policy formation in order to retain skilled employees.\n2. The U.S. unemployment rate was 13.3% as of May 2020, but at the same time, the U.S. underemployment rate was 22.8%. The unemployment rate is defined by the BLS as including \"as a percentage of the labor force (the labor force is the sum of the employed and unemployed).\" A measure of underemployment is needed to express the opportunity cost of advanced skills not being used or being underutilized.\n3. The difference between unemployment and underemployment can be explained as the economic situation in which an individual who is actively searching for employment is unable to find work (unemployment) and a situation where individuals do not utilize their skills and education optimally in their jobs (underemployment). Employment opportunities are generally low in developing nations thus many individuals migrate to developed nations in search of favorable employment conditions. Government policies should be in place to ensure that the country\u2019s individuals are employed as well as they are employed in jobs that enable them to utilize their education, skills, and ability to work to produce economic output.\n4. Underemployment is an often misunderstood part of the economy. Unemployment is a term that refers to the number of people who want a job and do not have one. Underemployment represents people who are working but are not working in a job that matches their skills or abilities, often leading to earning less than what he or she should earn. When a person cannot find a job that matches their availability, skills, and experience, that is called underemployment. When considering who has a job and how many people are without one, it\u2019s critical to understand the full picture.\n5. Underemployment as well as unemployment is counted in U.S. government reports in order to provide a truer picture of the health of the job market.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

As long as the wound is cleaned daily, it is not necessary to use an antibiotic ointment.\n3. The main role of antibiotics in wound healing is inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant bacteria and promoting healing in a rodent wound model65. Both amoxicillin and doxycycline fulfil these roles as broad-spectrum and bactericidal antibiotics that help prevent bacterial growth and help ulcers and wounds heal within a short period. Thus, the nanoparticles implemented in this study exhibited much higher antibacterial potency against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as they increased the penetration power into the bacterial cell wall or membrane. The enhanced inhibitory effect compared with that of the normal antibiotic alone was due to the ability of the designed nanoparticles to disintegrate the bacterial membrane. These nanoparticles accelerated the healing of ulcers and wounds by regulating inflammation and angiogenesis. In addition, they allowed for an increase in the skin absorptivity of the nanoscale mixture.\n4.

Abrasions like road rash are loaded with dirt from whatever surface it was that you dragged yourself across.

In the last few years it has been discovered that there are a number of different ways of making the same artificial flavor. Chemical A and Chemical B are combined, and peppermint flavor appears. Another researcher tries putting Chemical C and Chemical D together - and peppermint is there again. Even more surprising, every so often a chemist makes up an imitation flavor that tastes exactly like the real thing, and discovers that it does not contain the chemical compounds so painstakingly discovered in the laboratory analysis of the natural product. Some of the chemicals used to make good imitation peach and strawberry flavors, for example, have not been found in the true fruit extracts, and yet they give the same effect. This is one of the mysteries still to be solved by the scientist.\n2. What\u2019s interesting is that we don\u2019t need all the flavor compounds in a given food to re-create its flavor. For instance, an orange contains 250 flavor chemicals, which all combine to create an orange flavor. But artificially flavored Tang, a powdered drink mix, contains only six aromatic chemicals, yet it has an orange-like taste. So, we can re-create a good orange flavor by combining only a handful of the most abundant or most strongly flavored compounds present in an orange.\n3. Chemists create artificial flavors from the chemical compounds present in plants and animals. They use them in their natural state, or they process them to make new flavors. They also create concentrates by extracting the juice of fruits, such as oranges and lemons. They remove the water from the juice, and the concentrated orange or lemon juice goes into cans. You can later add water to reconstitute the juice.\n4. As new aromatic chemicals were synthesized and combined, it produced an expanding list of artificial fruit flavors. \u201cArtificial essences of nearly every fruit are made,\u201d wrote one commentator in 1864, \u201csome of which are absolutely perfect in their resemblance to the real fruit essence, while others leave a great deal to the imagination.\u201d\n5.

Ernest Hilgard, who developed the \"neodissociation\" theory of hypnotism, hypothesised that hypnosis causes the subjects to divide their consciousness voluntarily. One part responds to the hypnotist while the other retains awareness of reality. Hilgard made subjects take an ice water bath. None mentioned the water being cold or feeling pain. Hilgard then asked the subjects to lift their index finger if they felt pain and 70% of the subjects lifted their index finger. This showed that, even though the subjects were listening to the suggestive hypnotist, they still sensed the water's temperature.\n2. 1. Janet, near the turn of the century, and more recently Ernest Hilgard ..., have defined hypnosis in terms of dissociation.\n3. (Definition of hypnotism from the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary \u00a9 Cambridge University Press)\n4. The words hypnosis and hypnotism both derive from the term neuro-hypnotism (nervous sleep), all of which were coined by \u00c9tienne F\u00e9lix d'Henin de Cuvillers in the 1820s. The term hypnosis is derived from the ancient Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 hypnos, \"sleep\", and the suffix -\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 -osis, or from \u1f51\u03c0\u03bd\u03cc\u03c9 hypno\u014d, \"put to sleep\" (stem of aorist hypn\u014ds-) and the suffix -is. These words were popularised in English by the Scottish surgeon James Braid (to whom they are sometimes wrongly attributed) around 1841. Braid based his practice on that developed by Franz Mesmer and his followers (which was called \"Mesmerism\" or \"animal magnetism\"), but differed in his theory as to how the procedure worked.\n5. 145. ^ Meyerson J, Uziel N (2014). \"Application of hypno-dissociative strategies during dental treatment of patients with severe dental phobia\".

Running on the treadmill can feel progressively harder over time, even when sticking with the same pace. That could be because running at the exact same speed for however many minutes is more taxing on the body than the natural speeding up and slowing down we do on the roads based on hills and other variables.\n2. Philip Riches, a Scottish expert on biomechanics, conducted research and discovered that running on a treadmill with no incline causes the exerciser to run with their knees very straight, rather than naturally soft and slightly bent. This motion can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet. The knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight. He recommends using a treadmill with no motor for a more natural running experience.\n3. If you spend any time running on the treadmill, you should consider your perceived exertion and your breathing rate instead of focusing just on your minutes per mile. That way you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re underperforming just because your pace is a bit slower than outside. And if you\u2019re one of the lucky ones who feels the treadmill is easier, then you can pick up the pace inside to match your level of effort outside.\n4. In particular, if you find yourself with tired and heavy legs when running but you\u2019re not out of breath, or you feel that you could run further but your legs are aching too much, overtraining is a very common cause. This is due to the fact that your joints and bones strengthen at a slower rate than your cardio fitness improves.\n5. But the boring atmosphere, could also be an opportunity to grow as a runner if you choose to lean into the monotony.

The small intestine contains a trace amount of microorganisms due to the proximity and influence of the stomach. Gram-positive cocci and rod-shaped bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in the small intestine. However, in the distal portion of the small intestine alkaline conditions support gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial flora of the small intestine aid in a wide range of intestinal functions. The bacterial flora provide regulatory signals that enable the development and utility of the gut. Overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine can lead to intestinal failure. In addition the large intestine contains the largest bacterial ecosystem in the human body. About 99% of the large intestine and feces flora are made up of obligate anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Factors that disrupt the microorganism population of the large intestine include antibiotics, stress, and parasites.\n2. The microbial composition of the gut microbiota varies across the digestive tract. In the stomach and small intestine, relatively few species of bacteria are generally present. The colon, in contrast, contains the highest microbial density recorded in any habitat on Earth with up to 1012 cells per gram of intestinal content. These bacteria represent between 300 and 1000 different species. However, 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species. As a consequence of their abundance in the intestine, bacteria also make up to 60% of the dry mass of feces. Fungi, protists, archaea, and viruses are also present in the gut flora, but less is known about their activities.\n3. Five phyla dominate the intestinal microbiota: Bacteroidota, Bacillota (Firmicutes), Actinomycetota, Pseudomonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota\u2014with Bacteroidota and Bacillota constituting 90% of the composition. Somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut, with most estimates at about 500. However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species, with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (phylum firmicutes) being the most common species in healthy adults.\n4. Researchers have known for some time that humans and the other great apes harbor many types of bacteria, especially in their guts, a collection known as the microbiome. But where did these microbes come from: our ancient ancestors, or our environment? A study of fecal bacteria across all mammals suggested that the microbes are more likely to be inherited than acquired from the environment. But other studies have found that diet plays a major role in shaping the bacteria in our guts.\n5. Bacteria make up most of the flora in the colon and 60% of the dry mass of feces. This fact makes feces an ideal source of gut flora for any tests and experiments by extracting the nucleic acid from fecal specimens, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences are generated with bacterial primers. This form of testing is also often preferable to more invasive techniques, such as biopsies.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

According to a recent \u2018Ask Umbra\u2019 column on Grist, there are three factors affecting nutrient loss when you cook vegetables: temperature, time, and water. \u201cNutrients tend to be both heat-intolerant and water-soluble,\u201d the article says, which means that any method that requires a) cooking at a high temperature for a long time, and b) uses a lot of water will result in the greatest nutrient loss. (So by this measure, boiling vegetables is likely the worst offender.) It goes without saying then that cooking at a lower temperature for a shorter amount of time and with less water would result in the least amount of nutrients lost, and that\u2019s what the microwave accomplishes.\n4. Unfortunately, the reheated remnants don\u2019t always live up to your expectations, particularly when microwaved. And if you think the microwave only affects the texture of your food, you\u2019re wrong. Microwaves are notorious for making food taste like plastic or cardboard.\n5. However, you don\u2019t experience this using a microwave. Due to its rapid cooking method and high temperatures, the molecular structures of foods are easily ruptured. What happens next is that some of the food compounds, such as protein, break down, releasing iron which gives off bad smells.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Obviously, fatigue is the number one cause for developing dark circles under your eyes, leaving you with that easily-recognisable \u201cI didn\u2019t get enough sleep last night\u201d look. This is because a lack of sleep allows fluid to build below your eyes, creating a puffy look underneath the thin under-eye skin. As the skin under your eyes is so delicate and thin, dark tissues and blood vessels are sometimes visible through it. These tissues swell when you haven\u2019t slept enough, meaning they show through the skin even more. The blood vessels under your eyes also become more visible with age, so the older you get, the more you might start to notice your under-eye dark circles.\n2. Dark circles often develop when you haven\u2019t slept in a while. Lack of sleep can also cause puffiness, or \u201ceye bags,\u201d under your eyes. Allergies are another common cause of dark circles. Others include trauma to the eye, low thyroid levels, and loose skin around the eyes.\n3. Not getting enough sleep is one of the most common causes of dark circles under your eyes, explains Dr. Chris Winter, sleep neurologist and Sleep.com and Mattress Firm Sleep Advisor. How does lack of sleep cause these dark circles exactly? \u201cWhen an individual does not sleep enough, it creates vasodilatation and increased blood flow,\u201d Winter explains. \u201cWhen the vessels under the eyes dilate, it creates the dark bluish color under the eyes.\u201d\n4. Oversleeping, extreme fatigue, or just staying up a few hours past your typical bedtime can cause dark circles to form under your eyes. Sleep deprivation can cause your skin to become dull and paler. The dark tissues and blood vessels beneath your skin can start to show.\n5. Too little sleep isn\u2019t the only cause of dark circles under the eyes. Other possible causes include aging, allergies, and genetics. You can reduce the appearance of dark circles with home remedies or permanent medical treatments.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

If these cities are spending millions on giant mirrors, you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty buying yourself a happy lamp. Darkness affects the mood and stamina of all humans because our biology involved alongside light. As such, light plays a big role in driving our desire to sleep \u2014 and in the darkest parts of the world, that drive is intensified.\n2. It\u2019s that time of the year when it\u2019s dark in the morning when you get up and dark when you\u2019re done with the work day. Plus, for many, winter means gray days and little sunshine between the darkness. This lack of light affects sleep and can have a noticeable impact on your energy, motivation, appetite, and overall mental state. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is very real for those unfortunate enough to suffer from it and can lead to more prolonged periods of depression. One way to stay ahead of the winter blues is to get better sleep with a regular sleep schedule. The goal is to maintain a consistent sleep routine despite the shorter days. The desire to sleep your way through the day or nap through the late afternoon because of the darkness is considered poor sleep hygiene and could actually make you feel worse.\n3. On gloomy days, another melatonin-linked issue arises: Light typically suppresses melatonin production, but when the skies are consistently gray, there\u2019s nothing to override production, so it keeps getting pumped out. This disrupts the body\u2019s circadian rhythms, and the confusion causes daytime sleepiness.\n4. When it\u2019s dark, the body releases a hormone called melatonin from the brain\u2019s pineal gland, signaling that it\u2019s time to feel drowsy (for this reason, melatonin supplements are often sold as a sleep aid). Because light impedes the rate of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland, melatonin production increases at night. But during an especially dark winter, the body gets confused, producing melatonin as those 5:30 pm sunsets hit \u2014 much earlier than normal. That\u2019s how you end up in sweatpants by seven.\n5. Figure 1. When a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus does not detect light, the pineal gland is free to produce melatonin, which makes us feel drowsy.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Nothing is more frustrating than inserting a quarter into a vending machine to get a delicious snack, only for the machine to spit it right back.

Humans and all other living things have DNA, which contains hereditary information. The information in your DNA gives your cells instructions for producing proteins. Proteins drive important body functions, like digesting food, building cells, and moving your muscles.\n2. More than 98 percent of our genome is noncoding DNA\u2014DNA that doesn't contain information to make proteins. As it turns out, some of this \"junk DNA\" has other jobs. So far, scientists have learned that it can help organize the DNA within the nucleus and help turn on or off the genes that do code for proteins.\n3. However, DNA does more than specify the structure and function of living things \u2014 it also serves as the primary unit of heredity in organisms of all types. In other words, whenever organisms reproduce, a portion of their DNA is passed along to their offspring. This transmission of all or part of an organism's DNA helps ensure a certain level of continuity from one generation to the next, while still allowing for slight changes that contribute to the diversity of life.\n4. Because a person\u2019s DNA must be exactly the same across all the body\u2019s cells, DNA has the fascinating ability to make copies of itself. This is how it stores genetic information and ensures that when a cell divides, the new cells contain exact replicas of the DNA from the original cell.\n5.

Hammers to the left and right push the link and 2 copper blocks are placed on top of the link, transmitting electric current to it. current flows through the gap in the link as hammers push it to close. Thus it reaches 997\u00baC, it melts and welds.\n2. So while the world technically had welding, its uses were limited to small workpieces that could be moved to and from a blacksmith. Large projects like buildings, ships and primitive machinery were mostly still made of wood and stone. At around 3000 BC, the Egyptians learned how to use wooden rivets to attach large plates of material together. However, their wooden rivets proved unreliable for holding any type of metal together.\n3. The chain then passes to the welder where each link is machine welded electrically with no filler by heating the edges of the wire ends and forging them together. The excess material is trimmed.\n4. The very first chains were made in England by blacksmiths. The process developed in this time was used well into the 19th century until it became obsolete. Steel manufacturing and processing problems hindered chain manufacturing growth until this time as well. Growth was spurred once again once molded chain was invented, further progressing the chain industry. This opened the door for the manufacturing of several different types of chain including steel detachable chain.\n5. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint when we started manufacturing large metal structures. Around the late 1700s and early 1800s, multiple industries began attaching large metal plates together. Since our idea of modern (portable) welding machines didn\u2019t make an appearance until the late 1800s, these large metal sheets were usually held together by rivets. For instance, French shipbuilders in the 1830s began experimenting by armoring their wooden vessels with sheets of metal. These metal sheets would either be riveted or attached in a similar way to the wooden outer planks of the ship. These were called \u201cironclad\u201d ships. When this concept proved successful, ship builders began totally removing the wooden parts. Instead, they would overlap metal plates and rivet them together. Here\u2019s really the first time in history we see large metal projects being created.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This exothermic reaction yields 232 kJ/mol of water formed. The rapid release of a considerable amount of energy causes the surrounding air to expand suddenly, resulting in a sharp expolsion. When pure hydrogen is ignited, the reaction with the surrounding air is less rapid, the sound is less loud, and a significantly larger flame is produced. The comparatively mild sounds emitted when the helium balloons are ignited are caused by the rupturing of the balloons and the escape of the gas. The explosions are caused by a sudden pressure effect through the action of heat on produced or adjacent gases.\n3. For the first time, the explosion of microbubbles was observed by Postnikov et al. . In this study, due to the use of thin film Ti electrodes, it was possible to produce more powerful explosions and investigate the dynamics of the process in more detail. Moreover, here, the exploding bubble was observed from the side for the first time. It demonstrates that, during the expanding and shrinking phases, the bubble exists in the form of a hemisphere attached to the substrate.\n4. In the case of beer, cavitation creates large bubbles, which rapidly collapse. The collapse of these \"mother\" bubbles creates multiple, smaller \"daughter\" bubbles.\n5. This train of waves causes a big mess. In response to the compression and expansion forces pushing and pulling it every which way, the beer undergoes cavitation, or forms bubbles. Cavitation occurs in response to rapid pressure changes in a liquid, and is important in the engineering of ship propellers. Since these propellers cause cavitation as they spin, the formation and collapse of the bubbles puts chronic stress on the metal.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This is why you see such sentences as \u201cThis is a work of fiction, and any resemblance to a real person or persons is entirely coincidental.\u201d The sentence may in fact be total bullshit, but it\u2019s there for the writer's protection. It\u2019s a preemptive strike. Don\u2019t leave it out.\n3. 4. Disclaimers can't hurt. You will frequently see in the front matter of novels a statement such as: \"This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents are the products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events, locales, or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.\" A disclaimer won't really protect you if there is evidence that the similarities are not \"entirely coincidental.\" Nevertheless, a disclaimer gives a lawyer defending you something specific to point to in order to underscore to the court that \"this work is presented to the world as 'fiction' not as a factual account.\" And, remember, under the law, a reasonable reader would have to understand a statement about a person as a \"false and defamatory\" statement of fact for it to be libelous.\n4. \"When an author wants to draw from a real person as the basis for a fictional character, there are two relatively \"safe\" courses of action from a legal perspective: First, the author may make little or no attempt to disguise the character, but refrain from any defamatory and false embellishments on the character's conduct or personality; second, the author may engage in creative embellishments that reflect negatively on the character's reputation, but make substantial efforts to disguise the character . . . to avoid identification. When an author takes a middle ground, however, neither adhering perfectly to the person's attributes and behavior nor engaging in elaborate disguise, there is a threat of defamation liability.\"\n5. Wow, this is a tough one. Adding the \"this is a work of fiction... coincidental\" line strikes me as useless if you know for a fact that the resemblences are on purpose. Getting waivers from family members is not a bad idea, but if you're writing about other people negatively - especially if you're depicting them doing something illegal - is a recipe for a law suit if they feel like you've violated their privacy. I'd be very careful here. To me, the best thing you can do is fictionalize everybody beyond recognition. If he's tall and blond, make him short and bald; if she's fat, make her thin.

However, it doesn\u2019t have any living cells and is unable to repair itself if it undergoes physical or chemical damage. This means that enamel erosion isn\u2019t reversible, and the enamel won\u2019t grow back.\n2. As incredible as it is, enamel is not a living tissue. At the time of this writing, it cannot be naturally regenerated outside of laboratory conditions. No toothpaste, mouthwash, gooey paste or vitamin supplement can cause worn enamel to strengthen itself.\n3. The human body\u2019s pretty amazing: Broken skin heals; cut nails and hair grow back again; fractured bones knit together. But as amazing as the body's ability to repair itself may be, it can\u2019t regrow tooth enamel. Ever.\n4. When a tooth suffers damage, it loses something called dentin\u2014the hard, bony tissue underneath the enamel that forms the bulk of the tooth. Each tooth\u2019s stem cells produce new dentin, in an attempt to repair the damage. However, this innate repair mechanism has its limits and can only manufacture small amounts of tissue while combating a cavity, injury, or infection. This is why, under normal circumstances, teeth cannot heal themselves.\n5. Time, wear, and decay bore holes through a tooth\u2019s outer layers, resulting in cavities and other dental issues. Unlike a broken bone, enamel\u2019s defensive lining doesn\u2019t repair itself, explains Janet Moradian-Oldak, a biochemist and professor in the School of Dentistry at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Shorting a stock means opening a position by borrowing shares that you don't own and then selling them to another investor. Shorting, or selling short, is a bearish stock position -- in other words, you might short a stock if you feel strongly that its share price was going to decline.\n2. A \"short\" position is generally the sale of a stock you do not own. Investors who sell short believe the price of the stock will decrease in value. If the price drops, you can buy the stock at the lower price and make a profit. If the price of the stock rises and you buy it back later at the higher price, you will incur a loss. Short selling is for the experienced investor.\n3. Closing a short position means buying the stock in question \u2014 so if a group of short sellers gets spooked into closing their positions by a price increase, they will all buy the stock around the same time, which could further increase the price of the stock (and thus any remaining short sellers' losses).\n4. Short selling is a way to invest so that you can attempt to profit when the price of a security \u2014 such as a stock \u2014 declines. It\u2019s considered an advanced strategy that is probably best left to experienced investors and professional traders.\n5.

Even though sound may travel slower in cold air, it can travel further distances. This is because the sound wave is refracted away from the pockets of warm air and back towards the ground. This wave then oscillates between the cold air, warm air, and the surface, making it travel further.\n2. While maybe slower, sound can travel further distances when it is colder. The increase in range is caused by an inversion, which happens when warm air traps cold air near the ground. Instead of the sound wave being transmitted in a single direction, it is refracted away from the warmer air aloft and back towards the surface. The wave then oscillates between the interface of the colder air, the overlying warmer air, and the ground.

Antivirus software protects your device from viruses that can destroy your data, slow down or crash your device, or allow spammers to send email through your account. Antivirus protection scans your files and your incoming email for viruses, and then deletes anything malicious. You must keep your antivirus software updated to cope with the latest \"bugs\" circulating the internet. Most antivirus software includes a feature to download updates automatically when you are online. In addition, make sure that the software is continually running and checking your system for viruses, especially if you are downloading files from the web or checking your email. Set your antivirus software to check for viruses every day. You should also give your system a thorough scan at least twice a month.\n2. Antivirus is necessary even if you\u2019re on a Mac or Windows device, which both come with some level of virus protection built in. For total protection with endpoint protection and response, and blocks against malware and potentially unwanted programs, it\u2019s best to install a third-party antivirus software. The one exception is for iOS devices like iPhones and iPads, which don\u2019t require antivirus software. However, for Macs, Windows and Androids, antivirus software is a necessity, as new viruses are created every day.\n3. It\u2019s worth noting that some cheap (and free) antiviruses don\u2019t offer a decent level of protection, so while you may be saving money, you could put your devices at risk. That\u2019s why you should only choose a trusted low-cost antivirus that offers excellent security protections.\n4. But ultimately, relying on any one app to protect your system, data, and privacy is a bad bet, especially when almost every antivirus app has proven vulnerable on occasion. No antivirus tool, paid or free, can catch every malicious bit of software that arrives on your computer. You also need secure passwords, two-factor logins, data encryption, systemwide backups, automatic software updates, and smart privacy tools added to your browser. You need to be mindful of what you download and to download software only from official sources, such as the Microsoft App Store and Apple Mac App Store, whenever possible. You should avoid downloading and opening email attachments unless you know what they are. For guidance, check out our full guide to setting up all these security layers.\n5. - Easy-to-use. Whether you\u2019re an amateur or an expert, you need virus protection for your computers, your phones, and your tablets.

This can be set to display a 3x3, 6x4 or 3x3 and diagonal grid on the screen when the camera is in Live View mode, and in some DSLRs in the viewfinder. This is a helpful visual aid that makes it easier to align objects in the scene, avoid tilted horizons and create pleasing scenes conforming to the compositional principle known as the Rule of Thirds.\n2. Try this. Look at a distant scene and then quickly look at the rear screen LCD monitor and see how quickly your eye refocuses on it. Do you refocus instantly? Now try the same thing with a camera with an eyepiece. You might discover that your eyes focus more quickly and easily on the LCD screen than with the eyepiece. That\u2019s my experience and one of the reasons I use the LCD screen.\n3. Another advantage of the LCD monitor is its easy-to-see gridline screen display that is available on LCD monitors. This screen display is made up of two horizontal and two vertical lines that divide the frame into thirds. These third lines can be used as a guide for composing images. Placing people and things along the grid lines or at their intersections--instead of the dead center of the frame -- makes stronger images.\n4. Most modern smartphone cameras now can overlay the lines over the screen before taking the photo. These are referred to as either grids or gridlines - and they do not appear on the photo!\n5. The LCD screen works like the Leica glass viewfinder window because it doesn\u2019t limit my peripheral vision. I can see the monitor at the same time as I can see the world around it.

As marijuana has well-documented adverse health effects (discussed below), one of the principal questions permeating the legalization debate is whether liberalized marijuana laws will lead to increased prevalence of use. Generally, US states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana have higher rates of use than those where all forms of marijuana remain illegal (42\u201344). However, it is difficult to ascertain whether this is attributable to legalization or is associated with regional variation in permissive attitudes or perceived risk with regard to marijuana (43). Indeed, legal-marijuana states generally have higher rates of use even before legalization (42, 43).\n2. Ideological differences are evident within each party. About four-in-ten conservative Republicans (37%) say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use, compared with a 60% majority of moderate and liberal Republicans.\n3. Nearly two-thirds of conservative and moderate Democrats (63%) say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use. An overwhelming majority of liberal Democrats (84%) say the same.\n4. Liberal states that allow ballot petitions have largely voted to legalize marijuana, including California, Oregon and Massachusetts. \u201cNow, we\u2019re venturing into new, redder territory and what we\u2019re finding is voters are ready to approve these laws in those states,\u201d said Schweich, who, along with leading legalization campaigns in Maine, Massachusetts and Michigan, served as the co-director of the medical marijuana legalization campaign in Utah.\n5. Last month, voters in Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, D.C., added their states and cities to the list of those which have legalized marijuana for recreational use within their jurisdiction. Polls show significant increased support for marijuana legalization over the past decade, and many have posited that it is inevitable that state and federal policy will follow. Yet in a recent national poll conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove for Third Way, we found that topline trend obscures a more complicated truth.1 Most Americans do not view this issue as black and white\u2014in fact, there is a significant \u201cmarijuana middle\u201d who struggles with both sides of the legalization debate.
