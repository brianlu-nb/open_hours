One is that when running on a treadmill with no incline, the exerciser runs with their knees very straight, which can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet. The knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight[2]. Additionally, running on a treadmill with no motor allows for a more natural running experience[2]. Another reason is that the monotonous atmosphere of the treadmill can help build mental toughness and focus[5]. Finally, running on a treadmill can be an opportunity to improve cardio fitness, which can help with endurance, without overtraining the joints and bones, which strengthen at a slower rate than cardio fitness improves[4].
