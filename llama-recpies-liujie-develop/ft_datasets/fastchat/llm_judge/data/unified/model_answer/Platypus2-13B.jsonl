Please answer a question from a user.\n Below are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n 1. The copyright term is the length of time copyright subsists in a work before it passes into the public domain. In most of the world, this length of time is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years.\n\n 2. But is there a point to be made here? Are copyrights too long? At the outset, these arguments are based on a half-truth. The copyright term for an individual is indeed the life of the author plus 70 years after death. 7 Yet, the target of these arguments is uniformly the so called \u201cbig copyright\u201d players, namely the Hollywood motion picture and television studios and the music recording industry. These copyrights, being founded on the doctrine of \u201cwork made for hire\u201d last for a much more modest 95 years. 8 Still too much?\n\n 3. Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition or novel), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. In most countries (for example, the United States and the United Kingdom) copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in question.\n\n 4. When a person, typically the author, rightfully owns a copyright of a work, that right is not extinguished upon death. Instead, that right exists for an additional 70 years past the life of the author. If the owner of a copyright has a will, he can bequest his copyright to whoever he wants. If he dies without a will, his heirs at law will inherit the copyright.\n\n 5. If the new owner, the beneficiary of the copyright dies within those 70 years, the new owner may bequeath the copyright in a will, or her heirs at law will receive it upon her death. After the copyright term expires, the work enters the public domain, meaning that the copyright owner no longer retains any rights to the work. At that point, the intellectual property right can no longer be passed down. Hence why so many theater companies use Shakespeare\u2019s plays; his work is in the public domain. He has been dead since 1616, so there are no copyright protections. This means you do not need to pay royalties, making performance cheaper.\n\n --- information end ---\n\n When you respond, follow the following rules:\n 0.

Then Mrs. Thatcher came along and they decided to let the Chinese make them anyway.\nOf those that I've used personally - Soviet, Euro, Australian/NZ, and North American - I liked the southern one [wikipedia.org] most, strictly on the basis of convenience. It has 3 asymmetric pins, so you can grab it and plug it in correctly in one try without even looking at it, a feat I couldn't repeat with any other design. Plus, having a power switch on every plug is both handy and a good safety feature (and the switches normally also glow when turned on, so if you keep one that way you can find it in the dark).\nAnd since the pins are angled, even a two-pin version is pretty hard to accidentally wiggle free compared to the two round pin European plug (I think some European countries have extra bits as well that might help?). Definitely does not deserve comparison to the awful American plug design.\nThere's also a second reason British plugs are robust and fused: they're built to carry up to 3 kilowatts at 230 volts. (None of your wimpish American 110 volt mains juice here! Nothing quite makes your hair stand on end like accidentally touching a live pin carrying 230 volts and 13 amps ...)"]}], "tstamp": 1694287873.0478022}

Please answer a question from a user.\n Below are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n 1. While a wet nose is a healthy sign in your dog, a dry nose isn\u2019t necessarily cause for worry. Young dogs that love to lick are going to have wet noses, but as dogs age, their noses typically become a bit dryer. The dryness could also be a sign that your canine is dehydrated, Dr. Lands says, so be sure your dog gets plenty of water.\n 2. So although a wet nose is an indicator of good health, while a dry nose can mean the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s not always this clear. A healthy dog can have a dry or moist nose, but if they get ill can become too dry or too wet. Be on the lookout for changes like this as they can be great early warning signs your dog isn\u2019t quite tip-top. But just be sure to spot other changes too, as a dry or wet nose on its own doesn\u2019t indicate health on its own.\n 3. A very, very wet nose can also be a sign that your dog is sick. Dogs are like humans in that \u201cif we start to get some sort of infection in our nose or upper respiratory infection, our noses can become more moist and we can start getting some mucus buildup in our nose or coming out of our nostrils,\u201d Dr. Lands says.\n 4. Most often, a wet dog nose means they are healthy. However, a dry nose doesn\u2019t always point to a problem. The level of moisture and temperature of your dog\u2019s nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions. Sometimes, it can even fluctuate during a single day! Your pup may get a dry nose after a nap, or after intense playtime that left them dehydrated. The same is true for the temperature of your puppy's nose. Don\u2019t fret if you notice their nose is a bit warmer than usually, chances are it\u2019s just due to the weather.\n 5. The answer is: sometimes! A healthy dog\u2019s nose can be wet for various reasons that help with its functions. All noses secrete some mucus to trap anything that might damage the lungs \u2013 if this drips down, the clear fluid can moisten their nose. Dogs also lick their noses regularly which makes them wet \u2013 by doing this they carry some scent particles into their mouths which can then be sensed through a special organ called the vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson\u2019s organ, in the roof of their mouth (this is one reason why smell and taste are so intricately linked).\n\n--- information end ---\n\n When you respond, follow the following rules:\n 0.

The first is to provide capital to companies that they can use to fund and expand their businesses. If a company issues one million shares of stock that initially sell for $10 a share, then that provides the company with $10 million of capital that it can use to grow its business (minus whatever fees the company pays for an investment bank to manage the stock offering). By offering stock shares instead of borrowing the capital needed for expansion, the company avoids incurring debt and paying interest charges on that debt.\n\n2. In summary, the stock market allows corporations and public investors to transfer capital and ownership in a secure and controlled environment. It is a convenient way for companies to raise capital and for individuals to buy, trade or cash out investments. Additionally, the stock market helps to keep corporate practices in check and fuels a nation\u2019s economic growth and individual prosperity.\n\nSource: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122415/what-does-stock-market-do.asp"]}], "tstamp": 1694287903.2398968}

This legal claim gives the tax authorities the right to collect the unpaid taxes from the property owner. It also gives the tax authorities the right to sell the property if the owner does not pay the taxes.\n\nThere are several ways to make money from tax liens:\n\n1. Buy and sell tax liens: You can purchase tax liens from local tax authorities and then resell them for a profit. This involves researching and analyzing tax liens before buying them, as well as keeping track of the status of each lien until it is paid off or sold.\n\n2. Invest in tax lien funds: Some investment companies specialize in purchasing tax liens and managing portfolios of them for investors. This can be a more passive way to invest in tax liens, but it may also come with higher fees and lower returns than buying and selling liens on your own.\n\n3. Participate in tax lien auctions: Some tax authorities hold auctions to sell tax liens to the highest bidder. This can be a way to acquire tax liens at a discount, but it can also be risky if you don't fully understand the legal and financial implications of buying a tax lien.\n\n4. Invest in real estate: Tax liens can be a way to find undervalued properties that can be purchased for a discount. However, it's important to do your research and understand the risks and legal implications before buying any property with a tax lien attached to it.\n\nRemember, investing in tax liens can be a complex and risky endeavor, and it's important to do your due diligence and seek professional advice before making any decisions.\n\n[/INST]"]}], "tstamp": 1694287950.362789}

The small intestine contains a trace amount of microorganisms due to the proximity and influence of the stomach. Gram-positive cocci and rod-shaped bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in the small intestine. However, in the distal portion of the small intestine alkaline conditions support gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial flora of the small intestine aid in a wide range of intestinal functions. The bacterial flora provide regulatory signals that enable the development and utility of the gut. Overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine can lead to intestinal failure. In addition the large intestine contains the largest bacterial ecosystem in the human body. About 99% of the large intestine and feces flora are made up of obligate anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Factors that disrupt the microorganism population of the large intestine include antibiotics, stress, and parasites.\n[INST] I found the following information:\n2. The microbial composition of the gut microbiota varies across the digestive tract. In the stomach and small intestine, relatively few species of bacteria are generally present. The colon, in contrast, contains the highest microbial density recorded in any habitat on Earth with up to 1012 cells per gram of intestinal content. These bacteria represent between 300 and 1000 different species. However, 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species. As a consequence of their abundance in the intestine, bacteria also make up to 60% of the dry mass of feces. Fungi, protists, archaea, and viruses are also present in the gut flora, but less is known about their activities.\n[INST] I found the following information:\n3. Five phyla dominate the intestinal microbiota: Bacteroidota, Bacillota (Firmicutes), Actinomycetota, Pseudomonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota\u2014with Bacteroidota and Bacillota constituting 90% of the composition. Somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut, with most estimates at about 500. However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species, with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (phylum firmicutes) being the most common species in healthy adults.\n[INST] I found the following information:\n4. Researchers have known for some time that humans and the other great apes harbor many types of bacteria, especially in their guts, a collection known as the microbiome. But where did these microbes come from: our ancient ancestors, or our environment? A study of fecal bacteria across all mammals suggested that the microbes are more likely to be inherited than acquired from the environment. But other studies have found that diet plays a major role in shaping the bacteria in our guts.\n[INST] I found the following information:\n5. Bacteria make up most of the flora in the colon and 60% of the dry mass of feces. This fact makes feces an ideal source of gut flora for any tests and experiments by extracting the nucleic acid from fecal specimens, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences are generated with bacterial primers. This form of testing is also often preferable to more invasive techniques, such as biopsies.\n[INST] I found the following information:\nWhere does the bacteria in our intestines come from?\nBacteria in our intestines are believed to come from our ancient ancestors, rather than our environment.\nReference(s):\n- https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/where-did-intestinal-bacteria-come-from/\n[/INST]"]}], "tstamp": 1694287999.5834138}

Nothing is more frustrating than inserting a quarter into a vending machine to get a delicious snack, only for the machine to spit it right back. While trying again with a new coin occasionally solves the problem, sometimes the machine refuses to accept change. Vending machines not taking coins could point to several underlying issues, including low change, dirty or worn-out parts, and outdated mechanisms. Check out some simple fixes to these problems below.\n2. You need to check if slots are empty or not. Machine will return the coins if items are not there to vend or there is a jam in there. If there are items in there, but coins are being returned you need to clear the jam. Take out all the cans or other products before placing them back. Also, check if wheels are working properly. These two important checks should fix the issue for you. If it doesn\u2019t contact your vending machine supplier.\n3. If you're trying to insert a bill into a vending machine that doesn't have enough coins to give you the proper change, it will reject the money.\n4. How many times have you stood in front of a vending machine trying to get it to accept your dollar bill? Probably more than you care to admit. We understand your frustration. Any cashier would gladly accept the same dollar bill, so why won't the vending machine take your money? The answer is at once complicated and simple, and lies in how the dollar bill validator works.\n5. If your vending machine refuses to take bills, then it could be due to 2 reasons. Either, sufficient change is not available in the machine or dollar validators are dysfunctional. You might need to replace loose dollar validators. Check it two three times to ensure that it is working fine now.\n\nThere is no information in the question that explains why sometimes a coin won't work on a vending machine, then after retrying it one or multiple times it will work eventually."]}], "tstamp": 1694288012.1721911}

Even the strongest magnets \u2014 like the superconducting electromagnets in MRI-scanners \u2014 will not be a problem. The iron is not in a ferro- magnetic state in the blood.\n2. Since we\u2019re exposed to magnets on a regular basis every day and magnets attract iron, this brings us to the question- Could the iron in your blood be removed with an especially strong magnet or by a certain mutant with a magnetic personality? And regardless of the answer to that, is it possible to make a magnet strong enough to simply kill you on the spot? And how would this happen? And just what are the most powerful magnets in the universe?\n3. But in fact, it turns out that being around huge magnets doesn\u2019t rip our blood out from under our skin at all. This is because the iron in our blood isn\u2019t made of extra small metallic filings of the element. Instead, the iron atoms are constituent members of the metalloprotein, hemoglobin, which is found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates, and used to carry oxygen from our respiratory organs to the rest of our bodies.\n4. Furthermore, some other molecules have a repulsive diamagnetic property including water, of which there is a lot more of than iron in your body. Thus, even a super powerful magnet like in an MRI only has a miniscule effect on the iron if any, which is why it\u2019s safe for you to be inside one.\n5. Blood seems to be repelled by the magnet. This is called a diamagnetic reaction. but how is this possible with iron in the haemoglobin?"]}], "tstamp": 1694288021.0670445}

It's also possible to activate a grid view via the camera's Setup menu. This can be set to display a 3x3, 6x4 or 3x3 and diagonal grid on the screen when the camera is in Live View mode, and in some DSLRs in the viewfinder. This is a helpful visual aid that makes it easier to align objects in the scene, avoid tilted horizons and create pleasing scenes conforming to the compositional principle known as the Rule of Thirds.\n2. Try this. Look at a distant scene and then quickly look at the rear screen LCD monitor and see how quickly your eye refocuses on it. Do you refocus instantly? Now try the same thing with a camera with an eyepiece. You might discover that your eyes focus more quickly and easily on the LCD screen than with the eyepiece. That\u2019s my experience and one of the reasons I use the LCD screen.\n3. Another advantage of the LCD monitor is its easy-to-see gridline screen display that is available on LCD monitors. This screen display is made up of two horizontal and two vertical lines that divide the frame into thirds. These third lines can be used as a guide for composing images. Placing people and things along the grid lines or at their intersections--instead of the dead center of the frame -- makes stronger images.\n4. Most modern smartphone cameras now can overlay the lines over the screen before taking the photo. These are referred to as either grids or gridlines - and they do not appear on the photo!\n5. The LCD screen works like the Leica glass viewfinder window because it doesn\u2019t limit my peripheral vision. I can see the monitor at the same time as I can see the world around it. This also allows me to see things happening outside the frame and lets me anticipate what may be entering the picture. It is a real help photographing fast moving animals and children and sports.\n\nI found the following answer(s):\n1.
