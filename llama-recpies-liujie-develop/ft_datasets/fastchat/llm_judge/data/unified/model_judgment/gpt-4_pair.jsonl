Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. A hot object, like a campfire, will warm the surrounding air. As the air around an object warms, it rises and mixes with the cool air above it. Light traveling towards you over the hot object would pass from cool air, through the currents of rising warm air, and then back into cool air. At each boundary, the light will change its direction. The temperature difference is constantly changing and the boundaries between the warm and cold air are moving as the heat rises, so the light rays don\u2019t always bend the same amount or in the same place. The visual effect of this unpredictable bending looks like waves coming off of the hot object. This is the same reason that stars appear to twinkle as their light passes through the Earth\u2019s air to where you stand on the ground.\n2. The problem with wind is it doesn't tip the balance in your favour that much. It won't provide much benefit at all near the heat source (ground) anyway. You might gain the ability to shoot a few feet closer to the ground than you would have been able to if the wind wasn't there. So have less heat-haze effect after rotation or before landing, but it's really more theoretical than of practical use. You may notice it's benefits, but it will be more luck than anything.\n3. Intuitively you would expect that this temperature/density issue would be affected by wind, the effect being to churn up and mix the different air masses and so reduce their relative differences in temperature and density. But maybe, dependent on the topography of the area, the wind effect may be almost nullified at very low levels (due to friction effects), and so this refractive problem remains.\n4. The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises.\n5. Wind can help by rapidly mixing the different densities of air. The better the mixing, the more even the air and the less the light is distorted. It probably won't be enough of an effect to help much on a strong sunny day. It's benefit will be more notably though, if the sun pop's behind a cloud for a few minutes.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

However, it probably won't be enough of an effect to help much on a strong sunny day[1]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nHot air distorts view because it causes a changing index of refraction in different regions of air, which results in the bending of light and the creation of shadows with waving, rolling lines[1][4].

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. A hot object, like a campfire, will warm the surrounding air. As the air around an object warms, it rises and mixes with the cool air above it. Light traveling towards you over the hot object would pass from cool air, through the currents of rising warm air, and then back into cool air. At each boundary, the light will change its direction. The temperature difference is constantly changing and the boundaries between the warm and cold air are moving as the heat rises, so the light rays don\u2019t always bend the same amount or in the same place. The visual effect of this unpredictable bending looks like waves coming off of the hot object. This is the same reason that stars appear to twinkle as their light passes through the Earth\u2019s air to where you stand on the ground.\n2. The problem with wind is it doesn't tip the balance in your favour that much. It won't provide much benefit at all near the heat source (ground) anyway. You might gain the ability to shoot a few feet closer to the ground than you would have been able to if the wind wasn't there. So have less heat-haze effect after rotation or before landing, but it's really more theoretical than of practical use. You may notice it's benefits, but it will be more luck than anything.\n3. Intuitively you would expect that this temperature/density issue would be affected by wind, the effect being to churn up and mix the different air masses and so reduce their relative differences in temperature and density. But maybe, dependent on the topography of the area, the wind effect may be almost nullified at very low levels (due to friction effects), and so this refractive problem remains.\n4. The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises.\n5. Wind can help by rapidly mixing the different densities of air. The better the mixing, the more even the air and the less the light is distorted. It probably won't be enough of an effect to help much on a strong sunny day. It's benefit will be more notably though, if the sun pop's behind a cloud for a few minutes.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Air heats up and expands, causing its index of refraction to change, which creates different regions of air with varying indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. Wind, on the other hand, may not help much in reducing the distortion of view because it may not provide much benefit near the heat source (ground) and may also not churn up and mix the different air masses and reduce their relative differences in temperature and density[2][3]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nWind can help by rapidly mixing the different densities of air, which reduces the light distortion.

The initial posts in the Negative Context condition were less likely to be upvoted compared to the Positive Context condition[5]. Additionally, the proportion of flagged posts and proportion of users with flagged posts are rising over time on CNN.com, suggesting that trolling behavior is becoming more common and that a growing fraction of users are engaging in such behavior[4]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nThe Lars AMA has many downvotes because some users may not respond to trolling with more trolling, and may respond with sympathy or understanding, or apologies or joking. However, such responses are rarer[1]. Additionally, the proportion of flagged posts, negative affect, and the proportion of downvotes are all lowest in the morning, and highest in the evening, aligning with when mood is worst[2].

Only a few contemporary societies of uncontacted people are still classified as hunter-gatherers, and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture or pastoralism.\n2. This study, however, exclusively examined modern hunter-gatherer communities, offering limited insight into the exact nature of social structures that existed prior to the Neolithic Revolution. Alain Testart and others have said that anthropologists should be careful when using research on current hunter-gatherer societies to determine the structure of societies in the paleolithic era, emphasising cross-cultural influences, progress and development that such societies have undergone in the past 10,000 years. As such, the combined anthropological and archaeological evidence to date continues to favour previous understandings of early hunter-gatherers as largely egalitarian.\n3. By 1500 CE, agriculture was feeding most of the people in the world. Hunter-gatherer groups in existence today have survived at least loss of territory, and at most, outright attempts to wipe them out. In the past, commercial/governmental activity surrounding such groups and other Indigenous peoples was often one of unmasked hostility. Most of them manage to survive through isolation. Both the Mashco-Piro and Yora people have survived as hunter-gatherers by living deep within the Amazon rainforest and avoiding contact (sometimes violently). The Hadza of Tanzania, on the other hand, live in proximity to settled lands and have extensive contact. Though rare and small in number, there are actually hunter-gatherers still active all over the world, including the Inuit of arctic North America, the Fuegians of southern South America, the Moriori of Polynesia, and the Aka of central Africa.\n4.

As an example of hunter-gatherers today, the Hadza live in the open, so to speak. They trade with their settled neighbors and even have some income from tourism. They are fully nomadic, however, spending part of the year sleeping completely outdoors. They are still subject to encroachment by settled people. They are currently restricted to a reservation, though they still hunt outside of it. They do not pay taxes in Tanzania. This mixture of isolation, trade, and their special status, combined with real threats to their way of life, is indicative of the struggle true hunter-gatherers face.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Why did they not move in to the neolithic stage of human social development?\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nUncontacted tribes still live as hunter-gatherers due to a variety of factors, such as their isolation from settled lands, their survival through avoiding contact with others, and their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. They did not move into the Neolithic stage of human social development because they have been able to survive in their current way of life, and have managed to avoid being forced to adopt a more settled lifestyle. Additionally, their way of life may be more suitable to their environment and their needs, and they may have chosen to maintain their traditional way of life over adopting a more modern lifestyle. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nHunter-gatherer groups in existence today have survived at least loss of territory, and at most, outright attempts to wipe them out[3]. They have managed to survive through isolation, trade, and their special status, combined with real threats to their way of life[3][5]. Additionally, they may have chosen to remain hunter-gatherers because it is a way of life that has allowed them to survive for many generations, and they may feel a sense of pride in maintaining their traditional way of life[3]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Assistant B's response is more accurate and relevant to the user's question.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Only a few contemporary societies of uncontacted people are still classified as hunter-gatherers, and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture or pastoralism.\n2. This study, however, exclusively examined modern hunter-gatherer communities, offering limited insight into the exact nature of social structures that existed prior to the Neolithic Revolution. Alain Testart and others have said that anthropologists should be careful when using research on current hunter-gatherer societies to determine the structure of societies in the paleolithic era, emphasising cross-cultural influences, progress and development that such societies have undergone in the past 10,000 years. As such, the combined anthropological and archaeological evidence to date continues to favour previous understandings of early hunter-gatherers as largely egalitarian.\n3. By 1500 CE, agriculture was feeding most of the people in the world. Hunter-gatherer groups in existence today have survived at least loss of territory, and at most, outright attempts to wipe them out. In the past, commercial/governmental activity surrounding such groups and other Indigenous peoples was often one of unmasked hostility. Most of them manage to survive through isolation. Both the Mashco-Piro and Yora people have survived as hunter-gatherers by living deep within the Amazon rainforest and avoiding contact (sometimes violently). The Hadza of Tanzania, on the other hand, live in proximity to settled lands and have extensive contact. Though rare and small in number, there are actually hunter-gatherers still active all over the world, including the Inuit of arctic North America, the Fuegians of southern South America, the Moriori of Polynesia, and the Aka of central Africa.\n4.

As an example of hunter-gatherers today, the Hadza live in the open, so to speak. They trade with their settled neighbors and even have some income from tourism. They are fully nomadic, however, spending part of the year sleeping completely outdoors. They are still subject to encroachment by settled people. They are currently restricted to a reservation, though they still hunt outside of it. They do not pay taxes in Tanzania. This mixture of isolation, trade, and their special status, combined with real threats to their way of life, is indicative of the struggle true hunter-gatherers face.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The lack of humidity is the main reason. Humidity is what helps heat to remain in the air during the night. Deserts are extremely dry places with almost no humidity, so the heat can\u2019t be retained during the night. This happens in a lot of other tropical places.\n3. - The main reason why temperatures drop in deserts during the night is because of sand: it is not able to hold heat, and it turns the entire desert hot.\n4. - Not all deserts get cold during the night. The air in dry areas cools off when there are no clouds covering the area, when there is no wind or, naturally, when there is almost no moisture in the air.\n5. Most people are aware of the fact that most deserts are scorching during the day, but the temperature gets much colder at night. However, many are not aware as to why this happens and also how cold does it get during the night. The thing is, there are many different types of deserts in the world.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. The copyright term is the length of time copyright subsists in a work before it passes into the public domain. In most of the world, this length of time is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years.\n2. But is there a point to be made here? Are copyrights too long? At the outset, these arguments are based on a half-truth. The copyright term for an individual is indeed the life of the author plus 70 years after death. 7 Yet, the target of these arguments is uniformly the so called \u201cbig copyright\u201d players, namely the Hollywood motion picture and television studios and the music recording industry. These copyrights, being founded on the doctrine of \u201cwork made for hire\u201d last for a much more modest 95 years. 8 Still too much?\n3. Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition or novel), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. In most countries (for example, the United States and the United Kingdom) copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in question.\n4. When a person, typically the author, rightfully owns a copyright of a work, that right is not extinguished upon death. Instead, that right exists for an additional 70 years past the life of the author. If the owner of a copyright has a will, he can bequest his copyright to whoever he wants. If he dies without a will, his heirs at law will inherit the copyright.\n5. If the new owner, the beneficiary of the copyright dies within those 70 years, the new owner may bequeath the copyright in a will, or her heirs at law will receive it upon her death. After the copyright term expires, the work enters the public domain, meaning that the copyright owner no longer retains any rights to the work. At that point, the intellectual property right can no longer be passed down. Hence why so many theater companies use Shakespeare\u2019s plays; his work is in the public domain. He has been dead since 1616, so there are no copyright protections.

At the outset, these arguments are based on a half-truth. The copyright term for an individual is indeed the life of the author plus 70 years after death. 7 Yet, the target of these arguments is uniformly the so called \u201cbig copyright\u201d players, namely the Hollywood motion picture and television studios and the music recording industry. These copyrights, being founded on the doctrine of \u201cwork made for hire\u201d last for a much more modest 95 years. 8 Still too much?\n3. Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition or novel), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. In most countries (for example, the United States and the United Kingdom) copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in question.\n4. When a person, typically the author, rightfully owns a copyright of a work, that right is not extinguished upon death. Instead, that right exists for an additional 70 years past the life of the author. If the owner of a copyright has a will, he can bequest his copyright to whoever he wants. If he dies without a will, his heirs at law will inherit the copyright.\n5. If the new owner, the beneficiary of the copyright dies within those 70 years, the new owner may bequeath the copyright in a will, or her heirs at law will receive it upon her death. After the copyright term expires, the work enters the public domain, meaning that the copyright owner no longer retains any rights to the work. At that point, the intellectual property right can no longer be passed down. Hence why so many theater companies use Shakespeare\u2019s plays; his work is in the public domain. He has been dead since 1616, so there are no copyright protections. This means you do not need to pay royalties, making performance cheaper.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Why isn't it a constant length for every work?\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nThe copyright term depends on the life of the author because it is the basis for calculating the length of the copyright. In most of the world, the copyright term is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. This is so that the copyright holder can have a monopoly on their work, which is the purpose of copyright. The copyright term is not a constant length for every work because the length of the term can depend on several factors, such as the type of work, whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation[3]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nThe copyright term is the length of time copyright subsists in a work before it passes into the public domain.

This reform follows a tentative agreement with the Justice Department from January 2016[1]. However, in February 2016, the City Council amended the agreement[1]. This led to the Justice Department suing Ferguson[1].

This settlement was reached after seven months of negotiations and follows the failure of Ferguson to fully approve a previously agreed-upon deal with the Justice Department in 2016[1]. In response to Ferguson's proposed revisions, the Justice Department responded by suing the city[1].

In short, the transmission of data wirelessly is made possible by the manipulation of radio waves. These waves are generated naturally by generating pulses of electricity. These radio waves can then be modified by their amplitude or frequency in order to transmit sound or data.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Taste preferences in humans are influenced by different factors including genetics, culture, repeated exposures and role models such as parents and siblings, and taste preferences change over time. Sweet tastes are preferred by newborns and bitter tastes are disliked by infants. In general humans are born with a biological predisposition to prefer sweet and to avoid bitter foods such as green leafy vegetables. It has been hypothesized that this predisposition evolved to attract children to energy-dense foods while discouraging the consumption of toxins. There are at least 25 known genes in the bitter taste receptor family in humans. \u201cSweet\u201d perception involves at least 3 genes, and others have been identified for sour and salty foods.\n2. When researchers consider the classic five categories of taste\u2014sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami\u2014there\u2019s little disagreement over which of them is the least understood. Creatures crave sweet for sugar and calories. A yen for umami, or savoriness, keeps many animals nourished with protein. Salt\u2019s essential for bodies to stay in fluid balance, and for nerve cells to signal. And a sensitivity to bitterness can come in handy with the whole not-poisoning-yourself thing.\n3. And yet we taste sour, strongly, and are not alone in doing so. When Dunn and his colleagues recently set out to investigate the sensation\u2019s evolutionary roots, he told me, they couldn\u2019t find a single backboned species that had definitively lost the ability to identify acidic foods, be they birds or mammals or amphibians or reptiles or fish. Admittedly, that may be a function of how few animals scientists have surveyed\u2014just several dozen\u2014but already, that makes sour a standout. Cats, otters, hyenas, and other carnivores have lost the ability to suss out sugar; giant pandas are immune to umami; dolphins, which swallow their prey whole, don\u2019t seem to be able to savor sweetness or savoriness, and have booted bitter sensitivity too. But sour sensing appears to have staying power that its cousins do not\u2014which means that it must be doing something important, perhaps something ancient.\n4. Humans can detect sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory tastes. This allows us to determine if foods are safe or harmful to eat.\n5. Most of us get in line at the ice cream shop or tear into a piece of chocolate cake without giving much thought to why we like what we do. Humans appreciate a wide variety of tastes because of our omnivorous evolutionary history and the genes we carry that allow us to sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (i.e., savory) flavors.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Taste preferences in humans are influenced by different factors including genetics, culture, repeated exposures and role models such as parents and siblings, and taste preferences change over time. Sweet tastes are preferred by newborns and bitter tastes are disliked by infants. In general humans are born with a biological predisposition to prefer sweet and to avoid bitter foods such as green leafy vegetables. It has been hypothesized that this predisposition evolved to attract children to energy-dense foods while discouraging the consumption of toxins. There are at least 25 known genes in the bitter taste receptor family in humans. \u201cSweet\u201d perception involves at least 3 genes, and others have been identified for sour and salty foods.\n2. When researchers consider the classic five categories of taste\u2014sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami\u2014there\u2019s little disagreement over which of them is the least understood. Creatures crave sweet for sugar and calories. A yen for umami, or savoriness, keeps many animals nourished with protein. Salt\u2019s essential for bodies to stay in fluid balance, and for nerve cells to signal. And a sensitivity to bitterness can come in handy with the whole not-poisoning-yourself thing.\n3. And yet we taste sour, strongly, and are not alone in doing so. When Dunn and his colleagues recently set out to investigate the sensation\u2019s evolutionary roots, he told me, they couldn\u2019t find a single backboned species that had definitively lost the ability to identify acidic foods, be they birds or mammals or amphibians or reptiles or fish. Admittedly, that may be a function of how few animals scientists have surveyed\u2014just several dozen\u2014but already, that makes sour a standout. Cats, otters, hyenas, and other carnivores have lost the ability to suss out sugar; giant pandas are immune to umami; dolphins, which swallow their prey whole, don\u2019t seem to be able to savor sweetness or savoriness, and have booted bitter sensitivity too. But sour sensing appears to have staying power that its cousins do not\u2014which means that it must be doing something important, perhaps something ancient.\n4. Humans can detect sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory tastes. This allows us to determine if foods are safe or harmful to eat.\n5. Most of us get in line at the ice cream shop or tear into a piece of chocolate cake without giving much thought to why we like what we do. Humans appreciate a wide variety of tastes because of our omnivorous evolutionary history and the genes we carry that allow us to sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (i.e., savory) flavors. But the same isn\u2019t true of all animals. Most cats, for example, dubiously sniff at sweets. This is because, over the course of its evolutionary history, the feline lineage lost a functional gene to detect sweet flavors.

With the exception of the slow-moving soil centipedes, which are built to burrow, Chilopods can run fast. A centipede's body is suspended in a cradle of long legs.

Having so many legs can be advantageous because of the ability to prevent falling, as well as having other legs take over when some legs may malfunction. In order to study locomotion and maneuverability by using multiple legs simultaneously, scientists created a centipede-like robot (with 12 legs) (Aoi et al. 2016). The same study reported the important relationship between stability and maneuverability, especially during the turning experiments carried out by their robot.\n5. Should a centipede find itself in the grip of a bird or other predator, it can often escape by sacrificing a few legs. The bird is left with a beak full of legs, and the clever centipede makes a fast escape on those that remain. Since centipedes continue to molt as adults, they can usually repair the damage by simply regenerating legs. If you find a centipede with a few legs that are shorter than the others, it is likely in the process of recovering from a predator attack.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

When you\u2019re traveling for the holidays later this month, you might notice some signs on the highway that read \u201cspeed limit enforced by aircraft.\u201d If you\u2019re like me, those signs conjure images of the cops scrambling a team of jet fighters to take a driver with a lead foot off the road. In reality, it\u2019s a little less exciting. Here\u2019s how it works in Pennsylvania (where I live and always obey the speed limit), according to the state police.\n2. If a radar-enforced speed limit sign means that a police officer could be hiding nearby, does an aircraft-enforced speed limit sign mean that there is an officer in a plane somewhere above you? Well, yes and no. Most often, helicopters are used for aircraft-enforced speed limits, as helicopters have an easier time hovering in one spot in the air. While you typically won\u2019t see an aircraft recording the speeds of passing cars, it is a possibility \u2014 and some roadways are even patrolled by drones, which can operate without a a pilot.\n3.

The signs are meant to act as a deterrent to speeding, as drivers may be more cautious if they think there is a police officer in the air[2][4].

When you\u2019re traveling for the holidays later this month, you might notice some signs on the highway that read \u201cspeed limit enforced by aircraft.\u201d If you\u2019re like me, those signs conjure images of the cops scrambling a team of jet fighters to take a driver with a lead foot off the road. In reality, it\u2019s a little less exciting. Here\u2019s how it works in Pennsylvania (where I live and always obey the speed limit), according to the state police.\n2. If a radar-enforced speed limit sign means that a police officer could be hiding nearby, does an aircraft-enforced speed limit sign mean that there is an officer in a plane somewhere above you? Well, yes and no. Most often, helicopters are used for aircraft-enforced speed limits, as helicopters have an easier time hovering in one spot in the air. While you typically won\u2019t see an aircraft recording the speeds of passing cars, it is a possibility \u2014 and some roadways are even patrolled by drones, which can operate without a a pilot.\n3.

While enjoying the scenic highways that run through California, you may have noticed traffic signs that read, \u201cSpeed Limit Enforced by Radar,\u201d or even some signs that say, \u201cSpeed Limit Enforced by Aircraft.\u201d Neither sign gives much description as to how the process works, however, and may leave you wondering how your speed is actually monitored. Here\u2019s a snapshot of how it works:\n5. We\u2019ve all seen the signs on the highway: \u201cSpeed limit enforced by aircraft.\u201d Every time I pass one I think how unlikely it is the state or local government has enough money, time, or interest to scramble a jet on my behalf. (Actually, my precise thought-words are usually, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d) In my mind, the signs have always been in the same category of deterrent as the lie parents tell their kids about a special chemical that makes pool water change colors when you pee.

As holders of the IP rights in its creative works, Marvel has been able to leverage the commercial value of its superheroes through a series of profitable licensing agreements. These agreements define and structure the business relationship between the licensee and the licensor, outlining the terms and conditions by which a manufacturer may produce, for example, a toy in the likeness of a given character.\n2. Marvel\u2019s robust IP assets have without a doubt enabled it to reap enormous benefits from its licensing activities. Its low-risk movie-licensing strategy has meant that film studios carry all the financial risk in developing the film, while creating multiple marketing opportunities for Marvel. Even where a film, such as Ang Lee\u2019s Hulk, disappointed at the box office, Marvel enjoyed significant revenue from film-related merchandise sales and an upsurge of interest in its comic books. Sales of the role play toys known as \u201cHulk Hands\u201d (a pair of large costume gloves), for example, have been valued at US$100 million. Moreover, Marvel\u2019s astute business strategy has enabled it to further leverage the commercial value of its characters by striking licensing deals across multiple media platforms.\n3. When asked whether Marvel Studios was considering ways to bring film-licensed characters back home in an interview with HeyUGuys, Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios\u2019 President said, \u201cthe contracts are all very specific, and if there is ever a time for them to revert, they will. But right now they are safely at those studios\u2026 The truth is\u2026 there are almost 8,000 characters in the Marvel library\u2026 and not all of them would make a movie, but a lot of them will.\u201d\n4. Comics may also be protected under trademark law. Trademarks are used to protect the names and likenesses of Marvel\u2019s comic book superheroes. This protection has been key to enabling Marvel to build and secure sizeable revenue from character merchandizing, an activity that has been further boosted by the company\u2019s movie licensing strategy.\n5. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Marvel\u2019s licensing strategy enabled it to distribute its characters beyond comic books to multiple media formats, including films, television, and video games. Today, Marvel\u2019s merchandizing reach has no limits, and can include anything from toys to perfume and clothing to luxury cars. During this period, Marvel sold options to major studios to produce films based on its characters. Despite the success of its character-licensing business, Marvel was keen to acquire full control over its creative assets and a greater stake in the box office returns generated by these movies. The creation of Marvel Studios in August 1996 was an important step in achieving this goal.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Moreover, Marvel\u2019s astute business strategy has enabled it to further leverage the commercial value of its characters by striking licensing deals across multiple media platforms.\n3. When asked whether Marvel Studios was considering ways to bring film-licensed characters back home in an interview with HeyUGuys, Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios\u2019 President said, \u201cthe contracts are all very specific, and if there is ever a time for them to revert, they will. But right now they are safely at those studios\u2026 The truth is\u2026 there are almost 8,000 characters in the Marvel library\u2026 and not all of them would make a movie, but a lot of them will.\u201d\n4. Comics may also be protected under trademark law. Trademarks are used to protect the names and likenesses of Marvel\u2019s comic book superheroes. This protection has been key to enabling Marvel to build and secure sizeable revenue from character merchandizing, an activity that has been further boosted by the company\u2019s movie licensing strategy.\n5. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Marvel\u2019s licensing strategy enabled it to distribute its characters beyond comic books to multiple media formats, including films, television, and video games. Today, Marvel\u2019s merchandizing reach has no limits, and can include anything from toys to perfume and clothing to luxury cars. During this period, Marvel sold options to major studios to produce films based on its characters. Despite the success of its character-licensing business, Marvel was keen to acquire full control over its creative assets and a greater stake in the box office returns generated by these movies. The creation of Marvel Studios in August 1996 was an important step in achieving this goal.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

(TL;DR warning below this point)\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nMarvel's character licensing works by leveraging its IP rights in its creative works, such as comics, to establish low-risk licensing agreements with manufacturers for the production of toys and other merchandise. Marvel's movie-licensing strategy allows it to carry all the financial risk in developing the film, while creating multiple marketing opportunities for Marvel and leveraging the commercial value of its characters across multiple media platforms. Additionally, Marvel's trademark protection of its characters' names and likenesses enables it to secure sizeable revenue from character merchandizing, which has been further boosted by its movie licensing strategy. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nMarvel's character licensing works by striking licensing agreements with manufacturers to produce toys, merchandise, and other products in the likeness of its characters. These agreements define and structure the business relationship between the licensee and the licensor, outlining the terms and conditions by which a manufacturer may produce a product with a character from Marvel's IP assets[1]. Marvel's robust IP assets have enabled it to reap enormous benefits from its licensing activities, as evidenced by the success of the Hulk Hands, which have generated over $100 million in sales[2]. Marvel's character-licensing business has been further boosted by its astute business strategy, which has enabled it to leverage the commercial value of its characters across multiple media platforms[2]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide accurate and relevant responses to the user's question about how Marvel's character licensing works.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. While a wet nose is a healthy sign in your dog, a dry nose isn\u2019t necessarily cause for worry. Young dogs that love to lick are going to have wet noses, but as dogs age, their noses typically become a bit dryer. The dryness could also be a sign that your canine is dehydrated, Dr. Lands says, so be sure your dog gets plenty of water.\n2. So although a wet nose is an indicator of good health, while a dry nose can mean the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s not always this clear. A healthy dog can have a dry or moist nose, but if they get ill can become too dry or too wet. Be on the lookout for changes like this as they can be great early warning signs your dog isn\u2019t quite tip-top. But just be sure to spot other changes too, as a dry or wet nose on its own doesn\u2019t indicate health on its own.\n3. A very, very wet nose can also be a sign that your dog is sick. Dogs are like humans in that \u201cif we start to get some sort of infection in our nose or upper respiratory infection, our noses can become more moist and we can start getting some mucus buildup in our nose or coming out of our nostrils,\u201d Dr. Lands says.\n4. Most often, a wet dog nose means they are healthy. However, a dry nose doesn\u2019t always point to a problem. The level of moisture and temperature of your dog\u2019s nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions. Sometimes, it can even fluctuate during a single day! Your pup may get a dry nose after a nap, or after intense playtime that left them dehydrated. The same is true for the temperature of your puppy's nose. Don\u2019t fret if you notice their nose is a bit warmer than usually, chances are it\u2019s just due to the weather.\n5. The answer is: sometimes! A healthy dog\u2019s nose can be wet for various reasons that help with its functions. All noses secrete some mucus to trap anything that might damage the lungs \u2013 if this drips down, the clear fluid can moisten their nose. Dogs also lick their noses regularly which makes them wet \u2013 by doing this they carry some scent particles into their mouths which can then be sensed through a special organ called the vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson\u2019s organ, in the roof of their mouth (this is one reason why smell and taste are so intricately linked).\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Young dogs that love to lick are going to have wet noses, but as dogs age, their noses typically become a bit dryer. The dryness could also be a sign that your canine is dehydrated, Dr. Lands says, so be sure your dog gets plenty of water.\n2. So although a wet nose is an indicator of good health, while a dry nose can mean the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s not always this clear. A healthy dog can have a dry or moist nose, but if they get ill can become too dry or too wet. Be on the lookout for changes like this as they can be great early warning signs your dog isn\u2019t quite tip-top. But just be sure to spot other changes too, as a dry or wet nose on its own doesn\u2019t indicate health on its own.\n3. A very, very wet nose can also be a sign that your dog is sick. Dogs are like humans in that \u201cif we start to get some sort of infection in our nose or upper respiratory infection, our noses can become more moist and we can start getting some mucus buildup in our nose or coming out of our nostrils,\u201d Dr. Lands says.\n4. Most often, a wet dog nose means they are healthy. However, a dry nose doesn\u2019t always point to a problem. The level of moisture and temperature of your dog\u2019s nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions. Sometimes, it can even fluctuate during a single day! Your pup may get a dry nose after a nap, or after intense playtime that left them dehydrated. The same is true for the temperature of your puppy's nose. Don\u2019t fret if you notice their nose is a bit warmer than usually, chances are it\u2019s just due to the weather.\n5. The answer is: sometimes! A healthy dog\u2019s nose can be wet for various reasons that help with its functions. All noses secrete some mucus to trap anything that might damage the lungs \u2013 if this drips down, the clear fluid can moisten their nose. Dogs also lick their noses regularly which makes them wet \u2013 by doing this they carry some scent particles into their mouths which can then be sensed through a special organ called the vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson\u2019s organ, in the roof of their mouth (this is one reason why smell and taste are so intricately linked).\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This moisture is a sign of good health, but a very wet nose can also be a sign of an upper respiratory infection[3]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nA wet dog nose is a sign of a healthy dog because it indicates that the mucus is trapping any particles that could damage the lungs, and the dog is licking its nose regularly to pick up scent particles, which it can then sense through its vomeronasal organ[5]. A dry nose is not necessarily a sign of an unhealthy dog, but it could be a sign of dehydration or illness[1][2][3]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide accurate and relevant responses to the user's question. They both explain that a dog's nose is wet due to mucus secretion and regular licking, which aids in scent processing through the vomeronasal organ. They also both mention that a wet nose is generally a sign of good health, but a very wet nose could indicate an upper respiratory infection. However, Assistant B goes a step further by also mentioning that a dry nose could be a sign of dehydration or illness, which provides a more comprehensive answer to the user's question.

A retinal scan is a biometric technique that maps the unique patterns of a person\u2019s retina using a low-intensity light source. Through a delicate sensor, a retinal scan examines the pattern of retina blood vessels, which remains unchanged from birth until death.\n2. A retinal scan is a biometric technique that uses unique patterns on a person's retina blood vessels. It is not to be confused with other ocular-based technologies: iris recognition, commonly called an \"iris scan\", and eye vein verification that uses scleral veins.\n3. Once the scanner captures a retinal image, the software compiles all the unique features of the network of retinal blood vessels (capillaries). The scanner then generates a micro sized template which helps in detecting the authentic access. Only an enrolled person can be identified with a retinal scan after acclimating to the process.\n4. The retina is regarded as one of the most reliable biometric modalities available in the marketplace nowadays. Since retinal recognition templates are incredibly small, it is quite fast to confirm the identity of a person. Once identity is verified through a retinal scan, there is almost no error given the high number of unique data points of the retina. Simply put, it is virtually impossible to be falsely accepted by a retinal recognition system.\n5. A retinal scan is performed by casting an unperceived beam of low-energy infrared light into a person\u2019s eye as they look through the scanner's eyepiece. This beam of light traces a standardized path on the retina. Because retinal blood vessels absorb light more readily than the surrounding tissue, the amount of reflection varies during the scan. The pattern of variations is digitized and stored in a database.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The classified catalog, which was recently published online by the Israeli state, also contains more than 300,000 classified files and is a significant source of new information[3]. Furthermore, the classified catalog contains documents that date back to before the state was founded, which makes it an important resource for understanding the history of Israel[4]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide relevant and accurate responses to the user's question.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. I have a friend who has someone asking him to accept a personal check for mobile deposit but the check he is supposed to take the photo of, it isn\u2019t an actual photo but rather a scanned copy. I haven\u2019t had to provide any personal or financial information and I don\u2019t think my banking app will accept it but I feel like I should keep my guard up. Is it possible for them to gain access to my account in such a manner?\n2. Whether you deposit a check into a bank account from an ATM, in-branch with a teller, or from a mobile deposit capture, the process for clearing and check acceptance is generally the same. Because paper checks have no actual monetary value themselves, banks have to verify whether the transaction can actually be completed or not. When the check is captured, financial institutions use a variety of data points to make a judgment about the validity of the check. The data they acquire needs to answer questions like, is the account of the check issuer in good standing? Are there enough funds in their account? Is the check a high dollar amount?\n3. - A new federal law known as the \"Check 21 Act\" makes it easier for banks to create and send electronic images of paper checks. Even before Check 21, banks were allowed to process checks electronically when all the banks in the process agreed. Under Check 21, any bank may create a special paper copy\u2014called a \"substitute check\"\u2014using images of the front and back of an original check. If any bank in the process requires a paper check, another bank can send a substitute check in place of the original.\n4. If you\u2019re holding onto a check that\u2019s suspect, you can try to verify funds in the account. To do so, contact the bank that the check is drawn on and ask to verify funds. Some banks, in the interest of privacy, will only tell you whether or not the account is valid, or they will not provide any information at all.\n5. It\u2019s possible to verify a check before you try to deposit it at your bank, and it\u2019s wise to do so with any checks you have doubts about\u2014especially large ones. You'll want to make sure a check is valid and the writer has sufficient funds available before you deposit it, or else it can bounce.

The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function[5]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and detailed responses to the question about the concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). They both used the information they found to explain that OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code. They also both mentioned that OOP is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. They both explained that the main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n\nHowever, Assistant B's response was slightly more comprehensive as it included the additional detail that OOP aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming[5].

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. See, there\u2019s a thing in the NFL called an \u201cinjury settlement,\u201d whereby if a player gets injured during the preseason, and the team wants to get rid of that player, they have to cover his medical costs and salary for the weeks he\u2019s predicted to be injured in a one-time payout. This amount can be in the thousands, if not the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and, well, NFL teams don\u2019t like parting with their money.\n2. The norm for NFL players are provisions that allow a team to cut a player at the beginning of the next year. So, the usual rule is that a player will always get paid for the current season, even if they do not play at all, but if they are unable to play due to an injury then the team can release them and terminate the contract the next year, as long as they decide to do so by a particular date, which is usually in March. Note that if a player cannot play due to injury, usually they get paid injury pay which is less than their full pay, but is still a substantial.\n3. Farmer: An injured player gets paid for as long as he\u2019s unable to play, no matter what his contract says. A team can\u2019t release an injured player until he\u2019s cleared. For most rookie contracts, players selected in the third round or later, there\u2019s something called an \u201cup-down,\u201d which is two minimum salaries negotiated in the collective bargaining agreement. The \u201cup\u201d is the minimum active salary, which this season is $420,000, and the \u201cdown\u201d ($303,000) is the minimum inactive salary. If a player is injured after eight games, he\u2019s paid eight weeks \u201cup\u201d and nine weeks \u201cdown\u201d (eight weeks, plus the bye). For most veterans, there is no \u201cdown.\u201d It\u2019s whatever he\u2019s scheduled to earn. If a player gets hurt doing a football-related activity, he\u2019s covered, no matter when it happens. So if he tears his anterior cruciate ligament in a May minicamp, he\u2019s covered.\n4. There are also injury settlements, which must be agreed to within five days of a player being placed on injured reserve. Say a player suffers a sprained ankle in training camp and it\u2019s a three-week injury. The team can pay him for those three weeks, then release him. That player is eligible to return to that team after the number of weeks the settlement was for (in this case, three), plus another six weeks. So he would be eligible to return in any capacity by Week 10. That six-week \u201ctax\u201d is put in place so teams can\u2019t stash players by saying they\u2019re injured. If a player suffers an injury doing something unrelated to football, he\u2019s placed on the reserve/non-football injury list. It\u2019s at the discretion of the team whether the player is paid.\n5. If a player has an injury guarantee in his contract, that player will get paid his money. Let's say a player signs a five-year deal and has injury guarantees for the first three seasons. These guarantees state that said player will get his entire salary even if he is injured at any point in the first three years.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

So there you have it, no, the fish generally don't die en mass when lightning strikes. Lightning striking the ocean is quickly dissipated across the surface, but if you happen to be swimming about with a nice big steel conductor tied to your back like a scuba diver, you could well up your odds of being hit and in for a rough day. But still, it's way safer to be in the sea than playing a round of golf.\n2. On land, the impact of a lightning strike tends to be vertical, with each bolt striking its target and heading in a downwards direction. Water, however, acts as a strong conductor of electricity and behaves differently to solid materials. On hitting the water, lightning spreads horizontally: it\u2019s not just what\u2019s at the point of impact that\u2019s at risk but anything that finds itself in the surrounding areas too. Fish, boats, swimmers, divers \u2013 they can all be impacted.\n3. So in the unusual event that lightning does in fact strike the sea, do fish get electrocuted? Apparently not, unlike air, the sea is a very good conductor as it contains salt. Rather than creating an direct narrow, path concentrating the \"punch\", the charge from the lightning strike spreads out sideways and downwards in an expanding half sphere from the surface. Any fish within a few meters of the strike area would probably be killed but beyond that they would probably just feel a tingle. Fish also tend to be a bit deeper in the water and not at the surface where the current is concentrated. So again, the odds are well stacked in favor of the fish.

Lowering public pensions' investment-return assumptions to more realistic levels and updating mortality will increase governments' pension debt. The next step in fixing public-pension funding is to determine how the debt will be paid down over time, or amortized. Most public pensions currently spread pension-debt payments over 30 years or more and backload those payments so that they get larger as payroll grows. The result is that government payments often do not reduce the initial pension debt much over the first 10 to 20 years of the payment schedule. And it is actually common for plans to build in periods of negative amortization, where the pension debt grows because expected payments are not large enough to cover the interest on the debt.\n2. The only way to ensure that pension costs and benefits are distributed equitably across generations of workers and taxpayers is to fully fund benefits as they are earned. And having a strong pension-funding policy is more important now than ever before because pensions are bigger and riskier now than ever before. As noted above, state and local public pensions are 47.5% funded at this point, but even that may be misleading. The last time pension funding was at roughly this level was 1983, when liabilities were approximately 18% of GDP. Today, liabilities are more than twice as large relative to GDP (42%). Because of pensions' increased scale, relatively small misses on the anticipated investment return or other assumptions (like mortality) would have outsized future budgetary implications.

Yet this should only be done in exceptional circumstances and for a short period of time, preferably using public pension funds rather than individual pension accounts. If done in a targeted way, using pension funds for financial repression can result in citizens benefiting in economic growth and recovery over the long term in return for a short-term reduction in investment returns. At worst, this policy depletes pension savings without delivering welfare gains.

Fixing public-pension funding is not technically difficult, but in most jurisdictions, fully funding pensions at this point would require significantly higher contributions or reduced benefits (or both), making a solution politically challenging to achieve. However, failing to take meaningful action to close the funding gap will only make the problem more challenging and painful to fix in the future.

Lowering public pensions' investment-return assumptions to more realistic levels and updating mortality will increase governments' pension debt. The next step in fixing public-pension funding is to determine how the debt will be paid down over time, or amortized. Most public pensions currently spread pension-debt payments over 30 years or more and backload those payments so that they get larger as payroll grows. The result is that government payments often do not reduce the initial pension debt much over the first 10 to 20 years of the payment schedule. And it is actually common for plans to build in periods of negative amortization, where the pension debt grows because expected payments are not large enough to cover the interest on the debt.\n2. The only way to ensure that pension costs and benefits are distributed equitably across generations of workers and taxpayers is to fully fund benefits as they are earned. And having a strong pension-funding policy is more important now than ever before because pensions are bigger and riskier now than ever before. As noted above, state and local public pensions are 47.5% funded at this point, but even that may be misleading.

Substituting meat for tofu can easily result in a loss of fat and calories in your diet. Additionally, tofu's high protein content allows you to repair muscles after exercise, rather than having them broken down to be used for fuel.\n3. While there may be some variation in the nutrient content of fresh versus packaged tofu\u2014omega-3 fatty acids, for instance, can degrade with exposure to light and air\u2014the quantity and quality of amino acids should be the same. Using soy products as a source of protein lets you reduce your intake of meat, which may well confer a net health benefit\u2014especially if the meat being replaced is high in saturated fat.\n4. Tofu has become a rising star in the meat substitute world, especially because it is full of protein. 3oz of tofu is comprised of about 18% protein while skinless roast chicken comes in at approximately 46%. But that doesn\u2019t mean it's any less healthy! Tofu and chicken protein isn\u2019t the only nutritional value to take into consideration.\n5.

ELI5: Can I replace all meat that I eat with tofu (let's say 24g of protein every few days) and still be healthy?\n2. You can still classify tofu as low-carb and low fat. Substituting meat for tofu can easily result in a loss of fat and calories in your diet. Additionally, tofu's high protein content allows you to repair muscles after exercise, rather than having them broken down to be used for fuel.\n3. While there may be some variation in the nutrient content of fresh versus packaged tofu\u2014omega-3 fatty acids, for instance, can degrade with exposure to light and air\u2014the quantity and quality of amino acids should be the same. Using soy products as a source of protein lets you reduce your intake of meat, which may well confer a net health benefit\u2014especially if the meat being replaced is high in saturated fat.\n4. Tofu has become a rising star in the meat substitute world, especially because it is full of protein. 3oz of tofu is comprised of about 18% protein while skinless roast chicken comes in at approximately 46%. But that doesn\u2019t mean it's any less healthy! Tofu and chicken protein isn\u2019t the only nutritional value to take into consideration.\n5.

Examples of these tactics include offshore evasion, underreported income from pass-through business entities, and the use of cryptocurrencies[5]. The IRS is often unable to challenge these tactics because it is outgunned in audits of and litigation against large corporations[5]. Additionally, the IRS has been vastly underfunded, with estimates suggesting that as much as $36 billion a year in taxes are unpaid by Americans hiding wealth abroad, and more than $50 billion more is lost due to corporations shifting taxable profits offshore[1].

Thus, the government has a major role to play in policy formation in order to retain skilled employees.\n2. The U.S. unemployment rate was 13.3% as of May 2020, but at the same time, the U.S. underemployment rate was 22.8%. The unemployment rate is defined by the BLS as including \"as a percentage of the labor force (the labor force is the sum of the employed and unemployed).\" A measure of underemployment is needed to express the opportunity cost of advanced skills not being used or being underutilized.\n3. The difference between unemployment and underemployment can be explained as the economic situation in which an individual who is actively searching for employment is unable to find work (unemployment) and a situation where individuals do not utilize their skills and education optimally in their jobs (underemployment). Employment opportunities are generally low in developing nations thus many individuals migrate to developed nations in search of favorable employment conditions. Government policies should be in place to ensure that the country\u2019s individuals are employed as well as they are employed in jobs that enable them to utilize their education, skills, and ability to work to produce economic output.\n4. Underemployment is an often misunderstood part of the economy. Unemployment is a term that refers to the number of people who want a job and do not have one. Underemployment represents people who are working but are not working in a job that matches their skills or abilities, often leading to earning less than what he or she should earn. When a person cannot find a job that matches their availability, skills, and experience, that is called underemployment. When considering who has a job and how many people are without one, it\u2019s critical to understand the full picture.\n5.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. In the last few years it has been discovered that there are a number of different ways of making the same artificial flavor. Chemical A and Chemical B are combined, and peppermint flavor appears. Another researcher tries putting Chemical C and Chemical D together - and peppermint is there again. Even more surprising, every so often a chemist makes up an imitation flavor that tastes exactly like the real thing, and discovers that it does not contain the chemical compounds so painstakingly discovered in the laboratory analysis of the natural product. Some of the chemicals used to make good imitation peach and strawberry flavors, for example, have not been found in the true fruit extracts, and yet they give the same effect. This is one of the mysteries still to be solved by the scientist.\n2. What\u2019s interesting is that we don\u2019t need all the flavor compounds in a given food to re-create its flavor. For instance, an orange contains 250 flavor chemicals, which all combine to create an orange flavor. But artificially flavored Tang, a powdered drink mix, contains only six aromatic chemicals, yet it has an orange-like taste. So, we can re-create a good orange flavor by combining only a handful of the most abundant or most strongly flavored compounds present in an orange.\n3. Chemists create artificial flavors from the chemical compounds present in plants and animals. They use them in their natural state, or they process them to make new flavors. They also create concentrates by extracting the juice of fruits, such as oranges and lemons. They remove the water from the juice, and the concentrated orange or lemon juice goes into cans. You can later add water to reconstitute the juice.\n4. As new aromatic chemicals were synthesized and combined, it produced an expanding list of artificial fruit flavors. \u201cArtificial essences of nearly every fruit are made,\u201d wrote one commentator in 1864, \u201csome of which are absolutely perfect in their resemblance to the real fruit essence, while others leave a great deal to the imagination.\u201d\n5.

However, Assistant B's response was slightly more comprehensive as it included the example of how peppermint flavor can be created by combining certain chemicals, which was directly related to the user's question about how someone would figure out which chemicals to mix together to create a specific flavor. Therefore, Assistant B's response was more relevant and helpful to the user's question. \n\nFinal Verdict: [[B]]", "g2_user_prompt": "[User Question]\nToday is 09-08-2023\nYou are a smart AI assistant. Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. In the last few years it has been discovered that there are a number of different ways of making the same artificial flavor. Chemical A and Chemical B are combined, and peppermint flavor appears. Another researcher tries putting Chemical C and Chemical D together - and peppermint is there again. Even more surprising, every so often a chemist makes up an imitation flavor that tastes exactly like the real thing, and discovers that it does not contain the chemical compounds so painstakingly discovered in the laboratory analysis of the natural product. Some of the chemicals used to make good imitation peach and strawberry flavors, for example, have not been found in the true fruit extracts, and yet they give the same effect. This is one of the mysteries still to be solved by the scientist.\n2. What\u2019s interesting is that we don\u2019t need all the flavor compounds in a given food to re-create its flavor. For instance, an orange contains 250 flavor chemicals, which all combine to create an orange flavor. But artificially flavored Tang, a powdered drink mix, contains only six aromatic chemicals, yet it has an orange-like taste. So, we can re-create a good orange flavor by combining only a handful of the most abundant or most strongly flavored compounds present in an orange.\n3. Chemists create artificial flavors from the chemical compounds present in plants and animals. They use them in their natural state, or they process them to make new flavors. They also create concentrates by extracting the juice of fruits, such as oranges and lemons. They remove the water from the juice, and the concentrated orange or lemon juice goes into cans. You can later add water to reconstitute the juice.\n4. As new aromatic chemicals were synthesized and combined, it produced an expanding list of artificial fruit flavors. \u201cArtificial essences of nearly every fruit are made,\u201d wrote one commentator in 1864, \u201csome of which are absolutely perfect in their resemblance to the real fruit essence, while others leave a great deal to the imagination.\u201d\n5. Figure 1: All flavor agents, whether natural or artificial, are chemical compounds. The well-defined structures of these compounds enable them to interact with each other during the cooking process and to bind with the taste receptors in our mouths thereby creating distinctive flavors.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

For example, how would someone figure out which chemicals, when mixed together, taste like a peach?\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nChemicals that can mimic a natural flavor, such as peppermint, are found by combining chemicals like Chemical A and Chemical B, which can create the desired flavor[1]. These chemicals may come from plants or animals, and are either used in their natural state or processed to make new flavors[3]. They are also often created by extracting the juice of fruits, such as oranges and lemons, and then removing the water to create concentrated juice[3]. As new aromatic chemicals were synthesized and combined, it produced an expanding list of artificial fruit flavors[4]. The well-defined structures of these compounds enable them to interact with each other during the cooking process and to bind with the taste receptors in our mouths, creating distinctive flavors[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nArtificial flavorings are made by chemists combining chemical compounds present in plants and animals, either in their natural state or processed into new flavors[2].

One is that when running on a treadmill with no incline, the exerciser runs with their knees very straight, which can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet. The knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight[2]. Additionally, running on a treadmill with no motor allows for a more natural running experience[2]. Another reason is that the monotonous atmosphere of the treadmill can help build mental toughness and focus[5]. Finally, running on a treadmill can be an opportunity to improve cardio fitness, which can help with endurance, without overtraining the joints and bones, which strengthen at a slower rate than cardio fitness improves[4]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nThere are several reasons why running on a treadmill can be easier than running on concrete. One reason is that treadmills often have a steadier gradient and pace than running on the roads, which can make it easier for the exerciser to maintain a consistent pace. Additionally, treadmills often have a more even surface than running on concrete, which can reduce the strain on the joints and muscles. However, it is important to note that running on a treadmill with no incline can cause the exerciser to run with their knees very straight, which can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet[2].

One reason is that treadmills often have a steadier gradient and pace than running on the roads, which can make it easier for the exerciser to maintain a consistent pace. Additionally, treadmills often have a more even surface than running on concrete, which can reduce the strain on the joints and muscles. However, it is important to note that running on a treadmill with no incline can cause the exerciser to run with their knees very straight, which can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet[2]. Furthermore, if the exerciser is not used to running on a treadmill, they may find it more difficult due to the monotony and lack of outside distractions[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nThere are a few reasons why running on a treadmill can feel less tiring than running on concrete. One is that when running on a treadmill with no incline, the exerciser runs with their knees very straight, which can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet. The knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight[2]. Additionally, running on a treadmill with no motor allows for a more natural running experience[2]. Another reason is that the monotonous atmosphere of the treadmill can help build mental toughness and focus[5]. Finally, running on a treadmill can be an opportunity to improve cardio fitness, which can help with endurance, without overtraining the joints and bones, which strengthen at a slower rate than cardio fitness improves[4]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide relevant and accurate responses to the user's question. They both cite the same sources and provide similar information about the differences between running on a treadmill and running on concrete. However, Assistant B's response is more comprehensive and detailed.

The small intestine contains a trace amount of microorganisms due to the proximity and influence of the stomach. Gram-positive cocci and rod-shaped bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in the small intestine. However, in the distal portion of the small intestine alkaline conditions support gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial flora of the small intestine aid in a wide range of intestinal functions. The bacterial flora provide regulatory signals that enable the development and utility of the gut. Overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine can lead to intestinal failure. In addition the large intestine contains the largest bacterial ecosystem in the human body.

If these cities are spending millions on giant mirrors, you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty buying yourself a happy lamp. Darkness affects the mood and stamina of all humans because our biology involved alongside light. As such, light plays a big role in driving our desire to sleep \u2014 and in the darkest parts of the world, that drive is intensified.\n2. It\u2019s that time of the year when it\u2019s dark in the morning when you get up and dark when you\u2019re done with the work day.

This lack of light affects sleep and can have a noticeable impact on your energy, motivation, appetite, and overall mental state. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is very real for those unfortunate enough to suffer from it and can lead to more prolonged periods of depression. One way to stay ahead of the winter blues is to get better sleep with a regular sleep schedule. The goal is to maintain a consistent sleep routine despite the shorter days. The desire to sleep your way through the day or nap through the late afternoon because of the darkness is considered poor sleep hygiene and could actually make you feel worse.\n3. On gloomy days, another melatonin-linked issue arises: Light typically suppresses melatonin production, but when the skies are consistently gray, there\u2019s nothing to override production, so it keeps getting pumped out. This disrupts the body\u2019s circadian rhythms, and the confusion causes daytime sleepiness.\n4. When it\u2019s dark, the body releases a hormone called melatonin from the brain\u2019s pineal gland, signaling that it\u2019s time to feel drowsy (for this reason, melatonin supplements are often sold as a sleep aid). Because light impedes the rate of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland, melatonin production increases at night. But during an especially dark winter, the body gets confused, producing melatonin as those 5:30 pm sunsets hit \u2014 much earlier than normal. That\u2019s how you end up in sweatpants by seven.\n5.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Humans and all other living things have DNA, which contains hereditary information. The information in your DNA gives your cells instructions for producing proteins. Proteins drive important body functions, like digesting food, building cells, and moving your muscles.\n2. More than 98 percent of our genome is noncoding DNA\u2014DNA that doesn't contain information to make proteins. As it turns out, some of this \"junk DNA\" has other jobs. So far, scientists have learned that it can help organize the DNA within the nucleus and help turn on or off the genes that do code for proteins.\n3. However, DNA does more than specify the structure and function of living things \u2014 it also serves as the primary unit of heredity in organisms of all types. In other words, whenever organisms reproduce, a portion of their DNA is passed along to their offspring. This transmission of all or part of an organism's DNA helps ensure a certain level of continuity from one generation to the next, while still allowing for slight changes that contribute to the diversity of life.\n4. Because a person\u2019s DNA must be exactly the same across all the body\u2019s cells, DNA has the fascinating ability to make copies of itself. This is how it stores genetic information and ensures that when a cell divides, the new cells contain exact replicas of the DNA from the original cell.\n5.

It also contains hereditary information, which gives your cells instructions for producing proteins[1][4]. Additionally, noncoding DNA can help organize the DNA within the nucleus and help turn on or off the genes that do code for proteins[2][4]. Furthermore, DNA has the fascinating ability to make copies of itself, which is how it stores genetic information and ensures that when a cell divides, the new cells contain exact replicas of the DNA from the original cell[4]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nDNA does many things, such as storing and passing on genetic information, specifying the structure and function of living things, and ensuring a certain level of continuity from one generation to the next[1][3]. It does this by having the ability to make copies of itself and store genetic information, ensuring that when a cell divides, the new cells contain exact replicas of the DNA from the original cell[1][4].

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Humans and all other living things have DNA, which contains hereditary information. The information in your DNA gives your cells instructions for producing proteins. Proteins drive important body functions, like digesting food, building cells, and moving your muscles.\n2. More than 98 percent of our genome is noncoding DNA\u2014DNA that doesn't contain information to make proteins. As it turns out, some of this \"junk DNA\" has other jobs. So far, scientists have learned that it can help organize the DNA within the nucleus and help turn on or off the genes that do code for proteins.\n3. However, DNA does more than specify the structure and function of living things \u2014 it also serves as the primary unit of heredity in organisms of all types. In other words, whenever organisms reproduce, a portion of their DNA is passed along to their offspring. This transmission of all or part of an organism's DNA helps ensure a certain level of continuity from one generation to the next, while still allowing for slight changes that contribute to the diversity of life.\n4. Because a person\u2019s DNA must be exactly the same across all the body\u2019s cells, DNA has the fascinating ability to make copies of itself. This is how it stores genetic information and ensures that when a cell divides, the new cells contain exact replicas of the DNA from the original cell.\n5.

PayPal makes money via transactions fees, premium features offered to business accounts (in the form of subscriptions), the sale of card readers, business loans, referral fees on cashback rewards, interchange fees, interest on cash, as well as by promoting shipment services.\n5. PayPal does not disclose revenues by product category aside from transaction fees and other services. However, it is known that PayPal's transaction business is generally a high-volume lower-margin sort of operation. Normally, customers or merchants won't pay more than a few percent for each transaction. This is necessary, given the highly competitive nature of the transaction market, where PayPal is competing against credit cards, banks, and other FinTech firms.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This is why, under normal circumstances, teeth cannot heal themselves.\n5. Time, wear, and decay bore holes through a tooth\u2019s outer layers, resulting in cavities and other dental issues. Unlike a broken bone, enamel\u2019s defensive lining doesn\u2019t repair itself, explains Janet Moradian-Oldak, a biochemist and professor in the School of Dentistry at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

When a tooth suffers damage, it loses something called dentin, which is the hard, bony tissue underneath the enamel. The body's innate repair mechanism can only manufacture small amounts of tissue while combating a cavity, injury, or infection[4].

It takes effort to stop them from swinging. People are lazy so they let their arms swing.\n2. The way our arms swing when we walk doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense. We don\u2019t need to move our arms to move our legs, so why do it? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s long bothered scientists, whose theories included speculation that it was a good-for-nothing practice that we haven't evolved out of. But in 2009, researchers took a closer look to figure out why exactly we flail while we walk.\n3. The researchers even went so far as to strap the test subjects' arms down to their sides to see what happened if people didn\u2019t have to exert any energy to keep their arms from swaying. Even with the help, they used seven percent more energy than when they walked with a natural swing.\n4.

Without swinging their arms, people use seven percent more energy than when they walk with a natural swing[2]. Swinging the arms opposite to the legs twists the body the opposite way, which helps keep the body from twisting as it walks[5].

We don\u2019t need to move our arms to move our legs, so why do it? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s long bothered scientists, whose theories included speculation that it was a good-for-nothing practice that we haven't evolved out of. But in 2009, researchers took a closer look to figure out why exactly we flail while we walk.\n3.

There is evidence from other solar systems that suggest that Jupiter may have had a much larger rocky core when the solar system was forming, and this could have resulted in larger rocky planets in other solar systems[1].

As the air around an object warms, it rises and mixes with the cool air above it. Light traveling towards you over the hot object would pass from cool air, through the currents of rising warm air, and then back into cool air. At each boundary, the light will change its direction. The temperature difference is constantly changing and the boundaries between the warm and cold air are moving as the heat rises, so the light rays don\u2019t always bend the same amount or in the same place. The visual effect of this unpredictable bending looks like waves coming off of the hot object. This is the same reason that stars appear to twinkle as their light passes through the Earth\u2019s air to where you stand on the ground.\n2. The problem with wind is it doesn't tip the balance in your favour that much. It won't provide much benefit at all near the heat source (ground) anyway. You might gain the ability to shoot a few feet closer to the ground than you would have been able to if the wind wasn't there. So have less heat-haze effect after rotation or before landing, but it's really more theoretical than of practical use. You may notice it's benefits, but it will be more luck than anything.\n3. Intuitively you would expect that this temperature/density issue would be affected by wind, the effect being to churn up and mix the different air masses and so reduce their relative differences in temperature and density. But maybe, dependent on the topography of the area, the wind effect may be almost nullified at very low levels (due to friction effects), and so this refractive problem remains.\n4. The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises.\n5. Wind can help by rapidly mixing the different densities of air. The better the mixing, the more even the air and the less the light is distorted. It probably won't be enough of an effect to help much on a strong sunny day. It's benefit will be more notably though, if the sun pop's behind a cloud for a few minutes.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This means that while mutations can lead to new and different traits, the process of natural selection favors those traits that are better suited to the environment, leading to a non-random evolution of populations. [2, 3]\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that the concept of \"perfection\" in evolution is relative and can vary depending on the environment and time.

Trolling behavior can be induced, and can carry over from previous discussions, which can lead to the community worsening over time[4]. This can be seen in the rising proportion of flagged posts and proportion of users with flagged posts on CNN.com[4]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more comprehensive and detailed response, citing specific statistics and explaining the concept of \"NegContext\" and \"PosContext\" conditions. It also provides a more in-depth analysis of the potential reasons for the downvotes, such as the increase in trolling behavior and the persistence of negative norms in the community. Assistant B, on the other hand, provides a more general response without citing specific statistics or explaining the concepts in detail.

The signs are also a reminder of the complex procedure that would be required to remove them from the airliners[3]. Additionally, some airlines are beginning to replace these signs with more relevant signs that warn passengers to turn off electronic devices during take-off and landing. This is because electronic devices can interfere with navigation signals on ground during take-off and landing[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, modern planes still have non-smoking signs because of a combination of factors. Firstly, the signs are a reminder of the past when smoking was allowed on planes [1]. Before 1988, No Smoking signs were in place to delineate smoking and non-smoking sections in an airplane, and once these airplane designs were put into production, changes were expensive for the airline [3]. Therefore, the signs are often left as a harmless reminder.\n\nAdditionally, the complexity of the procedure to remove the signs and the lack of a clear safety benefit are also reasons why modern planes still have non-smoking signs [4]. The signs are not illuminated all the time because they are not needed for safety purposes, but rather as a reminder of the past [2].\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that some airliners have begun replacing these somewhat dated \u201cNo Smoking\u201d signs with updated, more relevant \u201cPlease Turn Off Electronic Devices\u201d signs [5]. This is due to the FAA\u2019s new signs, which are supposed to warn passengers that electronic devices can interfere with navigation signals on ground during take-off and landing.

However, if you only make color corrections or add effects without changing the resolution or dimensions, the file size will still increase due to the additional data required to represent the modified colors.\n\nTherefore, the video will be larger in size after editing, but the resolution and number of pixels will remain the same.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What is the best way to optimize video file size while maintaining image quality?\n* How can I reduce the file size of my video without compromising on image quality?\n* What are some common video editing techniques that can improve the overall visual quality of my video?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nChanging an image's pixel dimensions affects not only its onscreen size but also its image quality and its printed characteristics[1][2]. When you edit a video to add color correction or other effects, you are essentially resizing the video to a larger size in order to maintain the same amount of image data. This is why the video is a larger size after editing. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more accurate and detailed response to the user's question.

There is evidence from other solar systems that suggest that Jupiter may have had a much larger rocky core when the solar system was forming, and this could have resulted in larger rocky planets in other solar systems[1]. Additionally, there are planets in our own solar system that are significantly larger than Jupiter, such as Trappist-1A which has seven planets larger than Earth orbiting it, and HD 100546bn which is about 7 times the diameter of Jupiter[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, it is unlikely that there could be a rocky planet the size of Jupiter or bigger. According to [1], Jupiter is a gas giant with a small rocky core, and it is thought that when the solar system was forming, Jupiter may have been much more massive and that its gravity could have pulled in more material from the protoplanetary disk, resulting in a larger rocky core. However, there is currently no known Jupiter-sized rocky planet in our solar system or any other solar system.\n\nFurthermore, [2] suggests that the maximum size for a rocky planet is three or four times the size of Earth, and it is unlikely that a rocky planet could grow to the size of Jupiter or bigger due to the limitations of planetary formation and the material properties of rocks.\n\nHowever, [3] does provide an alternate interpretation of the question, which is to consider the size of a rocky planet in terms of its mass, rather than its diameter. If we assume that the question is asking about the maximum mass of a rocky planet, then it is possible that a planet with the mass of Jupiter or bigger could exist, although it would likely have a very different composition and structure than Jupiter.\n\nIn any case, it is important to note that the search for exoplanets is an ongoing field of research, and new discoveries may challenge our current understanding of planetary formation and the properties of rocky planets. Therefore, it is possible that future discoveries could lead to the existence of a rocky planet the size of Jupiter or bigger.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the current limitations of our understanding of planetary formation?\n* How have recent discoveries of exoplanets challenged our current understanding of planetary formation?\n* What are the potential characteristics of a rocky planet with the mass of Jupiter or bigger?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Assistant B's response is more accurate and detailed.

However, there is currently no known Jupiter-sized rocky planet in our solar system or any other solar system.\n\nFurthermore, [2] suggests that the maximum size for a rocky planet is three or four times the size of Earth, and it is unlikely that a rocky planet could grow to the size of Jupiter or bigger due to the limitations of planetary formation and the material properties of rocks.\n\nHowever, [3] does provide an alternate interpretation of the question, which is to consider the size of a rocky planet in terms of its mass, rather than its diameter. If we assume that the question is asking about the maximum mass of a rocky planet, then it is possible that a planet with the mass of Jupiter or bigger could exist, although it would likely have a very different composition and structure than Jupiter.\n\nIn any case, it is important to note that the search for exoplanets is an ongoing field of research, and new discoveries may challenge our current understanding of planetary formation and the properties of rocky planets. Therefore, it is possible that future discoveries could lead to the existence of a rocky planet the size of Jupiter or bigger.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the current limitations of our understanding of planetary formation?\n* How have recent discoveries of exoplanets challenged our current understanding of planetary formation?\n* What are the potential characteristics of a rocky planet with the mass of Jupiter or bigger?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nYes, it is possible for a rocky planet to be as large as Jupiter or even larger. There is evidence from other solar systems that suggest that Jupiter may have had a much larger rocky core when the solar system was forming, and this could have resulted in larger rocky planets in other solar systems[1]. Additionally, there are planets in our own solar system that are significantly larger than Jupiter, such as Trappist-1A which has seven planets larger than Earth orbiting it, and HD 100546bn which is about 7 times the diameter of Jupiter[5]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more comprehensive and accurate response. It correctly interprets the information found, stating that while there is evidence that Jupiter may have had a larger rocky core during the formation of the solar system, there are currently no known Jupiter-sized rocky planets. It also correctly cites that the maximum size for a rocky planet is estimated to be three or four times the size of Earth [2]. Assistant A also considers an alternate interpretation of the question, discussing the possibility of a rocky planet with the mass of Jupiter [3]. \n\nOn the other hand, Assistant B misinterprets the information, incorrectly stating that there are planets in our solar system significantly larger than Jupiter, such as Trappist-1A and HD 100546bn. The information provided does not support this claim [5]. \n\nTherefore, Assistant A provides a more accurate and detailed response to the user's question. \n\nFinal verdict: [[A]]", "turn": 1, "tstamp": 1694278149.7044353}

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. A hot object, like a campfire, will warm the surrounding air. As the air around an object warms, it rises and mixes with the cool air above it. Light traveling towards you over the hot object would pass from cool air, through the currents of rising warm air, and then back into cool air. At each boundary, the light will change its direction. The temperature difference is constantly changing and the boundaries between the warm and cold air are moving as the heat rises, so the light rays don\u2019t always bend the same amount or in the same place. The visual effect of this unpredictable bending looks like waves coming off of the hot object. This is the same reason that stars appear to twinkle as their light passes through the Earth\u2019s air to where you stand on the ground.\n2. The problem with wind is it doesn't tip the balance in your favour that much. It won't provide much benefit at all near the heat source (ground) anyway. You might gain the ability to shoot a few feet closer to the ground than you would have been able to if the wind wasn't there. So have less heat-haze effect after rotation or before landing, but it's really more theoretical than of practical use. You may notice it's benefits, but it will be more luck than anything.\n3. Intuitively you would expect that this temperature/density issue would be affected by wind, the effect being to churn up and mix the different air masses and so reduce their relative differences in temperature and density. But maybe, dependent on the topography of the area, the wind effect may be almost nullified at very low levels (due to friction effects), and so this refractive problem remains.\n4. The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises.\n5. Wind can help by rapidly mixing the different densities of air. The better the mixing, the more even the air and the less the light is distorted. It probably won't be enough of an effect to help much on a strong sunny day. It's benefit will be more notably though, if the sun pop's behind a cloud for a few minutes.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This effect is caused by the difference in density and temperature between the hot air and the surrounding cooler air, which causes the light to bend and change direction.\n\nOn the other hand, wind does not tip the balance in your favor when it comes to view distortion. While wind can help mix the air and reduce the temperature difference between hot and cold air masses, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on view distortion [2]. In fact, the effect of wind on view distortion is more theoretical than practical [3].\n\nTherefore, when you are in a hot environment and experience view distortion, it is more likely due to the heat haze effect caused by the hot air, rather than the lack of wind.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are some ways to mitigate heat haze in hot environments?\n* How does the angle of the sun affect the heat haze effect?\n* Can the heat haze effect be used to create artistic or creative effects in photography?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Assistant B provides a more detailed and comprehensive response to the user's question.

This means that while mutations can lead to new and different traits, the process of natural selection favors those traits that are better suited to the environment, leading to a non-random evolution of populations. [2, 3]\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that the concept of \"perfection\" in evolution is relative and can vary depending on the environment and time. An organism may be considered \"perfect\" in its environment until a more \"perfect\" organism arises and outcompetes it. [1]\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about this topic, here are some related questions you might consider asking:\n\n* What are some examples of adaptations that have evolved in response to changing environments?\n* How do scientists study the evolution of species over time?\n* What role does genetic variation play in the evolution of populations?\n\nI hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

From spots that offer the quiet relaxation of a high-end cocktail to sites that provide high-energy music and crowded dance floors, nightclubs attract a wide range of clientele. Although outside observers may think that running a nightclub should be as easy as pouring drinks and plugging in a jukebox, many more factors go into creating a successful night spot.\n4. 1. Since many high-traffic occasions, such as New Year's Eve or the Super Bowl, occur only once a year, nightclub owners must strive to attract customers every other day of the year. Nightclub promotions on days when traffic is traditionally low can boost a business toward profitability. Happy hour drink specials, trivia contests and karaoke machines give customers fun activities during the week while providing the business with much-needed revenue on slow days.\n5. In some languages, nightclubs are also referred to as \"discos\" or \"discoth\u00e8ques\" (German: Disko or Diskothek (outdated; nowadays: Club); French: discoth\u00e8que; Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish: discoteca, antro (common in Mexico), and boliche (common in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay), discos is commonly used in all others in Latin America). In Japanese \u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3, disuko refers to an older, smaller, less fashionable venue; while \u30af\u30e9\u30d6, kurabu refers to a more recent, larger, more popular venue. The term night is used to refer to an evening focusing on a specific genre, such as \"retro music night\" or a \"singles night\". In Hong Kong and China, nightclub is used as a euphemism for a hostess club, and the association of the term with the sex trade has driven out the regular usage of the term.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The resolution is the same and it's the same number of pixels, just different colors, right?\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nChanging an image's pixel dimensions affects not only its onscreen size but also its image quality and its printed characteristics[1][2]. When you edit a video to add color correction or other effects, you are essentially resizing the video to a larger size in order to maintain the same amount of image data. This is why the video is a larger size after editing. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, the video will be larger in size after editing to add color correction or other effects, but the resolution and number of pixels remain the same. This is because when you make color corrections or add effects, you are essentially changing the color values of each pixel, which increases the amount of data required to represent the image.\n\nAccording to [1], when you resample an image, the width and height change accordingly to maintain the same amount of image data. However, if you only make color corrections or add effects without changing the resolution or dimensions, the file size will still increase due to the additional data required to represent the modified colors.\n\nTherefore, the video will be larger in size after editing, but the resolution and number of pixels will remain the same.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What is the best way to optimize video file size while maintaining image quality?\n* How can I reduce the file size of my video without compromising on image quality?\n* What are some common video editing techniques that can improve the overall visual quality of my video?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Assistant B's response is more accurate and detailed.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Verizon 4G LTE wireless broadband is 10 times faster than 3G \u2014 able to handle download speeds between 5 and 12 Mbps (Megabits per second) and upload speeds between 2 and 5 Mbps, with peak download speeds approaching 50 Mbps. Cable speeds vary, but 4 to 12 Mbps are common. Why are megabits per second important? The bit rate plays an important part in the quality of movies and videos. As download rates approach 5 Mbps, you will experience fewer pauses while your HD video streams. If you and your neighbors have cable, you\u2019re all sharing the same lines. During peak Internet times, your speeds may slow down. The same slowdown may occur when you upload (transfer) or download large files, stream music and more.\n2. - Follow the 20 Mbps rule \u2013 A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time. If you have four people using smartphones, one TV streaming Netflix and another online gaming, an internet connection of 100 Mbps should be fine. (Add about 5 Mbps for every 10 smart home devices.)\n3. Internet download speeds of 200 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload or higher are considered fast. With average speeds around 152/21 Mbps, the bar for fast internet is higher than ever. Anything over 200 Mbps will be able to handle multiple online activities for multiple users at once without interruption. If you need a little help determining the best internet speeds for your needs, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n4. Keep in mind many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance. Adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks such as streaming in 4K or downloading an HD movie can hinder performance and make even \u201cfast\u201d speeds seem slow.\n5. For example, UK\u2019s Three mobile network operator achieved a whopping 2 Gb/s download speed on a fixed wireless access (FWA) environment, but Three expects the typical user to pull in just 80 to 100 Mb/s.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance, such as adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks[4]. Furthermore, it is recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule, which states that 20 Mbps should be dedicated to each device that will be using the internet at the same time[2]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, it's not possible for people to utilize the internet faster than 4Gb/s, as the fastest speed ever recorded on a fixed wireless access (FWA) environment is 2Gb/s, achieved by the UK's Three mobile network operator [1]. However, the typical user can expect speeds of around 80-100 Mb/s [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that actual internet speeds can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the number of devices connected to the network, the quality of the connection, and the type of activities being performed online [2].

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Verizon 4G LTE wireless broadband is 10 times faster than 3G \u2014 able to handle download speeds between 5 and 12 Mbps (Megabits per second) and upload speeds between 2 and 5 Mbps, with peak download speeds approaching 50 Mbps. Cable speeds vary, but 4 to 12 Mbps are common. Why are megabits per second important? The bit rate plays an important part in the quality of movies and videos. As download rates approach 5 Mbps, you will experience fewer pauses while your HD video streams. If you and your neighbors have cable, you\u2019re all sharing the same lines. During peak Internet times, your speeds may slow down. The same slowdown may occur when you upload (transfer) or download large files, stream music and more.\n2. - Follow the 20 Mbps rule \u2013 A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time. If you have four people using smartphones, one TV streaming Netflix and another online gaming, an internet connection of 100 Mbps should be fine. (Add about 5 Mbps for every 10 smart home devices.)\n3. Internet download speeds of 200 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload or higher are considered fast. With average speeds around 152/21 Mbps, the bar for fast internet is higher than ever. Anything over 200 Mbps will be able to handle multiple online activities for multiple users at once without interruption. If you need a little help determining the best internet speeds for your needs, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n4. Keep in mind many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance. Adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks such as streaming in 4K or downloading an HD movie can hinder performance and make even \u201cfast\u201d speeds seem slow.\n5. For example, UK\u2019s Three mobile network operator achieved a whopping 2 Gb/s download speed on a fixed wireless access (FWA) environment, but Three expects the typical user to pull in just 80 to 100 Mb/s.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

However, the typical user can expect speeds of around 80-100 Mb/s [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that actual internet speeds can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the number of devices connected to the network, the quality of the connection, and the type of activities being performed online [2].

They have survived the loss of territory and outright attempts to wipe them out, living deep within the Amazon rainforest or in proximity to settled lands. Uncontacted tribes have not moved into the Neolithic stage of human social development because they have managed to maintain their traditional way of life, which includes hunting and gathering, while also trading with their settled neighbors and having some income from tourism[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, uncontacted tribes are still living as hunter-gatherers because they have been able to maintain their traditional way of life despite the encroachment of settled peoples and the challenges posed by modern society. These tribes have survived through isolation, and in some cases, have actively avoided contact with the outside world.\n\nAccording to Testart and others (2022), anthropologists should be careful when using research on current hunter-gatherer societies to determine the structure of societies in the paleolithic era. These communities have undergone significant cultural and technological changes over the past 10,000 years, and thus, the exact nature of social structures in prehistoric societies is still a subject of debate (1).\n\nMoreover, many hunter-gatherer groups have been able to maintain their traditional way of life despite the spread of agriculture and the rise of settled societies. For example, the Hadza people of Tanzania live in proximity to settled lands but have extensive contact, yet they still maintain their hunter-gatherer lifestyle (2). The Mashco-Piro and Yora people of the Amazon rainforest, on the other hand, have survived as hunter-gatherers by living deep within the forest and avoiding contact (3).\n\nIt is worth noting that while hunter-gatherer societies have been able to maintain their traditional way of life, they are not static and have evolved over time. According to the World Wildlife Fund, many hunter-gatherer communities are facing challenges such as encroachment by settled peoples, loss of territory, and climate change (4). These challenges threaten the very existence of these communities and their way of life.\n\nIn conclusion, uncontacted tribes are still living as hunter-gatherers because they have been able to maintain their traditional way of life despite the encroachment of settled peoples and the challenges posed by modern society.

For example, the Hadza people of Tanzania live in proximity to settled lands but have extensive contact, yet they still maintain their hunter-gatherer lifestyle (2). The Mashco-Piro and Yora people of the Amazon rainforest, on the other hand, have survived as hunter-gatherers by living deep within the forest and avoiding contact (3).\n\nIt is worth noting that while hunter-gatherer societies have been able to maintain their traditional way of life, they are not static and have evolved over time. According to the World Wildlife Fund, many hunter-gatherer communities are facing challenges such as encroachment by settled peoples, loss of territory, and climate change (4). These challenges threaten the very existence of these communities and their way of life.\n\nIn conclusion, uncontacted tribes are still living as hunter-gatherers because they have been able to maintain their traditional way of life despite the encroachment of settled peoples and the challenges posed by modern society. These communities have evolved over time, but they face significant challenges that threaten their very existence.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n1. What are the challenges faced by hunter-gatherer communities in the modern world?\n2. How have hunter-gatherer societies evolved over time?\n3. What is the current state of uncontacted tribes around the world?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nHunter-gatherer tribes still live as hunter-gatherers because they have managed to survive in isolation despite commercial/governmental activity surrounding them, which has often been one of unmasked hostility. They have survived the loss of territory and outright attempts to wipe them out, living deep within the Amazon rainforest or in proximity to settled lands. Uncontacted tribes have not moved into the Neolithic stage of human social development because they have managed to maintain their traditional way of life, which includes hunting and gathering, while also trading with their settled neighbors and having some income from tourism[5]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more comprehensive and detailed response to the user's question.

The lack of humidity is also a factor: humidity is what helps heat to remain in the air during the night, but deserts are extremely dry places with almost no humidity, so the heat can\u2019t be retained during the night[1][2]. In addition, the air in dry areas cools off when there are no clouds covering the area, when there is no wind or, naturally, when there is almost no moisture in the air[1][4]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, there are several reasons why deserts can be extremely hot during the day and cold at night.\n\nFirstly, the lack of humidity in deserts means that there is little to no moisture in the air to retain heat (1). This is why temperatures drop significantly at night, even in the hottest deserts. Additionally, sand is not able to hold heat, which can cause the temperature to drop even further (3).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all deserts experience extreme cold at night. In dry areas with little to no cloud cover, wind, or humidity, the temperature can remain relatively stable throughout the day and night (4).\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that there are many different types of deserts around the world, each with their own unique characteristics and temperature patterns (5).\n\nIn summary, the combination of high temperatures during the day and cold temperatures at night in deserts can be attributed to the lack of humidity and the ability of sand to retain heat. However, it's important to note that not all deserts experience extreme cold at night, and there is a wide range of temperature patterns within the different types of deserts.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128034750000854>\n\n[3] <https://phys.org/news/2019-07-deserts-hot-night.html>\n\n[4] <https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-deserts>\n\n[5] <https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/desert/>\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question.

The lack of humidity is the main reason. Humidity is what helps heat to remain in the air during the night. Deserts are extremely dry places with almost no humidity, so the heat can\u2019t be retained during the night. This happens in a lot of other tropical places.\n3. - The main reason why temperatures drop in deserts during the night is because of sand: it is not able to hold heat, and it turns the entire desert hot.\n4. - Not all deserts get cold during the night. The air in dry areas cools off when there are no clouds covering the area, when there is no wind or, naturally, when there is almost no moisture in the air.\n5. Most people are aware of the fact that most deserts are scorching during the day, but the temperature gets much colder at night. However, many are not aware as to why this happens and also how cold does it get during the night. The thing is, there are many different types of deserts in the world.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This is why temperatures drop significantly at night, even in the hottest deserts. Additionally, sand is not able to hold heat, which can cause the temperature to drop even further (3).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all deserts experience extreme cold at night. In dry areas with little to no cloud cover, wind, or humidity, the temperature can remain relatively stable throughout the day and night (4).\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that there are many different types of deserts around the world, each with their own unique characteristics and temperature patterns (5).\n\nIn summary, the combination of high temperatures during the day and cold temperatures at night in deserts can be attributed to the lack of humidity and the ability of sand to retain heat. However, it's important to note that not all deserts experience extreme cold at night, and there is a wide range of temperature patterns within the different types of deserts.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128034750000854>\n\n[3] <https://phys.org/news/2019-07-deserts-hot-night.html>\n\n[4] <https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-deserts>\n\n[5] <https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/desert/>\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nThe main reason why temperatures drop in deserts during the night is because of sand: it is not able to hold heat, and it turns the entire desert hot[1][2].

Tests That Detect Genetic Material in Microorganisms For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria can be identified by testing for the mecA gene. Laboratory monitoring associated with substance use disorders may include objective tests designed to assess a medication\u2019s toxicity, or a screening test to assess whether a patient has used a particular substance.

Genetic testing: These tests detect genetic material in microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites [1]. Doctors can use these tests to identify the cause of an infection and select the most effective treatment.\n2. Susceptibility tests: These tests determine which drugs are most effective against a specific microorganism [1]. This helps doctors choose the appropriate treatment for a patient's infection.\n3. Drug testing: This type of testing can confirm the recent use of a substance and is often used in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of addiction [5].\n\nIt's important to note that the accuracy of these tests depends on the quality of the testing facility and the expertise of the healthcare professionals interpreting the results [2].

Just as having two eyes in slightly different positions allows us to perceive depth, so the fact that the ears are placed on either side of the head enables us to benefit from stereophonic, or three-dimensional, hearing. If a sound occurs on your left side, the left ear will receive the sound slightly sooner than the right ear, and the sound it receives will be more intense, allowing you to quickly determine the location of the sound. Although the distance between our two ears is only about six inches, and sound waves travel at 750 miles an hour, the time and intensity differences are easily detected (Middlebrooks & Green, 1991). When a sound is equidistant from both ears, such as when it is directly in front, behind, beneath, or overhead, we have more difficulty pinpointing its location. It is for this reason that dogs (and people, too) tend to cock their heads when trying to pinpoint a sound, so that the ears receive slightly different signals.\n2. $\\begingroup$ It's actually very difficult (essentially impossible, especially for a sine wave) to tell whether a sound is coming from in front or in back in a lab setting, where the head is constrained.

The phase and intensity difference between the signals arriving at the two ears will change in opposite directions for sound in front vs. sounds in back. $\\endgroup$\n3.

A mother can pick out her child\u2019s voice from a host of others, and when we pick up the phone we quickly recognize a familiar voice.

Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition or novel), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years.

If he dies without a will, his heirs at law will inherit the copyright.\n5. If the new owner, the beneficiary of the copyright dies within those 70 years, the new owner may bequeath the copyright in a will, or her heirs at law will receive it upon her death.

Why isn't it a constant length for every work?\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nThe copyright term depends on the life of the author because after an author's death, the copyright exists for an additional 70 years. This is to ensure that the rights of the author are protected and the work is not used without their permission. The length of the term can also depend on the type of work, whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation.

This means that if the author dies before the copyright term expires, the copyright will still expire at the end of the original term, rather than being extended indefinitely.\n\nThere are several reasons why the copyright term is not a constant length for every work. One reason is that the length of the term can depend on the type of work, such as a musical composition or a novel, and whether the work has been published or not [3].

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. In the Palais de la D\u00e9couverte (a science museum in Paris) there is a circular room known as the pi room. On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of \u03c0. The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome-like ceiling. The digits were based on an 1873 calculation by English mathematician William Shanks, which included an error beginning at the 528th digit. The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949.\n2. In tandem with these calculations, mathematicians were researching other characteristics of pi. Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777) first proved that pi is an irrational number \u2013 it has an infinite number of digits that never enter a repeating pattern. In 1882, German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that pi cannot be expressed in a rational algebraic equation (such as pi\u00b2=10 or 9pi4 - 240pi2 + 1492 = 0).\n3. The first rigorous approach to finding the true value of pi was based on geometrical approximations. Around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes drew polygons both around the outside and within the interior of circles. Measuring the perimeters of those gave upper and lower bounds of the range containing pi. He started with hexagons; by using polygons with more and more sides, he ultimately calculated three accurate digits of pi: 3.14. Around A.D. 150, Greek-Roman scientist Ptolemy used this method to calculate a value of 3.1416.\n4. Pi, as we all learned in school (and are reminded every March 14, on Pi Day), is defined as the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter. Denoted by the Greek letter \u03c0, this curious little number is approximately 3.14, although computers have calculated it out past 22 trillion digits and counting: 3.141592653589793238462643383279502\u2026, a sequence never repeating, never betraying any pattern, going on forever, infinity on a platter.\n5. In 1665, English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton used infinite series to compute pi to 15 digits using calculus he and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered. After that, the record kept being broken. It reached 71 digits in 1699, 100 digits in 1706, and 620 digits in 1956 \u2013 the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculator or computer.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

You should prioritize referencing articles from high-quality sources, but you should still refer to articles with poor source quality if they contain relevant information.\nPlease answer this Question:\nHow somebody came up with the number pi.\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nPi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, has been an important mathematical constant for thousands of years. It was first approximated by Archimedes, who used geometric approximations to calculate the value of pi to three accurate digits: 3.14. Later, Isaac Newton used infinite series to compute pi to 15 digits using calculus. Over time, mathematicians have used various methods to calculate pi's value, with the record reaching 620 digits in 1956 without the aid of a calculator or computer[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Well, hello there! I'd be happy to help answer your question about the origin of the number pi.\n\nAs I found in my research [1], the history of pi can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Greeks and Egyptians. The Greek mathematician Archimedes was one of the first to study pi, and he approximated its value using geometric methods [2]. He calculated the perimeters of polygons inscribed within and outside circles to obtain upper and lower bounds of the value of pi.\n\nLater, in the 17th century, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed calculus, which allowed for more precise calculations of pi [3]. Newton used infinite series to compute pi to 15 digits, and Leibniz developed the notation for pi that we use today [4].\n\nOver time, mathematicians continued to refine the value of pi, and by the 19th century, it had been calculated to over 100 digits [5]. Today, with the aid of computers, we know the value of pi to over 22 trillion digits [6].\n\nSo, to answer your question, the number pi was first studied by ancient civilizations, and its value was later refined by mathematicians using geometric methods and calculus.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. In the Palais de la D\u00e9couverte (a science museum in Paris) there is a circular room known as the pi room. On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of \u03c0. The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome-like ceiling. The digits were based on an 1873 calculation by English mathematician William Shanks, which included an error beginning at the 528th digit. The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949.\n2. In tandem with these calculations, mathematicians were researching other characteristics of pi. Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777) first proved that pi is an irrational number \u2013 it has an infinite number of digits that never enter a repeating pattern. In 1882, German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that pi cannot be expressed in a rational algebraic equation (such as pi\u00b2=10 or 9pi4 - 240pi2 + 1492 = 0).\n3. The first rigorous approach to finding the true value of pi was based on geometrical approximations. Around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes drew polygons both around the outside and within the interior of circles. Measuring the perimeters of those gave upper and lower bounds of the range containing pi. He started with hexagons; by using polygons with more and more sides, he ultimately calculated three accurate digits of pi: 3.14. Around A.D. 150, Greek-Roman scientist Ptolemy used this method to calculate a value of 3.1416.\n4. Pi, as we all learned in school (and are reminded every March 14, on Pi Day), is defined as the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter. Denoted by the Greek letter \u03c0, this curious little number is approximately 3.14, although computers have calculated it out past 22 trillion digits and counting: 3.141592653589793238462643383279502\u2026, a sequence never repeating, never betraying any pattern, going on forever, infinity on a platter.\n5. In 1665, English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton used infinite series to compute pi to 15 digits using calculus he and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered. After that, the record kept being broken. It reached 71 digits in 1699, 100 digits in 1706, and 620 digits in 1956 \u2013 the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculator or computer.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

I'd be happy to help answer your question about the origin of the number pi.\n\nAs I found in my research [1], the history of pi can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Greeks and Egyptians. The Greek mathematician Archimedes was one of the first to study pi, and he approximated its value using geometric methods [2]. He calculated the perimeters of polygons inscribed within and outside circles to obtain upper and lower bounds of the value of pi.\n\nLater, in the 17th century, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed calculus, which allowed for more precise calculations of pi [3]. Newton used infinite series to compute pi to 15 digits, and Leibniz developed the notation for pi that we use today [4].\n\nOver time, mathematicians continued to refine the value of pi, and by the 19th century, it had been calculated to over 100 digits [5]. Today, with the aid of computers, we know the value of pi to over 22 trillion digits [6].\n\nSo, to answer your question, the number pi was first studied by ancient civilizations, and its value was later refined by mathematicians using geometric methods and calculus. Over time, the value of pi has been calculated to increasing precision using a variety of methods.\n\nI hope that helps!

Often, the prosecution\u2019s case hinges on the child\u2019s credibility, and there is usually no physical evidence or eyewitnesses to the alleged crime[1]. Additionally, the result is a criminal justice system that shows an unexamined bias toward accused sexual predators, particularly those from the dominant race and class, by protecting them in advance from punishments that rarely materialize[1][3]. Furthermore, the testimony of one witness alone is sufficient to support a conviction for any offense, even in light of all of the defense testimony mentioned above[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, child rapists may receive lax punishment despite sufficient evidence to convict due to several factors. One reason is the criminal justice system's tendency to prioritize the credibility of the accused over that of the victim, particularly when there are no eyewitnesses or physical evidence [1]. Additionally, the lack of physical corroboration and the \"he said she said\" nature of many child molestation cases can lead to a bias toward the accused, as the prosecution's case often hinges on the child's credibility [2].\n\nMoreover, the criminal justice system often fails to consider the long-term effects of child sexual abuse on the victim, and the trauma and pain that can persist for years to come [3]. This can lead to a hypercorrection that favors the accused, rather than prioritizing the needs of the victim.\n\nFurthermore, the racial and socioeconomic biases within the criminal justice system can also play a role in the leniency of punishment for child rapists. Studies have shown that black and Latino individuals are more likely to be wrongfully accused of sexual assault, and that defendants of color are more likely to receive harsher punishment for the same crimes as their white counterparts [4].\n\nIn light of these factors, it is important to recognize that the criminal justice system is not always effective in holding child rapists accountable for their actions. Therefore, it is essential to consider alternative approaches to addressing child sexual abuse, such as restorative justice and victim-centered approaches, which prioritize the needs and well-being of the victim over the punishment of the perpetrator [5].\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n1.

This is due to the properties of airflow and fluid dynamics, which cause the fan to rotate very swiftly[3]. The dust is also collected by the fan because the air flow presses the strands of dust to the blade, creating friction and a stronger force than the centrifugal force which might pull them sideways[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, dust sticks to spinning fan blades due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the leading edge of the fan blades develops and maintains a charged edge, which attracts dust molecules [1]. Additionally, the inactive air above the fan blades allows dust particles to stick to the blades and remain there for an extended period of time [3].\n\nMoreover, the properties of airflow and fluid dynamics also play a significant role in the accumulation of dust on fan blades. The fan's rapid rotation creates a strong vortex of air that presses the dust particles onto the blades, causing them to adhere to the surface [3]. Furthermore, the friction between the dust particles and the blade surface, combined with the force of the air pressing the strands against the blade, keeps the dust in place [5].\n\nIn simple words, the spinning motion of the fan blades creates a strong airflow that presses the dust particles onto the blades, making it difficult for them to blow off. Therefore, even though the blades are moving rapidly, the dust particles still manage to stick to the surface.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n1.

Firstly, the leading edge of the fan blades develops and maintains a charged edge, which attracts dust molecules [1]. Additionally, the inactive air above the fan blades allows dust particles to stick to the blades and remain there for an extended period of time [3].\n\nMoreover, the properties of airflow and fluid dynamics also play a significant role in the accumulation of dust on fan blades. The fan's rapid rotation creates a strong vortex of air that presses the dust particles onto the blades, causing them to adhere to the surface [3]. Furthermore, the friction between the dust particles and the blade surface, combined with the force of the air pressing the strands against the blade, keeps the dust in place [5].\n\nIn simple words, the spinning motion of the fan blades creates a strong airflow that presses the dust particles onto the blades, making it difficult for them to blow off. Therefore, even though the blades are moving rapidly, the dust particles still manage to stick to the surface.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n1. How can I effectively clean my ceiling fan to remove dust and other particles?\n2. What are some tips for maintaining my ceiling fan to prevent dust accumulation?\n3. Can I use a fan with a different material for the blades to reduce dust accumulation?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nDust particles stick to spinning fan blades because of the inactive air above the blades, which allows the dust to stick and remain there for a long time. This is due to the properties of airflow and fluid dynamics, which cause the fan to rotate very swiftly[3]. The dust is also collected by the fan because the air flow presses the strands of dust to the blade, creating friction and a stronger force than the centrifugal force which might pull them sideways[5]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question. However, Assistant A's response was more comprehensive and detailed, explaining the process of dust accumulation on fan blades in a more understandable manner.

Furthermore, Assistant A suggested related questions that the user might find helpful, adding an extra layer of service to their response.

However, the city failed to fully approve the agreement, leading to the Justice Department suing Ferguson [2].\n\nLater, on APRIL 19, 2016, Ferguson and the Justice Department reached an agreement that ended the lawsuit and required sweeping reforms of the city's police and court systems [5].\n\nAs of now, the deal in Ferguson involves the implementation of these reforms, which include changes to the city's policing practices, training for officers, and the reform of the municipal court system [3]. The agreement also requires the city to take steps to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system [4].\n\nHowever, I couldn't find any information on the current status of the deal or any recent developments. If you have any follow-up questions, I would recommend checking recent news sources or official government websites for the most up-to-date information.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nFerguson, Missouri is currently involved in a lawsuit with the US Justice Department. The lawsuit was initiated after Ferguson failed to fully approve an agreement reached with the DOJ to reform the city\u2019s policing and municipal court systems[1]. The Justice Department responded to this by suing Ferguson[1][2][3]. However, Ferguson and the Justice Department eventually reached an agreement that ended the lawsuit and required sweeping reforms of the city\u2019s police and court systems[5]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more detailed and chronological explanation of the events that led to the current situation in Ferguson. It also acknowledges the lack of information about the current status of the deal and suggests checking recent news sources or official government websites for the most up-to-date information. On the other hand, Assistant B's response is more concise and less detailed. It does not provide any suggestions for further information or acknowledge the lack of current information. Therefore, Assistant A's response is more helpful and informative. So, my final verdict is [[A]].", "turn": 1, "tstamp": 1694278745.5320528}

The model also shows that high-latitude species, especially those with high oxygen demands, were nearly completely wiped out[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, marine life fare much worse than land life during the Permian extinction because of the severe warming of the oceans. Penn and co-authors (2023) found that rising ocean temperatures led to increased metabolism in marine animals, which in turn led to a greater need for oxygen. However, the warmer waters could not hold enough oxygen to meet these needs, resulting in a lack of oxygen and the subsequent extinction of many marine species (Penn et al., 2023).\n\nIn contrast, the land extinction, which occurred at a much slower pace, was likely influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in sea level, volcanic activity, and the evolution of new species (Payne, 2023). The study suggests that the Permian extinction was a complex event, with different factors affecting land and sea ecosystems in different ways.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the fate of marine and land life during the Permian extinction can be attributed to the unique physiological demands of marine organisms and the inability of the warmer oceans to provide sufficient oxygen to meet those demands.\n\nReferences:\n\nPenn, J., & Co-authors.

It\u2019s measured in foot-pounds or newton-meters.\n4. Before diagnosing your clutch problems, it\u2019s important to understand what a clutch is and how it works in regard to your vehicle\u2019s powertrain. A clutch is a mechanical component in a vehicle or other mechanical device that engages and disengages a powertrain or transmission between several rotating shafts.\n5. You need a clutch in your car because the engine spins all the time, but your car\u2019s wheels don\u2019t. To stop your car without stopping the engine, you need a way to disengage the wheels from the engine. Through the friction of the engine\u2019s flywheel and the clutch disc, you can engage your spinning engine to a sometimes-spinning transmission and visa-versa.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Not necessarily in a car.\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\n Hello! Based on the information I found, a clutch is a mechanical component that engages and disengages a powertrain or transmission between several rotating shafts [1]. It is used to transmit power and torque from one shaft to another, and it can be found in various machines and vehicles, not just cars [2].\n\nTo answer your question, a clutch can be used in a variety of applications beyond cars, such as in motorcycles, boats, and industrial machinery [3]. The purpose of a clutch in these applications is similar to that in a car, which is to transmit power and torque from one component to another while allowing for disengagement when needed [4].\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like to know more about clutches or their applications, I would be happy to help based on the information I found [5].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Wikipedia.

During the 1970s, marijuana was both vilified and idolized, with a person\u2019s stand representing more than an opinion of the plant itself. Cannabis was (and to some extent is) a cultural pivot point, used as both a symbol of authority and anti-authority, and counter-culture that evolved into its own culture. Between the dichotomy of these political and social issues, another group was ready to be heard.\n2. The story of 420 begins with five teens in San Rafael, California who often hung out by the wall outside their school, earning them the nickname \u2018The Waldos.\u2019 In autumn 1971, the Waldos were given a treasure map that was purported to reveal the location of a patch of orphaned cannabis plants. The owner was a Coast Guard member who could no longer tend his hidden crop, and it\u2019s rumored that he himself provided the group the treasure map.\n3. Many people are falling in love with it, and celebrities are no exception. The world-famous rapper Snoop Dogg, who for years has been an avid supporter of marijuana use, advertising his innate passion for the good weed without making a secret of it, has chosen to be an integral part of the industry, launching his own cannabis brand, 'Leafs of Snoop'.\n4. In the 1920s, recreational cannabis was growing as a fine companion in the underground party scene becoming just as popular in the speakeasy as whisky in a teacup. In fact, The Volstead Act of 1920 raised the price of alcohol in the U.S., making marijuana an even more attractive alternative. \u201cIn some respects, the [widespread] use of marijuana may have been an ironic and unintentional outcome of Prohibition.\u201d - Barney Warf, Professor at University of Kansas. Recreational marijuana use soon spread from the speakeasies to the jazz clubs, and was particularly popular among the black jazz community and \u2018hepsters.\u2019  Famous jazz singer Cab Calloway even wrote a hit tune about a comical conversation with someone high, Reefer Man. Famous singer Louis Armstrong was another lifelong fan of the herb, which he called \u201cgage.\u201d\n5. The Beatles' Revolver is undoubtedly one of the most famous (and most discussed) songs about marijuana: contrary to popular belief, it is not a celebration of love for a woman, but rather for the renowned plant material, which Paul McCartney himself appreciated. Black Sabbath's Sweet Leaf is unambiguous, just like the characteristic coughing fit that follows an exaggeratedly deep hit, which anticipates a riff that's anything but \"nebulous\".\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

During the 1970s, marijuana was both vilified and idolized, with a person\u2019s stand representing more than an opinion of the plant itself. Cannabis was (and to some extent is) a cultural pivot point, used as both a symbol of authority and anti-authority, and counter-culture that evolved into its own culture. Between the dichotomy of these political and social issues, another group was ready to be heard.\n2. The story of 420 begins with five teens in San Rafael, California who often hung out by the wall outside their school, earning them the nickname \u2018The Waldos.\u2019 In autumn 1971, the Waldos were given a treasure map that was purported to reveal the location of a patch of orphaned cannabis plants. The owner was a Coast Guard member who could no longer tend his hidden crop, and it\u2019s rumored that he himself provided the group the treasure map.\n3. Many people are falling in love with it, and celebrities are no exception. The world-famous rapper Snoop Dogg, who for years has been an avid supporter of marijuana use, advertising his innate passion for the good weed without making a secret of it, has chosen to be an integral part of the industry, launching his own cannabis brand, 'Leafs of Snoop'.\n4. In the 1920s, recreational cannabis was growing as a fine companion in the underground party scene becoming just as popular in the speakeasy as whisky in a teacup. In fact, The Volstead Act of 1920 raised the price of alcohol in the U.S., making marijuana an even more attractive alternative. \u201cIn some respects, the [widespread] use of marijuana may have been an ironic and unintentional outcome of Prohibition.\u201d - Barney Warf, Professor at University of Kansas. Recreational marijuana use soon spread from the speakeasies to the jazz clubs, and was particularly popular among the black jazz community and \u2018hepsters.\u2019  Famous jazz singer Cab Calloway even wrote a hit tune about a comical conversation with someone high, Reefer Man. Famous singer Louis Armstrong was another lifelong fan of the herb, which he called \u201cgage.\u201d\n5. The Beatles' Revolver is undoubtedly one of the most famous (and most discussed) songs about marijuana: contrary to popular belief, it is not a celebration of love for a woman, but rather for the renowned plant material, which Paul McCartney himself appreciated. Black Sabbath's Sweet Leaf is unambiguous, just like the characteristic coughing fit that follows an exaggeratedly deep hit, which anticipates a riff that's anything but \"nebulous\".\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

In short, the transmission of data wirelessly is made possible by the manipulation of radio waves. These waves are generated naturally by generating pulses of electricity. These radio waves can then be modified by their amplitude or frequency in order to transmit sound or data. This process can also be improved in order to increase the amount of data transmitted as well as the speed by which the data can be transmitted. As is illustrated by this blog post, the fundamentals of this process are relatively simple but can quickly become complex as the process is explored in greater detail.\n2. At the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna. This voltage is applied to the radio receiver, which extracts the information signal. The receiver first uses a bandpass filter to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then amplifies the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a demodulator.

These include:\n\n1. Kjeldahl method for protein measurement [1]: This method involves breaking down the food sample into its component parts, including protein, and then measuring the amount of protein present using a specialized machine.\n2. Solvent extraction for fat measurement [2]: This method involves using a solvent to extract the fats from the food sample, which are then measured using a device called a centrifuge.\n3. Indirect measurement of carbohydrates [3]: Carbohydrates are not directly measured in food, but instead are calculated by subtracting the amount of protein, fat, and water from the total weight of the food. This is done by measuring the amount of these components individually and then subtracting them from the total weight.\n4. Analytical values for calories, vitamins, and minerals [4]: These values are determined using specialized equipment and techniques, such as spectroscopy and chromatography, which can measure the presence and amount of these nutrients in the food sample.\n\nIt is important to note that these methods may vary depending on the specific food being tested and the laboratory or facility performing the tests. Additionally, it is important to consult reputable sources when looking for information on nutritional values, as some sources may be more accurate or up-to-date than others.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

Kjeldahl method for protein measurement [1]: This method involves breaking down the food sample into its component parts, including protein, and then measuring the amount of protein present using a specialized machine.\n2. Solvent extraction for fat measurement [2]: This method involves using a solvent to extract the fats from the food sample, which are then measured using a device called a centrifuge.\n3. Indirect measurement of carbohydrates [3]: Carbohydrates are not directly measured in food, but instead are calculated by subtracting the amount of protein, fat, and water from the total weight of the food. This is done by measuring the amount of these components individually and then subtracting them from the total weight.\n4. Analytical values for calories, vitamins, and minerals [4]: These values are determined using specialized equipment and techniques, such as spectroscopy and chromatography, which can measure the presence and amount of these nutrients in the food sample.\n\nIt is important to note that these methods may vary depending on the specific food being tested and the laboratory or facility performing the tests. Additionally, it is important to consult reputable sources when looking for information on nutritional values, as some sources may be more accurate or up-to-date than others.\n\nI hope this information is helpful! If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Kjeldahl, J. (1883). \"On the determination of nitrogen in organic substances\".

Determining the nutritional value starts by determining how much of each of the components your food contains[1]. Carbohydrates aren't specifically measured in food, but are calculated by measuring the amount of protein, fat, and water in food, and then subtracting the sum from the total weight of the food[3]. Proteins are measured using the Kjeldahl method and fats are measured by solvent extraction, while carbohydrates and Calories are measured by their analytical values[5]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more detailed and comprehensive response to the user's question.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Another study examining centipedes showed that the points at which the legs contact the ground and sensations from surrounding legs impact their overall leg movements (Yasui et al. 2017). Centipedes can navigate different terrain with ease by coordinating their leg movements, likely through a decentralized method of sensory inputs. Scientists think this decentralization may be a way that moving robots can \u201cthink\u201d in the future.\n2. Here are the 6 reasons why you have centipedes, and why they will stick around long after you squish or flush a few.\n3. With the exception of the slow-moving soil centipedes, which are built to burrow, Chilopods can run fast. A centipede's body is suspended in a cradle of long legs. When those legs start moving, this gives the centipede more maneuverability over and around obstacles as it flees predators or chases prey. The tergites\u2014the dorsal surface of the body segments\u2014may also be modified to keep the body from swaying while in motion. This all results in the centipede being lighting-quick.\n4. Having so many legs can be advantageous because of the ability to prevent falling, as well as having other legs take over when some legs may malfunction. In order to study locomotion and maneuverability by using multiple legs simultaneously, scientists created a centipede-like robot (with 12 legs) (Aoi et al. 2016). The same study reported the important relationship between stability and maneuverability, especially during the turning experiments carried out by their robot.\n5. Should a centipede find itself in the grip of a bird or other predator, it can often escape by sacrificing a few legs. The bird is left with a beak full of legs, and the clever centipede makes a fast escape on those that remain. Since centipedes continue to molt as adults, they can usually repair the damage by simply regenerating legs. If you find a centipede with a few legs that are shorter than the others, it is likely in the process of recovering from a predator attack.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This system is likely the same for the centipede-like robot created by scientists, which shows the importance of this decentralization in the future of moving robots[1].

According to Yasui et al. (2017), the points at which the legs contact the ground and sensations from surrounding legs impact the overall leg movements, allowing the centipede to navigate different terrain with ease. This suggests that the legs may continue to move even after the central nervous system has been damaged or removed, as the decentralized system allows for coordinated movements without central control. Additionally, the fact that centipedes can regenerate legs and continue to molt as adults (Aoi et al., 2016) may also contribute to the legs continuing to move after squishing.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Another study examining centipedes showed that the points at which the legs contact the ground and sensations from surrounding legs impact their overall leg movements (Yasui et al. 2017). Centipedes can navigate different terrain with ease by coordinating their leg movements, likely through a decentralized method of sensory inputs. Scientists think this decentralization may be a way that moving robots can \u201cthink\u201d in the future.\n2. Here are the 6 reasons why you have centipedes, and why they will stick around long after you squish or flush a few.\n3. With the exception of the slow-moving soil centipedes, which are built to burrow, Chilopods can run fast. A centipede's body is suspended in a cradle of long legs. When those legs start moving, this gives the centipede more maneuverability over and around obstacles as it flees predators or chases prey. The tergites\u2014the dorsal surface of the body segments\u2014may also be modified to keep the body from swaying while in motion. This all results in the centipede being lighting-quick.\n4. Having so many legs can be advantageous because of the ability to prevent falling, as well as having other legs take over when some legs may malfunction. In order to study locomotion and maneuverability by using multiple legs simultaneously, scientists created a centipede-like robot (with 12 legs) (Aoi et al. 2016). The same study reported the important relationship between stability and maneuverability, especially during the turning experiments carried out by their robot.\n5. Should a centipede find itself in the grip of a bird or other predator, it can often escape by sacrificing a few legs. The bird is left with a beak full of legs, and the clever centipede makes a fast escape on those that remain. Since centipedes continue to molt as adults, they can usually repair the damage by simply regenerating legs. If you find a centipede with a few legs that are shorter than the others, it is likely in the process of recovering from a predator attack.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The high-end restaurants have also developed a way of influencing the customer\u2019s mindset by making sure they assign the delicacy status to every dish or creating a cognitive dissonance which our minds dislike[3]. This creates a perception of the portion sizes being in proportion to the price and image of the restaurant[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, high-end and expensive restaurants often serve tiny food portions due to a psychological phenomenon known as the \"delicacy effect\" [1]. This phenomenon suggests that when consumers perceive a product as expensive, they tend to assign higher quality and value to it, regardless of the actual quantity. As a result, high-end restaurants may intentionally serve smaller portions to create the illusion of exclusivity and luxury.\n\nAdditionally, the use of small portions in high-end restaurants may also be influenced by the concept of \"cognitive dissonance\" [3], where consumers experience discomfort when they encounter conflicting ideas or values. In this case, the gap between the high price and small portion size can create a sense of dissonance, leading consumers to either assign delicacy status to every dish or rationalize the portion size as a sign of exclusivity.\n\nIt's worth noting that this phenomenon is not unique to high-end restaurants, as it has been observed in other industries such as fashion and luxury goods [2]. However, the phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the culinary world, where the presentation and exclusivity of a dish can greatly impact the consumer's perception of its quality.\n\nIn summary, the tiny portions in high-end restaurants are not simply a result of being stingy with food, but rather a deliberate choice driven by psychological factors and the desire to create an exclusive experience for the consumer.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n1. How do high-end restaurants balance the desire for exclusivity with the need to provide a satisfying dining experience?\n2.

That is only a power-on button. It is very important that you shut down your system properly. Simply turning the power off with the power switch can cause serious file system damage. While the system is on, files are in use even if you are not doing anything. Remember that there are many processes running in the background all the time, and using the power switch does not allow the graceful shutdown of your computer.\n2. If you were taught to never turn your PC off by pressing the power button, that\u2019s because older computers couldn\u2019t handle the sudden shutdown. Hitting the button would shut off all the power flowing to the computer\u2019s hardware.

That is only a power-on button. It is very important that you shut down your system properly. Simply turning the power off with the power switch can cause serious file system damage. While the system is on, files are in use even if you are not doing anything. Remember that there are many processes running in the background all the time, and using the power switch does not allow the graceful shutdown of your computer.\n2. If you were taught to never turn your PC off by pressing the power button, that\u2019s because older computers couldn\u2019t handle the sudden shutdown. Hitting the button would shut off all the power flowing to the computer\u2019s hardware. In other words, older computers couldn\u2019t shut down properly, which meant you would have to deal with corrupted files or lost work.\n3. Many computer users were trained never to turn their PCs off by pressing the power button on their desktop PC\u2019s case. This used to cause problems in the previous millennium, but it\u2019s now perfectly safe to shut down with the power button.\n4. It might sound mind-boggling to hear you can press the power button for a stress-free shutdown. But if you have a computer made in the past 10 years, it\u2019s perfectly fine to turn your PC off this way. It doesn\u2019t cause any issues; it simply shuts down your computer.\n5. When you press the physical power button, you probably expect it to shut down. But you can change the button\u2019s purpose, so it sleeps, hibernates or even shuts off the display.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Additionally, Marvel has been able to use its trademark law protections to further secure revenue from character merchandizing [3].\n\nIn terms of how Marvel's character licensing works, the process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Marvel identifies a potential licensee, such as a manufacturer or studio, and negotiates a licensing agreement with them.\n2. The licensing agreement outlines the terms and conditions of the license, including the specific characters that may be used, the geographic regions where the products may be sold, and the duration of the license.\n3. The licensee produces products in the likeness of the designated characters, and Marvel receives a percentage of the revenue generated by these sales.\n\nOverall, Marvel's character licensing strategy has been highly successful, enabling the company to leverage the commercial value of its IP assets and generate significant revenue from a wide range of merchandising activities.\n\nTL;DR: Marvel's character licensing strategy involves negotiating licensing agreements with manufacturers and studios to produce products in the likeness of its comic book characters, while protecting its IP assets and ensuring that its characters are used in a way that aligns with its brand and values.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nMarvel's character licensing works by leveraging the commercial value of its superheroes through a series of profitable licensing agreements. These agreements define and structure the business relationship between the licensee and the licensor, outlining the terms and conditions by which a manufacturer may produce, for example, a toy in the likeness of a given character. Marvel's robust IP assets have enabled it to reap enormous benefits from its licensing activities, such as low-risk movie-licensing strategy that means that film studios carry all the financial risk in developing the film, while creating multiple marketing opportunities for Marvel. Marvel has also struck licensing deals across multiple media platforms and has been able to bring film-licensed characters back home through specific contracts. Moreover, Marvel Studios' creation in 1996 was an important step in achieving its goal of acquiring full control over its creative assets and a greater stake in the box office returns generated by these movies[1]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the user's question about how Marvel's character licensing works.

Since the beginning of heavy music, whether that be Sabbath and Zeppelin or even their classical forefathers, there\u2019s been a concern that such dark, aggressive sounding music must be something truly evil.

For this part of the inquiry, I will also be using interviews with the band and reviews of their albums to support my analysis. The paper will end by taking stock of the discussed subjects and presenting some preliminary findings, followed by a conclusion in which an answer to the research question will be provided.\n3. Still, the association of metal with the devil is far from absolute. There are many metal bands that rarely refer to the satanic in their music like Deep Purple and the Scorpions, and even Black Sabbath has songs in their repertoire that do not mention the devil at all. The late hard rock and heavy metal musician Ronnie James Dio was an interesting figure in this regard, because he rose to prominence as the vocalist of Rainbow singing about epic fantasy, then joined Black Sabbath to replace Ozzy Osbourne after the original singer had left, and eventually started his own band named Dio to make music that included references to the satanic. Finally, there are also examples of metal inspired by war and chaos in more secular historical terms and seemingly separated from biblical eschatology, such as in the music of the power metal band Sabaton and the 1982 song \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d by Iron Maiden.\n4. Metal is an easy target for such claims. Satanic imagery and even traditional Christian imagery has always been associated with metal. According to the Bible and traditional lore, nothing is scarier than the devil, no place has the power to instill horror like Hell, and no being is more powerful than a vengeful god who will rain down fire and brimstone, smiting an entire land. So clearly, a lot of seminal bands have co-opted religious iconography or language to invoke these powerful themes.

The answer is actually very short, simple, and straightforward: in fact there isn't all that much Satanist stuff in heavy metal, although it may seem so to the casual observer.

While outright \u201cSatanist stuff\u201d is not exactly prominent in Heavy Metal overall, there is no denying that Heavy Metal is deeply infused with references to Satan, demons, and occult lore of all sorts.

The use of dark, aggressive sounding music, combined with lyrics referencing the devil, has led to a belief that metal music is inherently satanic. However, there are many metal bands that rarely refer to the satanic in their music, such as Deep Purple and the Scorpions. There is also a distinction between overtly satanic or occult bands and anti-Satanic or anti-occult Christian metal bands, with most instances falling somewhere in the middle[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, the connection between Satanism and metal music is a complex and multifaceted one. While some metal bands have indeed embraced Satanic and occult themes in their music, it is not accurate to say that all metal music is Satanic or that there is a direct and consistent connection between the two.\n\nOne reason for the association between metal and Satanism is the use of certain imagery and symbolism in the music and aesthetics of some metal bands. For example, some bands have incorporated Satanic and occult symbols into their album artwork, lyrics, and stage shows. However, as noted by [1], these symbols are often used in a symbolic or metaphorical sense, rather than as a literal expression of Satanic beliefs.\n\nAnother reason for the association is the perceived connection between metal music and the counterculture and rebelliousness of the 1960s and 1970s. As [2] explains, the origins of metal can be traced back to the blues and psychedelic rock of the 1960s, which were themselves associated with countercultural and rebellious themes. This connection to the counterculture has led some to view metal as a form of \"anti-establishment\" music, which has been further reinforced by the association with Satanism and occultism.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all metal bands have embraced Satanic or occult themes in their music. As [3] observes, there are many metal bands that have little or no connection to Satanism or occultism, and who instead focus on more traditional themes such as love, heartbreak, and personal struggle.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is a connection between Satanism and some forms of metal music, it is not accurate to say that all metal music is Satanic or that there is a direct and consistent connection between the two. The association between metal and Satanism is complex and multifaceted, and is influenced by a variety of factors, including the use of certain imagery and symbolism, the perceived connection to the counterculture, and the diverse range of themes and styles within the metal genre.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] D.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. While a wet nose is a healthy sign in your dog, a dry nose isn\u2019t necessarily cause for worry. Young dogs that love to lick are going to have wet noses, but as dogs age, their noses typically become a bit dryer. The dryness could also be a sign that your canine is dehydrated, Dr. Lands says, so be sure your dog gets plenty of water.\n2. So although a wet nose is an indicator of good health, while a dry nose can mean the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s not always this clear. A healthy dog can have a dry or moist nose, but if they get ill can become too dry or too wet. Be on the lookout for changes like this as they can be great early warning signs your dog isn\u2019t quite tip-top. But just be sure to spot other changes too, as a dry or wet nose on its own doesn\u2019t indicate health on its own.\n3. A very, very wet nose can also be a sign that your dog is sick. Dogs are like humans in that \u201cif we start to get some sort of infection in our nose or upper respiratory infection, our noses can become more moist and we can start getting some mucus buildup in our nose or coming out of our nostrils,\u201d Dr. Lands says.\n4. Most often, a wet dog nose means they are healthy. However, a dry nose doesn\u2019t always point to a problem. The level of moisture and temperature of your dog\u2019s nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions. Sometimes, it can even fluctuate during a single day! Your pup may get a dry nose after a nap, or after intense playtime that left them dehydrated. The same is true for the temperature of your puppy's nose. Don\u2019t fret if you notice their nose is a bit warmer than usually, chances are it\u2019s just due to the weather.\n5. The answer is: sometimes! A healthy dog\u2019s nose can be wet for various reasons that help with its functions.

A wet nose is a healthy sign for dogs because it helps them sense their environment through their special Jacobson\u2019s organ[5]. However, a very wet nose can also be a sign of illness, such as an upper respiratory infection[3]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, dogs have wet noses because their noses secrete mucus to trap anything that might damage their lungs. This mucus helps to keep their respiratory system clean and healthy. Additionally, dogs lick their noses regularly, which helps to keep their noses moist and aids in their ability to smell and taste. A wet nose is considered a sign of a healthy dog because it indicates that their respiratory system is functioning properly and they are able to trap and remove any harmful particles (such as allergens or bacteria) from the air they breathe. [1]\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a dry nose does not always indicate an unhealthy dog. The level of moisture and temperature of a dog's nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions, and some dogs may have a drier nose than others due to their breed or individual characteristics. [2]\n\nIf you're concerned about your dog's health, it's always a good idea to consult with a veterinarian. They can perform a thorough examination and provide personalized advice based on your dog's specific needs and circumstances.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are some common health issues that can cause a dry nose in dogs?\n* How can I keep my dog's nose moist and healthy?\n* Is it normal for my dog's nose to be a bit warm to the touch?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Assistant A and B both provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question. They both explained that a dog's nose is wet due to the secretion of mucus and regular licking, which aids in their sense of smell and taste. They also both noted that a wet nose is generally a sign of a healthy dog, but a very wet nose could indicate illness. \n\nHowever, Assistant B provided a more detailed response, explaining that a dry nose does not always indicate an unhealthy dog and that the level of moisture and temperature of a dog's nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions. Assistant B also recommended related questions for further exploration, which adds to the depth and helpfulness of the response. \n\nTherefore, based on the depth, detail, and helpfulness of the response, Assistant B provided a better answer to the user's question. \n\nFinal Verdict: [[B]]", "g2_user_prompt": "[User Question]\nToday is 09-08-2023\nYou are a smart AI assistant. Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. While a wet nose is a healthy sign in your dog, a dry nose isn\u2019t necessarily cause for worry. Young dogs that love to lick are going to have wet noses, but as dogs age, their noses typically become a bit dryer. The dryness could also be a sign that your canine is dehydrated, Dr. Lands says, so be sure your dog gets plenty of water.\n2. So although a wet nose is an indicator of good health, while a dry nose can mean the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s not always this clear. A healthy dog can have a dry or moist nose, but if they get ill can become too dry or too wet. Be on the lookout for changes like this as they can be great early warning signs your dog isn\u2019t quite tip-top. But just be sure to spot other changes too, as a dry or wet nose on its own doesn\u2019t indicate health on its own.\n3. A very, very wet nose can also be a sign that your dog is sick. Dogs are like humans in that \u201cif we start to get some sort of infection in our nose or upper respiratory infection, our noses can become more moist and we can start getting some mucus buildup in our nose or coming out of our nostrils,\u201d Dr. Lands says.\n4. Most often, a wet dog nose means they are healthy. However, a dry nose doesn\u2019t always point to a problem. The level of moisture and temperature of your dog\u2019s nose can fluctuate with the weather and environmental conditions. Sometimes, it can even fluctuate during a single day! Your pup may get a dry nose after a nap, or after intense playtime that left them dehydrated. The same is true for the temperature of your puppy's nose. Don\u2019t fret if you notice their nose is a bit warmer than usually, chances are it\u2019s just due to the weather.\n5. The answer is: sometimes! A healthy dog\u2019s nose can be wet for various reasons that help with its functions. All noses secrete some mucus to trap anything that might damage the lungs \u2013 if this drips down, the clear fluid can moisten their nose. Dogs also lick their noses regularly which makes them wet \u2013 by doing this they carry some scent particles into their mouths which can then be sensed through a special organ called the vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson\u2019s organ, in the roof of their mouth (this is one reason why smell and taste are so intricately linked).\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

The classified catalog, currently housed on the website of the State Archives, is hard to find, difficult to access, and almost impossible to search through or analyze.

The very existence of the 300,000 classified files\u2014their names, dates, and origin within the state bureaucracy\u2014had been kept a secret, until now. One-fifth of the files, deemed too sensitive still by the government, were excluded from the disclosure.\n3. Israel\u2019s State Archives unceremoniously published the contents of its catalog of classified archive documents this past summer, posting them online in 363 separate spreadsheets. Buried in the catalog of classified archives were more than 100 files dating back to the 1800s, and more than 2,000 files that predate the founding of the State of Israel but which the archive has yet to declassify.\n4. Israel recently published its catalogue of some 300,000 classified files, including thousands of documents from before the state was even founded.

I have a friend who has someone asking him to accept a personal check for mobile deposit but the check he is supposed to take the photo of, it isn\u2019t an actual photo but rather a scanned copy.

Whether you deposit a check into a bank account from an ATM, in-branch with a teller, or from a mobile deposit capture, the process for clearing and check acceptance is generally the same. Because paper checks have no actual monetary value themselves, banks have to verify whether the transaction can actually be completed or not. When the check is captured, financial institutions use a variety of data points to make a judgment about the validity of the check. The data they acquire needs to answer questions like, is the account of the check issuer in good standing? Are there enough funds in their account? Is the check a high dollar amount?\n3. - A new federal law known as the \"Check 21 Act\" makes it easier for banks to create and send electronic images of paper checks.

These data points include whether the account of the check issuer is in good standing, if there are enough funds in the account, and if the check is a high dollar amount.

These data points may include the account number, the check number, the check issuer's information, and the amount of the check.\n\nOne way banks verify the validity of a check is by confirming that the account of the check issuer is in good standing. They do this by checking if the account has sufficient funds to cover the amount of the check. Additionally, the bank may use a check verification system to verify the authenticity of the check. This system compares the check image to a database of known valid checks to ensure that the check is not fraudulent.\n\nIt's worth noting that even if the check is valid, the bank may still have certain requirements or restrictions for mobile deposit capture. For example, some banks may only accept checks up to a certain amount or from certain issuers. It's always a good idea to check with your bank to confirm their specific requirements and restrictions for mobile deposit capture.\n\nIn summary, when banks say that you can take a picture of a check and send it to them instead of going to the bank itself, they use a variety of data points to verify the validity of the check.

This amount can be in the thousands, if not the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and, well, NFL teams don\u2019t like parting with their money.\n2. The norm for NFL players are provisions that allow a team to cut a player at the beginning of the next year. So, the usual rule is that a player will always get paid for the current season, even if they do not play at all, but if they are unable to play due to an injury then the team can release them and terminate the contract the next year, as long as they decide to do so by a particular date, which is usually in March. Note that if a player cannot play due to injury, usually they get paid injury pay which is less than their full pay, but is still a substantial.\n3. Farmer: An injured player gets paid for as long as he\u2019s unable to play, no matter what his contract says. A team can\u2019t release an injured player until he\u2019s cleared. For most rookie contracts, players selected in the third round or later, there\u2019s something called an \u201cup-down,\u201d which is two minimum salaries negotiated in the collective bargaining agreement. The \u201cup\u201d is the minimum active salary, which this season is $420,000, and the \u201cdown\u201d ($303,000) is the minimum inactive salary. If a player is injured after eight games, he\u2019s paid eight weeks \u201cup\u201d and nine weeks \u201cdown\u201d (eight weeks, plus the bye).

There are also injury settlements, which must be agreed to within five days of a player being placed on injured reserve. Say a player suffers a sprained ankle in training camp and it\u2019s a three-week injury. The team can pay him for those three weeks, then release him. That player is eligible to return to that team after the number of weeks the settlement was for (in this case, three), plus another six weeks. So he would be eligible to return in any capacity by Week 10. That six-week \u201ctax\u201d is put in place so teams can\u2019t stash players by saying they\u2019re injured. If a player suffers an injury doing something unrelated to football, he\u2019s placed on the reserve/non-football injury list. It\u2019s at the discretion of the team whether the player is paid.\n5. If a player has an injury guarantee in his contract, that player will get paid his money. Let's say a player signs a five-year deal and has injury guarantees for the first three seasons.

[1] In Europe, the use of last names became more widespread after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The Normans introduced surnames to the English, and by the 1400s, most English families were using hereditary surnames. [2]\n\nThe choice of last names varied and was often influenced by social status, geography, and cultural traditions. In some cases, last names were based on a person's occupation, physical characteristics, or personal traits.

Lightning striking the ocean is quickly dissipated across the surface, but if you happen to be swimming about with a nice big steel conductor tied to your back like a scuba diver, you could well up your odds of being hit and in for a rough day. But still, it's way safer to be in the sea than playing a round of golf.\n2. On land, the impact of a lightning strike tends to be vertical, with each bolt striking its target and heading in a downwards direction. Water, however, acts as a strong conductor of electricity and behaves differently to solid materials. On hitting the water, lightning spreads horizontally: it\u2019s not just what\u2019s at the point of impact that\u2019s at risk but anything that finds itself in the surrounding areas too.

Apparently not, unlike air, the sea is a very good conductor as it contains salt. Rather than creating an direct narrow, path concentrating the \"punch\", the charge from the lightning strike spreads out sideways and downwards in an expanding half sphere from the surface. Any fish within a few meters of the strike area would probably be killed but beyond that they would probably just feel a tingle. Fish also tend to be a bit deeper in the water and not at the surface where the current is concentrated. So again, the odds are well stacked in favor of the fish.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Lowering public pensions' investment-return assumptions to more realistic levels and updating mortality will increase governments' pension debt. The next step in fixing public-pension funding is to determine how the debt will be paid down over time, or amortized. Most public pensions currently spread pension-debt payments over 30 years or more and backload those payments so that they get larger as payroll grows. The result is that government payments often do not reduce the initial pension debt much over the first 10 to 20 years of the payment schedule. And it is actually common for plans to build in periods of negative amortization, where the pension debt grows because expected payments are not large enough to cover the interest on the debt.\n2. The only way to ensure that pension costs and benefits are distributed equitably across generations of workers and taxpayers is to fully fund benefits as they are earned. And having a strong pension-funding policy is more important now than ever before because pensions are bigger and riskier now than ever before. As noted above, state and local public pensions are 47.5% funded at this point, but even that may be misleading. The last time pension funding was at roughly this level was 1983, when liabilities were approximately 18% of GDP. Today, liabilities are more than twice as large relative to GDP (42%). Because of pensions' increased scale, relatively small misses on the anticipated investment return or other assumptions (like mortality) would have outsized future budgetary implications. And because pension investment portfolios have gotten riskier, uncertainty about future returns has increased.\n3. Pension funds should be allowed to pursue their primary goal of ensuring retirement security for their beneficiaries. However, under certain circumstances\u2014such as a pandemic-induced crisis with rapidly escalating debt loads\u2014pension funds can play more of a command role as captive audiences. Yet this should only be done in exceptional circumstances and for a short period of time, preferably using public pension funds rather than individual pension accounts. If done in a targeted way, using pension funds for financial repression can result in citizens benefiting in economic growth and recovery over the long term in return for a short-term reduction in investment returns. At worst, this policy depletes pension savings without delivering welfare gains. We hope that our four core principles will help governments opting for this mechanism to have the best chance of positive results.\n4. Unfortunately, the majority of public pensions have been far too slow to adapt, and as a result have seen their funded ratios consistently deteriorate. Many governments face daunting amounts of pension debt that can make full funding appear out of reach. Fixing public-pension funding is not technically difficult, but in most jurisdictions, fully funding pensions at this point would require significantly higher contributions or reduced benefits (or both), making a solution politically challenging to achieve. However, failing to take meaningful action to close the funding gap will only make the problem more challenging and painful to fix in the future. No matter the scale of the problem, governments that work with their plans to craft workable solutions and begin down the path to full funding will be better positioned to weather the next downturn.\n5. The upshot of this history is that public pensions are bigger and riskier than ever. Pension liabilities and debt have never been so large relative to taxpayers' capacity to pay, and pension investments have never been so uncertain. Public pensions' finances have continued to deteriorate despite a decade-long bull market that has seen the S&P 500 index grow by more than 300% from its bottom in 2009. It's clear that pension plans are not simply going to grow their way back to fiscal health, and that more must be done to reverse the deleterious effects of rising pension debt.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This increases governments' pension debt, which is then spread over 30 years or more and backloaded, meaning that the payments often do not reduce the initial pension debt much over the first 10 to 20 years of the payment schedule[1]. This can also lead to periods of negative amortization, where the pension debt grows because expected payments are not large enough to cover the interest on the debt[1][2]. Additionally, as pensions are bigger and riskier now than ever before, relatively small misses on investment returns or other assumptions (like mortality) would have outsized future budgetary implications[2]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, pension funds can accumulate a deficit when the expected returns on investments are lower than the amounts promised to beneficiaries, resulting in a gap between the funds' assets and liabilities. This can happen when investments do not perform as well as anticipated, or when the pension fund's assumptions about investment returns and mortality do not materialize.\n\nAccording to [1], state and local public pensions are currently 47.5% funded, which means that they have a significant funding gap. This gap has been exacerbated by the recent pandemic-induced crisis, which has led to rapidly escalating debt loads and increased uncertainty about future returns.\n\nIt is allowed to happen because pension funds are not required to maintain a specific level of funding, and they can invest their assets in a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. However, if the investments do not perform well, or if the pension fund's assumptions are overly optimistic, the fund can become underfunded, leading to a deficit.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic-induced crisis, pension funds can play a more commanding role as captive audiences, as noted in [3]. This can involve using public pension funds to support economic growth and recovery, although this should only be done in a targeted way and for a short period of time.\n\nOverall, the accumulation of a deficit in a pension fund can be caused by a variety of factors, including investment performance, mortality assumptions, and contribution rates. It is important for governments to carefully manage their pension funds and address any funding gaps in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of retirement benefits for their citizens.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the current funding levels of state and local public pensions in the United States?\n* How have recent economic conditions, such as the pandemic, affected public pension funding?\n* What are some potential solutions for addressing pension funding gaps?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question.

The result is that government payments often do not reduce the initial pension debt much over the first 10 to 20 years of the payment schedule. And it is actually common for plans to build in periods of negative amortization, where the pension debt grows because expected payments are not large enough to cover the interest on the debt.\n2. The only way to ensure that pension costs and benefits are distributed equitably across generations of workers and taxpayers is to fully fund benefits as they are earned. And having a strong pension-funding policy is more important now than ever before because pensions are bigger and riskier now than ever before. As noted above, state and local public pensions are 47.5% funded at this point, but even that may be misleading. The last time pension funding was at roughly this level was 1983, when liabilities were approximately 18% of GDP. Today, liabilities are more than twice as large relative to GDP (42%). Because of pensions' increased scale, relatively small misses on the anticipated investment return or other assumptions (like mortality) would have outsized future budgetary implications. And because pension investment portfolios have gotten riskier, uncertainty about future returns has increased.\n3. Pension funds should be allowed to pursue their primary goal of ensuring retirement security for their beneficiaries. However, under certain circumstances\u2014such as a pandemic-induced crisis with rapidly escalating debt loads\u2014pension funds can play more of a command role as captive audiences. Yet this should only be done in exceptional circumstances and for a short period of time, preferably using public pension funds rather than individual pension accounts. If done in a targeted way, using pension funds for financial repression can result in citizens benefiting in economic growth and recovery over the long term in return for a short-term reduction in investment returns. At worst, this policy depletes pension savings without delivering welfare gains. We hope that our four core principles will help governments opting for this mechanism to have the best chance of positive results.\n4. Unfortunately, the majority of public pensions have been far too slow to adapt, and as a result have seen their funded ratios consistently deteriorate. Many governments face daunting amounts of pension debt that can make full funding appear out of reach. Fixing public-pension funding is not technically difficult, but in most jurisdictions, fully funding pensions at this point would require significantly higher contributions or reduced benefits (or both), making a solution politically challenging to achieve. However, failing to take meaningful action to close the funding gap will only make the problem more challenging and painful to fix in the future. No matter the scale of the problem, governments that work with their plans to craft workable solutions and begin down the path to full funding will be better positioned to weather the next downturn.\n5. The upshot of this history is that public pensions are bigger and riskier than ever. Pension liabilities and debt have never been so large relative to taxpayers' capacity to pay, and pension investments have never been so uncertain. Public pensions' finances have continued to deteriorate despite a decade-long bull market that has seen the S&P 500 index grow by more than 300% from its bottom in 2009. It's clear that pension plans are not simply going to grow their way back to fiscal health, and that more must be done to reverse the deleterious effects of rising pension debt.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This can happen when investments do not perform as well as anticipated, or when the pension fund's assumptions about investment returns and mortality do not materialize.\n\nAccording to [1], state and local public pensions are currently 47.5% funded, which means that they have a significant funding gap. This gap has been exacerbated by the recent pandemic-induced crisis, which has led to rapidly escalating debt loads and increased uncertainty about future returns.\n\nIt is allowed to happen because pension funds are not required to maintain a specific level of funding, and they can invest their assets in a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. However, if the investments do not perform well, or if the pension fund's assumptions are overly optimistic, the fund can become underfunded, leading to a deficit.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic-induced crisis, pension funds can play a more commanding role as captive audiences, as noted in [3]. This can involve using public pension funds to support economic growth and recovery, although this should only be done in a targeted way and for a short period of time.\n\nOverall, the accumulation of a deficit in a pension fund can be caused by a variety of factors, including investment performance, mortality assumptions, and contribution rates. It is important for governments to carefully manage their pension funds and address any funding gaps in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of retirement benefits for their citizens.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the current funding levels of state and local public pensions in the United States?\n* How have recent economic conditions, such as the pandemic, affected public pension funding?\n* What are some potential solutions for addressing pension funding gaps?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nPension funds get a deficit when their investment-return assumptions are lowered to more realistic levels and when mortality is updated[1][5]. This increases governments' pension debt, which is then spread over 30 years or more and backloaded, meaning that the payments often do not reduce the initial pension debt much over the first 10 to 20 years of the payment schedule[1]. This can also lead to periods of negative amortization, where the pension debt grows because expected payments are not large enough to cover the interest on the debt[1][2]. Additionally, as pensions are bigger and riskier now than ever before, relatively small misses on investment returns or other assumptions (like mortality) would have outsized future budgetary implications[2]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question.

On 15 October 1997, a team led by Richard Noble designed and built a vehicle, the ThrustSSC (\"Super Sonic Car\"), which allowed Royal Air Force pilot Andy Green to become the first person to break the sound barrier in a land vehicle in compliance with F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile rules(5). \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question about breaking the sound barrier.

Planes may also need to turn to reduce noise over urban areas or to get established on course as soon as possible[4]. Airplanes are designed with several components that allow for midair turning, such as using all three primary flight controls to move the airplane around its three axes[4][5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, planes need to turn for several reasons. Firstly, to change direction and maintain a desired course [1]. Airplanes are designed with several components that allow for midair turning, such as the rudder, elevator, and ailerons [3]. These components work together to roll, yaw, and pitch the airplane, enabling it to turn.\n\nAdditionally, planes may turn immediately after takeoff to reduce noise over urban areas, avoid high terrain and storm cells, and to get established on course as soon as possible [4]. Departure routes at busy airports also help with traffic flow [4].\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific reasons for turning can vary depending on the flight and the airport. For example, some flights may turn earlier or more frequently than others due to weather conditions, air traffic control instructions, or other factors [1].\n\nIf you have any related questions or would like more information on a specific aspect of plane turning, I'd be happy to help.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Federal Aviation Administration.

The IRS is not able to enforce taxes on the wealthy effectively because it is vastly outgunned in audits of and litigation against large corporations[4]. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides about $80 billion to the IRS for greater tax enforcement, expressly targeting the top \u201c1 percent\u201d of high-income, high-wealth individuals, which is expected to collect at least $400 billion of that over the course of the next ten years[3]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, it appears that wealthy individuals and corporations are able to evade millions in taxes through various means, such as using offshore accounts, exploiting loopholes in the tax code, and engaging in aggressive tax avoidance strategies. These tactics are often legal, but they can be highly sophisticated and difficult for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to detect and prevent.\n\nOne study found that the top 1% of wealthy Americans hold a disproportionate amount of wealth offshore, with an estimated $36 billion held in offshore accounts [1]. This can make it difficult for the IRS to track and tax this wealth, leading to significant tax losses.\n\nMoreover, large corporations have been known to shift profits offshore to avoid paying taxes in the United States. For instance, a study by the Government Accountability Office found that almost 100 large U.S. corporations had shifted over $200 billion in profits to offshore subsidiaries between 2010 and 2015 [2]. This can result in significant tax revenue losses for the U.S. government.\n\nIn addition, the IRS has limited resources and capacity to pursue tax evasion and avoidance cases, particularly against wealthy individuals and large corporations. According to a recent report by the Treasury Department, the IRS collects only about 80% of the taxes owed, which translates to tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue each year [3].\n\nIn contrast, individuals and small businesses may be subject to more scrutiny and audits from the IRS, which can lead to a more aggressive pursuit of taxes owed. This can create a situation where the wealthy and large corporations are able to take advantage of loopholes and exploit the tax system, while those who are less well-off are more likely to be subject to scrutiny and penalties.\n\nOverall, it appears that the tax system in the United States can be exploited by wealthy individuals and large corporations, leading to significant tax losses and a more progressive tax burden. To address this issue, it may be necessary to increase funding for the IRS to improve its enforcement capabilities and to close loopholes in the tax code that allow for aggressive tax avoidance strategies.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Natasha Sarin, \"The Tax Gap: Estimates of Tax Revenue Lost to Tax Evasion and Other Forms of Tax Noncompliance,\" Congressional Budget Office, March 2022.\n\n[2] Government Accountability Office, \"Offshore Profit Shifting and the U.S. Tax Code,\" Report to the Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, November 2017.\n\n[3] Treasury Department, \"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022: A Plan for a Fairer and More Progressive Tax System,\" April 2022.\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided detailed and accurate responses to the user's question.

If the company making the hostile takeover successfully acquires a majority of the shares, then it can gain control of the target company.

In some cases, the company making the hostile takeover may take steps to increase the value of the company, such as selling off non-core assets, cutting costs, or increasing investment in research and development.\n3. There are a few ways a company may pursue a hostile takeover. Sometimes a bidder may try to buy a significant percentage of shares of the target company on the open market, hoping to gain enough voting power to persuade the board of directors to accept a takeover offer. If that doesn\u2019t work, the bidder uses its voting power to change management.\n4. A company may resort to a hostile takeover if the target company\u2019s management isn\u2019t open to acquisition bids.

The key difference between unemployment and underemployment is that unemployment refers to the economic situation in which an individual who is actively searching for employment is unable to find work whereas underemployment is a situation where there is a mismatch between the employment opportunities and the skills and education level of the employees. Both unemployment and underemployment result in adverse economic conditions of a country and should be managed effectively in order to reduce and control its negative effects. Thus, the government has a major role to play in policy formation in order to retain skilled employees.\n2. The U.S. unemployment rate was 13.3% as of May 2020, but at the same time, the U.S. underemployment rate was 22.8%. The unemployment rate is defined by the BLS as including \"as a percentage of the labor force (the labor force is the sum of the employed and unemployed).\" A measure of underemployment is needed to express the opportunity cost of advanced skills not being used or being underutilized.\n3. The difference between unemployment and underemployment can be explained as the economic situation in which an individual who is actively searching for employment is unable to find work (unemployment) and a situation where individuals do not utilize their skills and education optimally in their jobs (underemployment). Employment opportunities are generally low in developing nations thus many individuals migrate to developed nations in search of favorable employment conditions. Government policies should be in place to ensure that the country\u2019s individuals are employed as well as they are employed in jobs that enable them to utilize their education, skills, and ability to work to produce economic output.\n4. Underemployment is an often misunderstood part of the economy. Unemployment is a term that refers to the number of people who want a job and do not have one. Underemployment represents people who are working but are not working in a job that matches their skills or abilities, often leading to earning less than what he or she should earn. When a person cannot find a job that matches their availability, skills, and experience, that is called underemployment. When considering who has a job and how many people are without one, it\u2019s critical to understand the full picture.\n5.

For example, how would someone figure out which chemicals, when mixed together, taste like a peach?\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nArtificial flavorings are made by combining chemical compounds, either in their natural state or after processing them to create new flavors. Chemists extract the juice of fruits, such as oranges and lemons, and remove the water to create concentrates. They can then add water to reconstitute the juice. As new aromatic chemicals are synthesized, they can be combined to create an expanding list of artificial fruit flavors[3]. To determine which chemicals, when mixed together, taste like a peach, chemists can use laboratory analysis of the natural product, or they can experiment with different combinations of chemical compounds until they find the one that produces the desired flavor[1]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, creating artificial flavorings involves combining various chemical compounds to mimic the taste of a particular fruit or flavor. The process of creating artificial flavorings is not always straightforward and can be a complex and time-consuming task.\n\nTo determine which chemicals, when mixed together, taste like a peach, researchers and flavorists use a combination of chemistry and sensory testing. They start by identifying the key flavor compounds present in peaches, such as limonene, beta-ionone, and beta-damascenone [1]. These compounds are then isolated and analyzed to determine their chemical structure and properties.\n\nNext, the flavorists use their knowledge of chemistry to synthesize or combine these compounds in different ways to create a peach-like flavor. They may also use sensory testing, such as taste panels, to evaluate the intensity and character of the flavor [2]. This process can involve trial and error, as the flavorists adjust the ratios of the compounds and test the resulting flavors until they achieve the desired taste.\n\nIn some cases, the flavorists may also use natural extracts or essences as a starting point and then modify them through chemical synthesis or blending to create the desired flavor [3]. The resulting artificial flavor can be used in a variety of products, such as foods, beverages, and personal care products.\n\nOverall, creating artificial flavorings is a complex process that requires a combination of scientific knowledge and sensory expertise. It involves identifying and isolating the key flavor compounds present in a particular fruit or flavor, and then using chemistry and sensory testing to create a synthetic version of that flavor.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] E.

Chemists extract the juice of fruits, such as oranges and lemons, and remove the water to create concentrates. They can then add water to reconstitute the juice. As new aromatic chemicals are synthesized, they can be combined to create an expanding list of artificial fruit flavors[3]. To determine which chemicals, when mixed together, taste like a peach, chemists can use laboratory analysis of the natural product, or they can experiment with different combinations of chemical compounds until they find the one that produces the desired flavor[1]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the user's question. It explains the process of creating artificial flavors, from identifying key flavor compounds in the fruit to synthesizing these compounds to create the desired flavor. It also mentions the use of sensory testing and natural extracts in the process. On the other hand, Assistant B's response is more concise and less detailed, and it doesn't mention the use of sensory testing or the trial-and-error process involved in creating artificial flavors. Therefore, Assistant A's response is more helpful and informative for the user. \n\nFinal Verdict: [[A]]", "turn": 1, "tstamp": 1694279728.2362754}

It is believed to involve dissociation, where the subject voluntarily divides their consciousness, with one part responding to the hypnotist and the other retaining awareness of reality[1]. Hypnosis is said to be caused by a combination of relaxation, concentration, and suggestibility[1]. It is derived from the ancient Greek word \"hypnos\", meaning sleep, and the suffix -osis or -\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2[4]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, hypnotism is a state of consciousness characterized by heightened suggestibility, deep relaxation, and a focused attention. This state can be induced by a trained hypnotist using various techniques, such as guided imagery, progressive relaxation, and direct suggestion.\n\nDuring hypnosis, the subject's conscious mind becomes less active, and the subconscious mind becomes more accessible. This allows the hypnotist to make suggestions that can help the subject change their behavior, thought patterns, or physical sensations.\n\nOne theory of hypnosis, developed by Ernest Hilgard, suggests that hypnosis causes the subject to divide their consciousness voluntarily. One part of the consciousness responds to the hypnotist, while the other part retains awareness of reality. This theory is supported by studies that have shown that even when subjects are in a state of hypnosis, they can still sense pain or other physical sensations, such as the temperature of ice water. [1]\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the exact mechanism of hypnosis is still not fully understood, and there are many different theories and interpretations of the phenomenon. Some researchers have suggested that hypnosis may be related to changes in brain activity, such as altered activity in regions of the brain involved in attention and self-regulation. [2]\n\nOverall, hypnotism has been used for a variety of applications, including managing pain, overcoming phobias, and improving sleep quality.

Running on the treadmill can feel progressively harder over time, even when sticking with the same pace. That could be because running at the exact same speed for however many minutes is more taxing on the body than the natural speeding up and slowing down we do on the roads based on hills and other variables.\n2. Philip Riches, a Scottish expert on biomechanics, conducted research and discovered that running on a treadmill with no incline causes the exerciser to run with their knees very straight, rather than naturally soft and slightly bent. This motion can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet. The knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight. He recommends using a treadmill with no motor for a more natural running experience.\n3. If you spend any time running on the treadmill, you should consider your perceived exertion and your breathing rate instead of focusing just on your minutes per mile.

One of the main reasons is that running on a treadmill with no incline can cause the exerciser to run with their knees very straight, rather than naturally soft and slightly bent[2]. This motion can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet, as the knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight[2]. Additionally, the monotonous atmosphere of a treadmill could cause the muscles to become fatigued more quickly than when running outdoors[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, there are a few possible reasons why you may be able to run for half an hour on a treadmill without feeling tired, but running on concrete for just a couple of minutes can leave you feeling exhausted and with sore legs.\n\nFirstly, as Philip Riches, a Scottish expert on biomechanics, discovered, running on a treadmill with no incline can cause the exerciser to run with their knees very straight, rather than naturally soft and slightly bent [1]. This can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet, as the knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight. This may explain why running on a treadmill can feel easier on your legs compared to running on concrete, as the treadmill provides a more natural running experience.\n\nSecondly, it's possible that you are overtraining when running on concrete. As Walker notes, running on a treadmill can help you build mental toughness by focusing just on the running and no other outside distractions [2]. However, if you find yourself with tired and heavy legs when running but you're not out of breath, or you feel that you could run further but your legs are aching too much, overtraining is a very common cause. This is due to the fact that your joints and bones strengthen at a slower rate than your cardio fitness improves.\n\nLastly, it's worth considering your perceived exertion and your breathing rate when running on a treadmill, rather than just focusing on your minutes per mile. This can help you gauge your effort level and avoid underperforming or overdoing it [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the reasons why you may be able to run for half an hour on a treadmill without feeling tired, but running on concrete for just a couple of minutes can leave you feeling exhausted and with sore legs, may be related to the treadmill's impact on your knees and feet, overtraining, and your perceived exertion.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What is the optimal incline for running on a treadmill to reduce the risk of knee pain and muscle strain?\n* How can I prevent overtraining when running on a treadmill and on concrete?\n* What are some tips for properly warming up and cooling down when running on a treadmill?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Assistant B provided a more comprehensive and detailed response to the user's question.

In particular, if you find yourself with tired and heavy legs when running but you\u2019re not out of breath, or you feel that you could run further but your legs are aching too much, overtraining is a very common cause. This is due to the fact that your joints and bones strengthen at a slower rate than your cardio fitness improves.\n5. But the boring atmosphere, could also be an opportunity to grow as a runner if you choose to lean into the monotony.

This can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet, as the knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight. This may explain why running on a treadmill can feel easier on your legs compared to running on concrete, as the treadmill provides a more natural running experience.\n\nSecondly, it's possible that you are overtraining when running on concrete. As Walker notes, running on a treadmill can help you build mental toughness by focusing just on the running and no other outside distractions [2]. However, if you find yourself with tired and heavy legs when running but you're not out of breath, or you feel that you could run further but your legs are aching too much, overtraining is a very common cause. This is due to the fact that your joints and bones strengthen at a slower rate than your cardio fitness improves.\n\nLastly, it's worth considering your perceived exertion and your breathing rate when running on a treadmill, rather than just focusing on your minutes per mile. This can help you gauge your effort level and avoid underperforming or overdoing it [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the reasons why you may be able to run for half an hour on a treadmill without feeling tired, but running on concrete for just a couple of minutes can leave you feeling exhausted and with sore legs, may be related to the treadmill's impact on your knees and feet, overtraining, and your perceived exertion.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What is the optimal incline for running on a treadmill to reduce the risk of knee pain and muscle strain?\n* How can I prevent overtraining when running on a treadmill and on concrete?\n* What are some tips for properly warming up and cooling down when running on a treadmill?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nThere are several factors that could be contributing to the difference in your running experience on a treadmill compared to running on concrete. One of the main reasons is that running on a treadmill with no incline can cause the exerciser to run with their knees very straight, rather than naturally soft and slightly bent[2]. This motion can cause pain and muscle strain in the knees and feet, as the knees cannot absorb shock properly when they are too straight[2]. Additionally, the monotonous atmosphere of a treadmill could cause the muscles to become fatigued more quickly than when running outdoors[5]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more comprehensive and detailed response to the user's question. It not only explains the reasons why running on a treadmill might feel easier than running on concrete, but also provides additional context and advice, such as considering perceived exertion and breathing rate, and the possibility of overtraining.

The referendum was held to change the country's constitution, but it was defeated with an \"extraordinary clear\" defeat[2]. This led to Renzi's resignation[2][4], plunging the country into political chaos[4]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, the Italian referendum that caused Renzi to resign had significant effects on Italy's political landscape and economy. [1] The referendum, which was held on December 4, 2016, aimed to reform the Italian constitution and was defeated by a wide margin, with 59% of voters rejecting the changes. This outcome was seen as a major blow to Renzi's government and his proposed reforms.\n\nAs a result of the referendum's defeat, Renzi announced his resignation as Prime Minister, which was officially confirmed on December 7, 2016. [2] His resignation marked the end of the democratic government that had been in power since 2013 and plunged Italy into a period of political uncertainty.\n\nThe aftermath of the referendum saw a surge in support for anti-establishment and right-wing parties, such as the Five Star Movement and the Northern League. [3] These parties capitalized on the public's dissatisfaction with the political establishment and gained significant ground in the political landscape.\n\nThe referendum's outcome also had significant economic implications, as it led to a decline in investor confidence and a weakening of the Italian economy. [4] The Italian stock market experienced a sharp decline, and the eurozone's third-largest economy was plunged into political chaos.\n\nIn conclusion, the Italian referendum that caused Renzi to resign had far-reaching effects on Italy's political landscape and economy. The outcome of the referendum marked a significant shift in the country's political dynamics and had a profound impact on the future of the eurozone.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n1.

The small intestine contains a trace amount of microorganisms due to the proximity and influence of the stomach. Gram-positive cocci and rod-shaped bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in the small intestine. However, in the distal portion of the small intestine alkaline conditions support gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial flora of the small intestine aid in a wide range of intestinal functions. The bacterial flora provide regulatory signals that enable the development and utility of the gut. Overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine can lead to intestinal failure. In addition the large intestine contains the largest bacterial ecosystem in the human body. About 99% of the large intestine and feces flora are made up of obligate anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Factors that disrupt the microorganism population of the large intestine include antibiotics, stress, and parasites.\n2. The microbial composition of the gut microbiota varies across the digestive tract. In the stomach and small intestine, relatively few species of bacteria are generally present. The colon, in contrast, contains the highest microbial density recorded in any habitat on Earth with up to 1012 cells per gram of intestinal content. These bacteria represent between 300 and 1000 different species. However, 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species. As a consequence of their abundance in the intestine, bacteria also make up to 60% of the dry mass of feces. Fungi, protists, archaea, and viruses are also present in the gut flora, but less is known about their activities.\n3. Five phyla dominate the intestinal microbiota: Bacteroidota, Bacillota (Firmicutes), Actinomycetota, Pseudomonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota\u2014with Bacteroidota and Bacillota constituting 90% of the composition.

Moisture levels also play a critical role in the blandness of microwaveable food. Since microwaves rely on water molecules to cook, they tend to dry out your meal over time, reducing flavor even more. That\u2019s why microwaving vegetables can result in soggy or mushy results.\n2. Do you hate vegetables? You\u2019re not alone. About 20% of the population are \u201csuper-tasters\u201d. Super-tasters have more taste buds than other people and are super sensitive to the bitter compounds found in some food and drinks, even at low concentrations. If you have inherited super-taster genes then cruciferous vegetables (flower vegetables in the cabbage family) like bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, radish, swede, turnip, and watercress will taste disgusting.\n3. According to a recent \u2018Ask Umbra\u2019 column on Grist, there are three factors affecting nutrient loss when you cook vegetables: temperature, time, and water. \u201cNutrients tend to be both heat-intolerant and water-soluble,\u201d the article says, which means that any method that requires a) cooking at a high temperature for a long time, and b) uses a lot of water will result in the greatest nutrient loss. (So by this measure, boiling vegetables is likely the worst offender.) It goes without saying then that cooking at a lower temperature for a shorter amount of time and with less water would result in the least amount of nutrients lost, and that\u2019s what the microwave accomplishes.\n4. Unfortunately, the reheated remnants don\u2019t always live up to your expectations, particularly when microwaved. And if you think the microwave only affects the texture of your food, you\u2019re wrong. Microwaves are notorious for making food taste like plastic or cardboard.\n5. However, you don\u2019t experience this using a microwave. Due to its rapid cooking method and high temperatures, the molecular structures of foods are easily ruptured. What happens next is that some of the food compounds, such as protein, break down, releasing iron which gives off bad smells.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Additionally, super-tasters are more sensitive to the bitter compounds found in some food and drinks, even at low concentrations[2], and boiling vegetables at high temperatures for a long time and with a lot of water can result in the greatest nutrient loss[3]. Furthermore, the rapid cooking method and high temperatures of microwaves can rupture molecular structures of foods, releasing iron which gives off bad smells[5]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, there are several reasons why microwaved vegetables may taste bad.\n\nFirstly, microwaves can cause the molecular structures of foods to break down, leading to a change in texture and taste [1]. This can result in vegetables becoming mushy or developing an unpleasant texture.\n\nSecondly, the high heat used in microwaving can cause the loss of nutrients in vegetables, particularly water-soluble vitamins and minerals [2]. This can result in a less flavorful and nutritious meal.\n\nThirdly, the rapid cooking method of microwaving can lead to the formation of harmful compounds in food, such as acrylamide, which can affect the taste and safety of the vegetables [3].\n\nFinally, some people may be more sensitive to the bitter compounds found in certain vegetables, such as cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, which can make them taste unpleasant [4].\n\nIn summary, the combination of high heat, rapid cooking, and nutrient loss can result in microwaved vegetables tasting bad. However, it's important to note that not all microwaved vegetables will taste bad, and the taste can vary depending on the specific vegetable and cooking method used.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are some tips for cooking vegetables in the microwave to retain their nutrients and flavor?\n* Can you recommend some microwave-friendly vegetables that still taste good?\n* How do the nutrient losses in microwaved vegetables compare to other cooking methods, such as steaming or boiling?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Moisture levels also play a critical role in the blandness of microwaveable food. Since microwaves rely on water molecules to cook, they tend to dry out your meal over time, reducing flavor even more. That\u2019s why microwaving vegetables can result in soggy or mushy results.\n2. Do you hate vegetables? You\u2019re not alone. About 20% of the population are \u201csuper-tasters\u201d. Super-tasters have more taste buds than other people and are super sensitive to the bitter compounds found in some food and drinks, even at low concentrations. If you have inherited super-taster genes then cruciferous vegetables (flower vegetables in the cabbage family) like bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, radish, swede, turnip, and watercress will taste disgusting.\n3. According to a recent \u2018Ask Umbra\u2019 column on Grist, there are three factors affecting nutrient loss when you cook vegetables: temperature, time, and water. \u201cNutrients tend to be both heat-intolerant and water-soluble,\u201d the article says, which means that any method that requires a) cooking at a high temperature for a long time, and b) uses a lot of water will result in the greatest nutrient loss. (So by this measure, boiling vegetables is likely the worst offender.) It goes without saying then that cooking at a lower temperature for a shorter amount of time and with less water would result in the least amount of nutrients lost, and that\u2019s what the microwave accomplishes.\n4. Unfortunately, the reheated remnants don\u2019t always live up to your expectations, particularly when microwaved. And if you think the microwave only affects the texture of your food, you\u2019re wrong. Microwaves are notorious for making food taste like plastic or cardboard.\n5. However, you don\u2019t experience this using a microwave. Due to its rapid cooking method and high temperatures, the molecular structures of foods are easily ruptured. What happens next is that some of the food compounds, such as protein, break down, releasing iron which gives off bad smells.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

It\u2019s that time of the year when it\u2019s dark in the morning when you get up and dark when you\u2019re done with the work day.

This lack of light affects sleep and can have a noticeable impact on your energy, motivation, appetite, and overall mental state. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is very real for those unfortunate enough to suffer from it and can lead to more prolonged periods of depression. One way to stay ahead of the winter blues is to get better sleep with a regular sleep schedule. The goal is to maintain a consistent sleep routine despite the shorter days. The desire to sleep your way through the day or nap through the late afternoon because of the darkness is considered poor sleep hygiene and could actually make you feel worse.\n3.

When it\u2019s dark, the body releases a hormone called melatonin from the brain\u2019s pineal gland, signaling that it\u2019s time to feel drowsy (for this reason, melatonin supplements are often sold as a sleep aid). Because light impedes the rate of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland, melatonin production increases at night.

If the machine is not returning the coins, you need to check if slots are empty or not, and if there is a jam in the machine[1][2]. If the machine is returning the coins but there are items in there, the problem could be due to dirty or worn-out parts, or outdated mechanisms[1]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, there could be several reasons why a coin won't work on a vending machine at first, but then works eventually after retrying it one or multiple times. Here are some possible explanations:\n\n1. Low change: If the vending machine doesn't have enough change to dispense the item you've selected, it may reject the coin. However, if you try again with a new coin, the machine may have enough change by then to dispense the item. [1]\n2. Dirty or worn-out parts: If the vending machine's mechanisms are dirty or worn out, it may not be able to properly accept coins. Try cleaning the machine or replacing worn-out parts to see if that solves the issue. [1]\n3. Outdated mechanisms: If the vending machine's mechanisms are outdated, it may not be able to properly accept coins. Consider updating the machine's mechanisms to see if that solves the issue. [1]\n4. Jammed or clogged: If the vending machine is jammed or clogged, it may not be able to properly accept coins. Try clearing the jam or clog to see if that solves the issue. [2]\n5. Loose dollar validators: If the dollar validators are loose, they may not be able to properly validate bills. Try tightening the validators to see if that solves the issue. [5]\n\nIt's worth noting that vending machines can be finicky, and sometimes it may take a few tries for a coin to be accepted. However, if you've tried multiple times and the coin still isn't being accepted, it may be due to one of the issues listed above.\n\nI hope this helps!

This is a condition that can cause you to feel unsteady or dizzy, as if you are moving, spinning, or floating, even when you are standing still or lying down. There are several possible causes of balance disorders, including inner ear problems, medication side effects, and certain health conditions.\n\nOne possible cause of this feeling could be vertigo, which is a type of dizziness that is associated with a problem in the inner ear. Another possible cause is atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that can cause dizziness and disorientation. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction disorder (TMJ) can also cause a feeling of floating or dizziness.\n\nIf you are experiencing this \"floating\" feeling, it is important to see a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can help determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find it helpful to practice exercises that improve your balance and stability, such as standing on one foot or walking heel-to-toe. You can also try to reduce the risk of falling by removing any hazards in your home, such as loose rugs or slippery surfaces, and by using handrails or grab bars when needed.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the symptoms of a balance disorder?\n* How can I improve my balance and stability?\n* What are the treatments for a balance disorder?\n\nSources:\n\n[1] Mayo Clinic.

This is a condition that can cause you to feel unsteady or dizzy, as if you are moving, spinning, or floating, even when you are standing still or lying down. There are several possible causes of balance disorders, including inner ear problems, medication side effects, and certain health conditions.\n\nOne possible cause of this feeling could be vertigo, which is a type of dizziness that is associated with a problem in the inner ear. Another possible cause is atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that can cause dizziness and disorientation. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction disorder (TMJ) can also cause a feeling of floating or dizziness.\n\nIf you are experiencing this \"floating\" feeling, it is important to see a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can help determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find it helpful to practice exercises that improve your balance and stability, such as standing on one foot or walking heel-to-toe. You can also try to reduce the risk of falling by removing any hazards in your home, such as loose rugs or slippery surfaces, and by using handrails or grab bars when needed.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the symptoms of a balance disorder?\n* How can I improve my balance and stability?\n* What are the treatments for a balance disorder?\n\nSources:\n\n[1] Mayo Clinic.

According to [2], the U.S. lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs in the 2000s, which is a rate of loss unprecedented in U.S. history. This is attributed to the fact that U.S. manufacturing has been losing ground to foreign competitors, particularly in China and India [1]. Additionally, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation report states that the drop in manufacturing employment between 2000 and 2010 was unprecedented, with nearly 6 million American factory workers losing their jobs [5]. While the sector has recovered slightly since then, America's manufacturing workforce is still more than 26% smaller than it was in 2000 [5].\n\nI cannot answer the question related to the reason for the decline in manufacturing output, as the information I found does not provide a clear answer. However, I suggest some related questions that may provide more insight:\n\n* What were the main factors contributing to the decline in U.S. manufacturing output?\n* How did the loss of manufacturing jobs affect the U.S. economy?\n* What efforts have been made to revitalize the U.S. manufacturing industry?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] <https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2017/01/19/why-america-lost-5-7-million-manufacturing-jobs-in-the-last-decade/?sh=4d4d5b5d7f6c>\n\n[2] <https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/02/american-manufacturing-decline-obama-era-economy/>\n\n[5] <https://itif.org/publications/2010/06/08/the-decades-long-decline-of-manufacturing-employment-in-america>\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nAmerica lost 5.7 million, or 33%, of its manufacturing jobs in the 2000s due to the decline in manufacturing output, which in turn was caused by U.S. manufacturing losing out in global competition[1][2][5]. This was a rate of loss unprecedented in U.S. history, worse than in the 1980s, when BusinessWeek warned of deindustrialization and worse than the rate of manufacturing job loss experienced during the Great Depression[3].

Transaction fees [1]: PayPal charges merchants and customers a fee for each transaction, typically ranging from 2.2% to 3.5% of the transaction value, depending on the payment method and the merchant's agreement.\n2. Subscriptions and services: PayPal offers premium features such as card readers, business loans, and referral fees on cashback rewards [2]. These services generate revenue for the company through subscription fees and interest on cash.\n3. Interchange fees: PayPal earns a fee for every transaction made using a credit or debit card, which is a percentage of the transaction value [1].\n4. Interest on cash: PayPal earns interest on the cash held in users' accounts [2].\n5. Shipment services: PayPal promotes shipment services and earns a commission for each transaction [1].\n\nOverall, PayPal's revenue model is designed to generate revenue through a variety of fees and services, allowing the company to adapt and remain competitive in the finance industry. However, I could not find information on the company's exact revenue figures or breakdown of revenue by product category.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the main products and services offered by PayPal?\n* How has PayPal's business model evolved over time?\n* What are the company's current challenges and opportunities in the finance industry?\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nPayPal makes money through a variety of sources.

When a bubble rapidly expands and then collapses, it can cause a shockwave that propagates through the surrounding fluid, creating a loud noise and potentially causing damage to the surrounding container or structure. This phenomenon is known as cavitation, and it can occur in a variety of fluids, including beer and water.\n\nAccording to [1], the rapid expansion and collapse of bubbles in beer can create a train of waves that can cause cavitation, leading to the formation of large bubbles that rapidly collapse. This collapse of \"mother\" bubbles can create multiple, smaller \"daughter\" bubbles, leading to a chain reaction of bubble formation and collapse that can create a loud noise.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of water, the rapid expansion and collapse of bubbles can also create a shockwave that propagates through the surrounding fluid, creating an \"explosion\" effect. This is described in [2], which states that the rapid release of energy during the explosion of microbubbles is due to the sudden pressure effect of heat on produced or adjacent gases.\n\nOverall, the rapid expansion and collapse of bubbles can create a powerful shockwave that can lead to an \"explosion\" effect, regardless of the fluid in which they are formed.\n\nI hope this helps answer your question!

However, it doesn\u2019t have any living cells and is unable to repair itself if it undergoes physical or chemical damage. This means that enamel erosion isn\u2019t reversible, and the enamel won\u2019t grow back.\n2. As incredible as it is, enamel is not a living tissue. At the time of this writing, it cannot be naturally regenerated outside of laboratory conditions. No toothpaste, mouthwash, gooey paste or vitamin supplement can cause worn enamel to strengthen itself.\n3. The human body\u2019s pretty amazing: Broken skin heals; cut nails and hair grow back again; fractured bones knit together. But as amazing as the body's ability to repair itself may be, it can\u2019t regrow tooth enamel. Ever.\n4. When a tooth suffers damage, it loses something called dentin\u2014the hard, bony tissue underneath the enamel that forms the bulk of the tooth. Each tooth\u2019s stem cells produce new dentin, in an attempt to repair the damage. However, this innate repair mechanism has its limits and can only manufacture small amounts of tissue while combating a cavity, injury, or infection. This is why, under normal circumstances, teeth cannot heal themselves.\n5. Time, wear, and decay bore holes through a tooth\u2019s outer layers, resulting in cavities and other dental issues. Unlike a broken bone, enamel\u2019s defensive lining doesn\u2019t repair itself, explains Janet Moradian-Oldak, a biochemist and professor in the School of Dentistry at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Unlike other parts of the body, such as skin and bones, enamel does not have living cells that can divide and replace damaged or worn-out cells [1]. Additionally, enamel is not capable of naturally regenerating outside of laboratory conditions, and no toothpaste, mouthwash, or vitamin supplement can cause worn enamel to strengthen itself [2].\n\nWhile the human body has the ability to repair and regenerate many of its parts, such as skin, bones, and nails, it cannot regrow tooth enamel [3].

This means that enamel erosion isn\u2019t reversible, and the enamel won\u2019t grow back.\n2. As incredible as it is, enamel is not a living tissue. At the time of this writing, it cannot be naturally regenerated outside of laboratory conditions. No toothpaste, mouthwash, gooey paste or vitamin supplement can cause worn enamel to strengthen itself.\n3. The human body\u2019s pretty amazing: Broken skin heals; cut nails and hair grow back again; fractured bones knit together. But as amazing as the body's ability to repair itself may be, it can\u2019t regrow tooth enamel. Ever.\n4. When a tooth suffers damage, it loses something called dentin\u2014the hard, bony tissue underneath the enamel that forms the bulk of the tooth. Each tooth\u2019s stem cells produce new dentin, in an attempt to repair the damage. However, this innate repair mechanism has its limits and can only manufacture small amounts of tissue while combating a cavity, injury, or infection. This is why, under normal circumstances, teeth cannot heal themselves.\n5. Time, wear, and decay bore holes through a tooth\u2019s outer layers, resulting in cavities and other dental issues.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Antivirus software protects your device from viruses that can destroy your data, slow down or crash your device, or allow spammers to send email through your account. Antivirus protection scans your files and your incoming email for viruses, and then deletes anything malicious. You must keep your antivirus software updated to cope with the latest \"bugs\" circulating the internet. Most antivirus software includes a feature to download updates automatically when you are online. In addition, make sure that the software is continually running and checking your system for viruses, especially if you are downloading files from the web or checking your email. Set your antivirus software to check for viruses every day. You should also give your system a thorough scan at least twice a month.\n2. Antivirus is necessary even if you\u2019re on a Mac or Windows device, which both come with some level of virus protection built in. For total protection with endpoint protection and response, and blocks against malware and potentially unwanted programs, it\u2019s best to install a third-party antivirus software. The one exception is for iOS devices like iPhones and iPads, which don\u2019t require antivirus software. However, for Macs, Windows and Androids, antivirus software is a necessity, as new viruses are created every day.\n3. It\u2019s worth noting that some cheap (and free) antiviruses don\u2019t offer a decent level of protection, so while you may be saving money, you could put your devices at risk. That\u2019s why you should only choose a trusted low-cost antivirus that offers excellent security protections.\n4. But ultimately, relying on any one app to protect your system, data, and privacy is a bad bet, especially when almost every antivirus app has proven vulnerable on occasion. No antivirus tool, paid or free, can catch every malicious bit of software that arrives on your computer. You also need secure passwords, two-factor logins, data encryption, systemwide backups, automatic software updates, and smart privacy tools added to your browser. You need to be mindful of what you download and to download software only from official sources, such as the Microsoft App Store and Apple Mac App Store, whenever possible. You should avoid downloading and opening email attachments unless you know what they are. For guidance, check out our full guide to setting up all these security layers.\n5. - Easy-to-use. Whether you\u2019re an amateur or an expert, you need virus protection for your computers, your phones, and your tablets. But if the software is so technical that you need to be an IT expert to stay protected, then most users will get too frustrated to even receive basic protection. I personally tested each antivirus software here to make sure that pretty much anyone will be able to set it up easily and use it properly.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

Phones, on the other hand, are usually less exposed to these risks, so they don't require the same level of protection.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Antivirus software protects your device from viruses that can destroy your data, slow down or crash your device, or allow spammers to send email through your account. Antivirus protection scans your files and your incoming email for viruses, and then deletes anything malicious. You must keep your antivirus software updated to cope with the latest \"bugs\" circulating the internet. Most antivirus software includes a feature to download updates automatically when you are online. In addition, make sure that the software is continually running and checking your system for viruses, especially if you are downloading files from the web or checking your email. Set your antivirus software to check for viruses every day. You should also give your system a thorough scan at least twice a month.\n2. Antivirus is necessary even if you\u2019re on a Mac or Windows device, which both come with some level of virus protection built in. For total protection with endpoint protection and response, and blocks against malware and potentially unwanted programs, it\u2019s best to install a third-party antivirus software. The one exception is for iOS devices like iPhones and iPads, which don\u2019t require antivirus software. However, for Macs, Windows and Androids, antivirus software is a necessity, as new viruses are created every day.\n3. It\u2019s worth noting that some cheap (and free) antiviruses don\u2019t offer a decent level of protection, so while you may be saving money, you could put your devices at risk. That\u2019s why you should only choose a trusted low-cost antivirus that offers excellent security protections.\n4. But ultimately, relying on any one app to protect your system, data, and privacy is a bad bet, especially when almost every antivirus app has proven vulnerable on occasion. No antivirus tool, paid or free, can catch every malicious bit of software that arrives on your computer. You also need secure passwords, two-factor logins, data encryption, systemwide backups, automatic software updates, and smart privacy tools added to your browser. You need to be mindful of what you download and to download software only from official sources, such as the Microsoft App Store and Apple Mac App Store, whenever possible. You should avoid downloading and opening email attachments unless you know what they are. For guidance, check out our full guide to setting up all these security layers.\n5. - Easy-to-use. Whether you\u2019re an amateur or an expert, you need virus protection for your computers, your phones, and your tablets. But if the software is so technical that you need to be an IT expert to stay protected, then most users will get too frustrated to even receive basic protection. I personally tested each antivirus software here to make sure that pretty much anyone will be able to set it up easily and use it properly.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

[1]\n\nWhen we look at a screen through a camera, we are seeing the image reflected off the screen through the camera's lens and viewfinder. This process involves multiple reflections and can create a grid-like effect, especially when the camera is set to display a grid view. [2]\n\nOn the other hand, when we look at a screen through normal eyes, we do not see a grid because our eyes do not refract light in the same way as a camera lens. Instead, we see the image directly on the screen without any reflections or distortions.

Without swinging their arms, people use seven percent more energy than when they walk with a natural swing[2].

Researchers have found that swinging one's arms in opposition to one's legs helps to twist the body in the direction of the movement, making it easier to walk straight (1). This is because when we walk, our body naturally twists back and forth, and swinging our arms opposite to our legs helps to counteract this twisting motion (5).\n\nIt is not unusual for people to swing their arms when they walk, as it is a common and natural movement.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. A hot object, like a campfire, will warm the surrounding air. As the air around an object warms, it rises and mixes with the cool air above it. Light traveling towards you over the hot object would pass from cool air, through the currents of rising warm air, and then back into cool air. At each boundary, the light will change its direction. The temperature difference is constantly changing and the boundaries between the warm and cold air are moving as the heat rises, so the light rays don\u2019t always bend the same amount or in the same place. The visual effect of this unpredictable bending looks like waves coming off of the hot object. This is the same reason that stars appear to twinkle as their light passes through the Earth\u2019s air to where you stand on the ground.\n2. The problem with wind is it doesn't tip the balance in your favour that much. It won't provide much benefit at all near the heat source (ground) anyway. You might gain the ability to shoot a few feet closer to the ground than you would have been able to if the wind wasn't there. So have less heat-haze effect after rotation or before landing, but it's really more theoretical than of practical use. You may notice it's benefits, but it will be more luck than anything.\n3. Intuitively you would expect that this temperature/density issue would be affected by wind, the effect being to churn up and mix the different air masses and so reduce their relative differences in temperature and density. But maybe, dependent on the topography of the area, the wind effect may be almost nullified at very low levels (due to friction effects), and so this refractive problem remains.\n4. The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises.\n5. Wind can help by rapidly mixing the different densities of air. The better the mixing, the more even the air and the less the light is distorted. It probably won't be enough of an effect to help much on a strong sunny day. It's benefit will be more notably though, if the sun pop's behind a cloud for a few minutes.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

This effect is caused by the difference in density and temperature between the hot air and the surrounding cooler air, which causes the light to bend and change direction.\n\nOn the other hand, wind does not tip the balance in your favor when it comes to view distortion. While wind can help mix the air and reduce the temperature difference between hot and cold air masses, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on view distortion [2]. In fact, the effect of wind on view distortion is more theoretical than practical [3].\n\nTherefore, when you are in a hot environment and experience view distortion, it is more likely due to the heat haze effect caused by the hot air, rather than the lack of wind.\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are some ways to mitigate heat haze in hot environments?\n* How does the angle of the sun affect the heat haze effect?\n* Can the heat haze effect be used to create artistic or creative effects in photography?\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g1_judgment": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question.

Trolls tend to be corrected by the community, but some users respond with sympathy or understanding, or apologies or joking. However, these responses are rarer[1]. Trolling behavior can be induced, and can carry over from previous discussions, which can lead to the community worsening over time[4].

Specifically, the initial posts in the NegContext condition were less likely to be upvoted, with only 36% being upvoted compared to 90% in the PosContext condition [1]. This suggests that the negative tone and trolling behavior in the Lars AMA may have discouraged users from participating or engaging in positive interactions.\n\nAdditionally, the proportion of flagged posts and the proportion of users with flagged posts have been increasing over time on CNN.com, suggesting that trolling behavior is becoming more common and persistent in the community [5].

The signs are also a reminder of the complex procedure that would be required to remove them from the airliners[3].

They are usually open in the evening and late into the night, providing a space for people to dance, socialize, and enjoy live music or DJs. However, some nightclubs may offer special events or activities during the day, such as daytime parties or live performances. It's best to check with the specific nightclub for their schedules and operations. [1]\n\nIf you're looking for information on what nightclubs do during the day, I couldn't find any relevant information in the provided text. However, you may want to consider asking a different question, such as \"What are some popular nightclubs in [city name]?\" or \"What are the busiest nights at nightclubs in [city name]?\" as these questions are more likely to have specific answers based on the provided information.\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nNightclubs typically close during the day and do not offer any services or activities.

The resolution is the same and it's the same number of pixels, just different colors, right?\nReply:\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nChanging an image's pixel dimensions affects not only its onscreen size but also its image quality and its printed characteristics[1][2]. When you edit a video to add color correction or other effects, you are essentially resizing the video to a larger size in order to maintain the same amount of image data. This is why the video is a larger size after editing. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, the video will be larger in size after editing to add color correction or other effects, but the resolution and number of pixels remain the same. This is because when you make color corrections or add effects, you are essentially changing the color values of each pixel, which increases the amount of data required to represent the image.\n\nAccording to [1], when you resample an image, the width and height change accordingly to maintain the same amount of image data.

Please answer a question from a user.\nBelow are information you find about the question(some of them may be irrelevant!):\n1. Verizon 4G LTE wireless broadband is 10 times faster than 3G \u2014 able to handle download speeds between 5 and 12 Mbps (Megabits per second) and upload speeds between 2 and 5 Mbps, with peak download speeds approaching 50 Mbps. Cable speeds vary, but 4 to 12 Mbps are common. Why are megabits per second important? The bit rate plays an important part in the quality of movies and videos. As download rates approach 5 Mbps, you will experience fewer pauses while your HD video streams. If you and your neighbors have cable, you\u2019re all sharing the same lines. During peak Internet times, your speeds may slow down. The same slowdown may occur when you upload (transfer) or download large files, stream music and more.\n2. - Follow the 20 Mbps rule \u2013 A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time. If you have four people using smartphones, one TV streaming Netflix and another online gaming, an internet connection of 100 Mbps should be fine. (Add about 5 Mbps for every 10 smart home devices.)\n3. Internet download speeds of 200 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload or higher are considered fast. With average speeds around 152/21 Mbps, the bar for fast internet is higher than ever. Anything over 200 Mbps will be able to handle multiple online activities for multiple users at once without interruption. If you need a little help determining the best internet speeds for your needs, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n4. Keep in mind many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance. Adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks such as streaming in 4K or downloading an HD movie can hinder performance and make even \u201cfast\u201d speeds seem slow.\n5.

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance, such as adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks[4]. Furthermore, it is recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule, which states that 20 Mbps should be dedicated to each device that will be using the internet at the same time[2]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, it's not possible for people to utilize the internet faster than 4Gb/s, as the fastest speed ever recorded on a fixed wireless access (FWA) environment is 2Gb/s, achieved by the UK's Three mobile network operator [1]. However, the typical user can expect speeds of around 80-100 Mb/s [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that actual internet speeds can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the number of devices connected to the network, the quality of the connection, and the type of activities being performed online [2]. To ensure the best possible internet experience, it's recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule and dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time [2].\n\nIf you are looking for ways to improve your internet speed, you may want to consider upgrading to a faster internet plan, optimizing your network settings, or using a wired connection instead of wireless [3]. Additionally, you can try reducing the number of devices connected to the network at the same time, especially if you are streaming or downloading large files [2].\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the best internet plans for my needs?\n* How can I optimize my network settings for better performance?\n* What are the differences between wired and wireless connections?\n\n[1] Three.

During peak Internet times, your speeds may slow down. The same slowdown may occur when you upload (transfer) or download large files, stream music and more.\n2. - Follow the 20 Mbps rule \u2013 A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time. If you have four people using smartphones, one TV streaming Netflix and another online gaming, an internet connection of 100 Mbps should be fine. (Add about 5 Mbps for every 10 smart home devices.)\n3. Internet download speeds of 200 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload or higher are considered fast. With average speeds around 152/21 Mbps, the bar for fast internet is higher than ever. Anything over 200 Mbps will be able to handle multiple online activities for multiple users at once without interruption. If you need a little help determining the best internet speeds for your needs, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n4. Keep in mind many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance. Adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks such as streaming in 4K or downloading an HD movie can hinder performance and make even \u201cfast\u201d speeds seem slow.\n5. For example, UK\u2019s Three mobile network operator achieved a whopping 2 Gb/s download speed on a fixed wireless access (FWA) environment, but Three expects the typical user to pull in just 80 to 100 Mb/s.\n\n--- information end ---\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n0.

However, the typical user can expect speeds of around 80-100 Mb/s [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that actual internet speeds can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the number of devices connected to the network, the quality of the connection, and the type of activities being performed online [2]. To ensure the best possible internet experience, it's recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule and dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time [2].\n\nIf you are looking for ways to improve your internet speed, you may want to consider upgrading to a faster internet plan, optimizing your network settings, or using a wired connection instead of wireless [3]. Additionally, you can try reducing the number of devices connected to the network at the same time, especially if you are streaming or downloading large files [2].\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the best internet plans for my needs?\n* How can I optimize my network settings for better performance?\n* What are the differences between wired and wireless connections?\n\n[1] Three.

Verizon 4G LTE wireless broadband is 10 times faster than 3G \u2014 able to handle download speeds between 5 and 12 Mbps (Megabits per second) and upload speeds between 2 and 5 Mbps, with peak download speeds approaching 50 Mbps. Cable speeds vary, but 4 to 12 Mbps are common. Why are megabits per second important? The bit rate plays an important part in the quality of movies and videos. As download rates approach 5 Mbps, you will experience fewer pauses while your HD video streams. If you and your neighbors have cable, you\u2019re all sharing the same lines. During peak Internet times, your speeds may slow down. The same slowdown may occur when you upload (transfer) or download large files, stream music and more.\n2. - Follow the 20 Mbps rule \u2013 A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time.

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance, such as adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks[4]. Furthermore, it is recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule, which states that 20 Mbps should be dedicated to each device that will be using the internet at the same time[2]. \n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n Based on the information I found, it's not possible for people to utilize the internet faster than 4Gb/s, as the fastest speed ever recorded on a fixed wireless access (FWA) environment is 2Gb/s, achieved by the UK's Three mobile network operator [1]. However, the typical user can expect speeds of around 80-100 Mb/s [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that actual internet speeds can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the number of devices connected to the network, the quality of the connection, and the type of activities being performed online [2]. To ensure the best possible internet experience, it's recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule and dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time [2].\n\nIf you are looking for ways to improve your internet speed, you may want to consider upgrading to a faster internet plan, optimizing your network settings, or using a wired connection instead of wireless [3].

However, the typical user can expect speeds of around 80-100 Mb/s [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that actual internet speeds can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the number of devices connected to the network, the quality of the connection, and the type of activities being performed online [2]. To ensure the best possible internet experience, it's recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule and dedicate 20 Mbps to each device that will be using the internet at the same time [2].\n\nIf you are looking for ways to improve your internet speed, you may want to consider upgrading to a faster internet plan, optimizing your network settings, or using a wired connection instead of wireless [3]. Additionally, you can try reducing the number of devices connected to the network at the same time, especially if you are streaming or downloading large files [2].\n\nRecommended related questions:\n\n* What are the best internet plans for my needs?\n* How can I optimize my network settings for better performance?\n* What are the differences between wired and wireless connections?\n\n[1] Three.

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that many things can affect actual internet speeds and performance, such as adding connected devices and using the internet for demanding tasks[4]. Furthermore, it is recommended to follow the 20 Mbps rule, which states that 20 Mbps should be dedicated to each device that will be using the internet at the same time[2]. \n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]", "g2_judgment": "Assistant A provides a more accurate and comprehensive response to the user's question. Assistant A correctly states that the fastest recorded internet speed is 2Gb/s, which is less than the 4Gb/s the user is asking about.

However, the city failed to fully approve the agreement, leading to the Justice Department suing Ferguson [2].\n\nLater, on APRIL 19, 2016, Ferguson and the Justice Department reached an agreement that ended the lawsuit and required sweeping reforms of the city's police and court systems [5].\n\nAs of now, the deal in Ferguson involves the implementation of these reforms, which include changes to the city's policing practices, training for officers, and the reform of the municipal court system [3]. The agreement also requires the city to take steps to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system [4].\n\nHowever, I couldn't find any information on the current status of the deal or any recent developments.
