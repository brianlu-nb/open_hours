Where are the bits? There's still good [comedy] shows, but movie comedy...it's hard. My theory: I think Marvel ruined it. I feel like superhero movies ruined comedies because you go to the theater and you expect to watch something that cost $200 million to make, and comedy movies aren't that. So you're like, 'Why would I spend the same amount of money to go watch a little comedy in the theater if I can spend that and watch something that is worth $200 million?' And they still make those movies kind of funny, like, 'Oh my god, is that raccoon talking? This is hilarious!'

So every week or so there's a new comedy in the theaters. Now, last year, there was like 6 or 7. It's crazy.\" Now Devine finds himself amongst the likes of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola as prominent filmmakers that have a bone to pick with the House of Ideas. After all, it was Scorsese who kicked the latest movement off nearly four years ago after he said he didn't feel Marvel movies were \"cinema.\" \"I don't see them. I tried, you know?

Ecologically, medicinally and spiritually, this special species of bee has been sacred to Mayan people for generations. \u201cThere is a god for the bees that is located in Tulum,\u201d said Ivana Carolina Canol Pech, a student studying tourism at the Mayan Intercultural University of Quintana Roo, Mexico. This god is named Ah Musen Kaab. Melipona bees, called Xunan-Kab in the Yucatec Mayan language, are different from the bee species found in the United States, Pech said. Unlike American and European bees that typically live in box hives made by human beekeepers, the Melipona bees live in the trunks of fallen trees. Mayan families that keep Melipona bees provide them roughly three-foot-long tree trunks laying in their backyards and patios, typically in rural areas that are closer to the plants the bees like to pollinate.

CONTRIBUTE TODAY . LISTEN to ICT\u2019s newscast on the go Sacred bees are vital to Mayan culture The Mayan people need the Melipona bees. Ecologically, medicinally and spiritually, this special species of bee has been sacred to Mayan people for generations. \u201cThere is a god for the bees that is located in Tulum,\u201d said Ivana Carolina Canol Pech, a student studying tourism at the Mayan Intercultural University of Quintana Roo, Mexico. This god is named Ah Musen Kaab. Melipona bees, called Xunan-Kab in the Yucatec Mayan language, are different from the bee species found in the United States, Pech said. Unlike American and European bees that typically live in box hives made by human beekeepers, the Melipona bees live in the trunks of fallen trees. Mayan families that keep Melipona bees provide them roughly three-foot-long tree trunks laying in their backyards and patios, typically in rural areas that are closer to the plants the bees like to pollinate.

One woman, Yvonne \u201cTiny\u201d DeCory, Oglala Lakota, is working to make sure all youth are included, regardless of cost barriers. On Pine Ridge, 44 percent of residents live below the poverty line with an unemployment rate of nearly 70 percent, according to 2021 census data. Many young people can\u2019t afford carnival rides, food or merchandise.

HA! That is my favorite thing Burt Ward\u2018s Robin ever said. I used to work at a summer camp when I was in my late teens and early 20s. There were many times we would all try to outdo each other with the classic Robin lines. I was not old enough to watch the show as it was premiering but it was always on some random fuzzy channel, somewhere, early in the morning or super late at night as a re-run. I really need to go back at some point and watch them all to get the full experience. For now, though, let\u2019s talk about these rad Todd McFarlane Batman 66 Retro Figures. Now, these figures that McFarlane has put out are only sorta based on the classic show. They are based more on the DC Batman 66 comic that continued the adventures from the TV series that ran from 1966 to 1968. The series was written primarily by Jeff Parker and Tom Peyer, with cover art by delightfully talented Mike Allred. It published 30 issues from 2013-16 and occasionally shows up in crossovers that my friends who have the joy of covering DC books could tell you more about. These figures are a ton of fun, though. They are designed with articulation for shelf posing and play. Those Peter-pan booties on Robin are amazing! Each figure is packaged in a card-backed blister with a 1960s-inspired vibe to it and as you can see above there is a Batmobile that looks like it is ready to roll off the TV screen. These things really do dazzle with their bright colors and retro design aesthetics. Also\u2026 Lord Death Man is a must-have just because he looks so freaking cool! Okay, have fun, go play, pre-order at this link! Until next time, this is where I hid me getting controversial and the whole article takes a wild swing into a direction that may piss people off. I\u2019m saving this for the end rather than opening with it because if you have stuck around this long you are either scrolling for images or actually want to know what I have to say. So here we go\u2026 I don\u2019t like many versions of Joker in Live Action. The classic Batman TV show Joker played by Cesar Romero is the only live-action version of the character I really like. Mark Hamill is my favorite screen Joker, with Michael Emerson as a close second but the only flesh-and-blood Joker I really really like has been played by Romero. I was not even born when the show went off the air. I\u2019m not 100% sure if my mother was even born yet, if she was she would have been super young. So it\u2019s not like I have some kind of nostalgic connection to the show. I just enjoyed the re-runs when I was a kid and think that Romero with the face paint over the mustache and the energy he brought to the role was so unhinged and creepy that it felt like The Joker. He was nightmarish and goofy at the same time without feeling like he was trying. Even if the show was not violent, the Batman 66 Joker was just terrifying in a way you could not take your eyes off him for fear he would be blowing you up or feeding you to a shark off the side of the S.S. Gotham. He was just scary.\nBased on the text above, please give a concise answer to the following question: 66' Batman figures details?.\n\n### Response:\n\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\n- The Batman 66 Retro Figures are based on the DC Batman 66 comic, which was written primarily by Jeff Parker and Tom Peyer, with cover art by Mike Allred .\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nThe article provides details about the McFarlane Batman 66 Retro Figures, including their design, articulation, and packaging.

While being pretty strapped for cash this offseason, the Rangers had no choice but to offer a short-term bridge deal rather than a long-term contract. This offers a perfect opportunity for both Miller and the organization, who will now have two seasons to prove his worth to the Rangers while the team gets to watch him grow at a reduced salary. K\u2019Andre Miller needs to prove himself on special teams Miller is currently slotted on the second penalty kill unit for the Rangers, a line that was somewhat mediocre for the Rangers in the 2022-2023 season. Throughout the course of the regular season, the Rangers\u2019 penalty kill ranked 13th in the NHL; not a devastating ranking, but also one that leaves the team with plenty of room for improvement. Chances are Miller won\u2019t be able to replace either Ryan Lindgren or Adam Fox on the first PK unit, but he will need to do everything he can to bolster that second unit. The projected line for the second penalty kill consists of Nick Bonino, Barclay Goodrow, Jacob Trouba, and Miller. This line has the potential to excel defensively with the addition of Bonino, but its success will come down to how well Miller performs. He has always been a very offensive-minded defenseman, and it\u2019s essential that he removes those traits when playing shorthanded. Miller may also get an opportunity to participate in the power play as well. In recent years, Fox has acted as the defensive quarterback on the first power play, and Trouba on the second. Fox is justified in owning that role, but fans have always questioned Trouba\u2019s presence. He has very little offensive ability, focusing solely on defense and checking. With Peter Laviolette stepping into the spotlight as head coach, there\u2019s a chance he could make this long-awaited swap and place Miller on the power play, as he has the ability to contribute offensively on top of his defensive abilities. Helping the Rangers in the offensive zone Offensive contributions have always been a strong suit for Miller throughout his career. Despite being a defenseman, Miller still ranked seventh on the Rangers in point totals last season with 43 points in 79 games played. That total ranked higher than both Kaapo Kakko and Alexis Lafreniere. While the offense isn\u2019t the first priority of a defenseman, having the ability to contribute on that end is something that helps the team tremendously. The best way for Miller to prove himself and make the most of this bridge deal will be to continue producing points on top of keeping the puck out of the Rangers\u2019 net too.

( KFOR ) \u2013 Edmond Police have released the 911 call made by one of their fellow officers, moments after she reportedly shot and killed her brother August 3. Lt. Jennifer Haddock admitted to shooting her brother, Sean, during the call which lasted nearly five minutes. Edmond Police Lieutenant shoots, kills brother, department says The call opened with Haddock quickly identifying herself to the dispatcher. \u201cHey it\u2019s Haddock,\u201d she said. \u201cI just shot my brother.\u201d Haddock, an eight-year veteran with the department, told the dispatcher she shot Sean in the chest. \u201cIs he awake?\u201d asked the dispatcher. \u201cNo,\u201d said Haddock. The dispatcher then asked if he was breathing to which Haddock replied, \u201cbarely.\u201d She can then be heard telling her mother, who was also in the apartment during the shooting, to put pressure on the gunshot wound. \u201cMom, get me a plastic bag,\u201d said Haddock on the 911 call. \u201cI need you put it on his chest.\u201d She went on to tell the dispatcher she was an off-duty police officer. \u201cI don\u2019t have an exit wound. I\u2019ve got a plastic bag over his chest,\u201d Haddock said. \u201cHe was shot with a .40 caliber pistol. He was shot in the upper right pectoral muscle.\u201d News 4 has yet to confirm if the gun used in the shooting was Haddock\u2019s service weapon.

The second the game starts, everyone in the facility is your friend. Everyone is there to see the same thing: a New England sport team victory. Huge play? High fives all around.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nCourt sides with one of the former professors suing Pacific University\nA Washington County Circuit Court judge declined last week to fully dismiss one of the multitude of lawsuits waged against Pacific University. A collection of separate lawsuits were filed in 2021 and 2022 with one thing in common: the private university in Forest Grove being named as a defendant. Most recently, a Washington County Circuit Court judge did not fully dismiss a $1.3 million case filed by a suspended Pacific University professor over his suspension and ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct. Barring a settlement, a jury trial will begin in December. Richard Paxton sued the university and a host of top administrators in May 2021. According to Paxton\u2019s attorney Robin DesCamp, Paxton was told in October 2020 that there was a complaint against him and that he could resign or face a Title IX investigation, which could end in his termination. Pacific officials say the school received numerous complaints about comments Paxton made in the classroom \u201cabout gender, gender identity, race or other protected characteristics.\u201d The university said at the time that Paxton was not cooperating with the investigation, which Paxton refuted . Pacific University asked a Washington County Circuit Court judge to dismiss all charges in Paxton\u2019s lawsuit. The motion was granted in part on Monday, July 31, meaning the lawsuit will continue to a 12-person jury trial beginning Dec. 12, unless a settlement is reached prior. DesCamp said Judge Theodore E. Sims dismissed the breach of contract, retaliation based on discrimination and Workplace Fairness Act violation claims. Sims also removed Jennifer Yruegas \u2014 who formerly served as Pacific\u2019s Title IX coordinator and associate vice president of human resources, and is currently the school\u2019s dean of the College of Business and general counsel \u2014 from being a personal defendant in the case. Still remaining, to be heard by a jury in December, are the arguments of discrimination, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Both sides see it as a win DesCamp said the claims that the judge agreed to hear at the December trial amounted to a \u201cmassive win\u201d for Paxton and potentially other plaintiffs she is representing in cases against the university. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to go into an employment case with four claims,\u201d she said, adding that more often one or two claims remain after a summary judgment. Meanwhile, Pacific University is keeping its head up in light of the dismissed claims. \u201cWe are pleased with the outcome of the hearing this past week as several claims were dismissed,\u201d said Pacific University spokesperson Blake Timm in a statement. \u201cWe feel confident that we will prevail when this case gets in front of a jury and we are happy that it is finally going to happen this year. \u201cWe have followed the law and established university policy throughout this situation. The parties have a settlement conference agreed to for October.\u201d A longer list of lawsuits Paxton\u2019s case is one of four Washington County Circuit Court lawsuits active against the university \u2014 not including a complaint in Oregon District Court at the federal level. A second lawsuit was filed in June 2021 by former professor David Scholnick. He claimed he was lied to and forced to resign by Yuergas, then-university general counsel, Title IX coordinator and associate vice president of human resources. Scholnick\u2019s 13-year career at Pacific ended in 2020. In his lawsuit, asking for $2 million from the school, it\u2019s alleged that Scholnick resigned under pressure from the school resulting from a Title IX investigation based on a complaint that Scholnick demonstrated bias against women during the tenuring process while he served as the biology department chair. DesCamp said the Scholnick claims have been settled, though the final paperwork has not yet been filed. DesCamp did not disclose how much the settlement was for. A third former professor at Pacific University joined the deluge of lawsuits in late December 2022. Rapheal \u201cJoe\u201d Hamilton was hired as an associate professor in the Pacific University College of Business in 2018 with a tenure track of three years before stepping down in June 2021. According to the $1.75 million lawsuit , Hamilton is a military veteran who suffered a traumatic brain injury in combat, and retaliation from superiors started after he requested \u2014 under the Americans with Disabilities Act \u2014 a reduction in research requirement due to the need for more time off for medical appointments in February 2020. The complaint claims Hamilton was harassed and questioned by a direct supervisor over the legitimacy of his disability. It goes on to claim he offered further medical information and applications for accommodations under the ADA to Yruegas, but she refused to even look at his documentation. Hamilton resigned in late June 2021 on the advice of his doctors, the suit says. A trial was set to begin in April 2023, but has yet to be rescheduled. DesCamp represents Paxton, Scholnick and Hamilton in their respective lawsuits. And a fourth lawsuit brought on by Peter Steele in February 2021 occurred after a woman alleged sexual assault against Steele, then a doctoral student enrolled at Pacific University. In July 2020, the university told Steele he was removed from clinical aspects of his degree. He was suspended from his program two months later. Pacific University remains named in the lawsuit for $6.27 million. A 12-person jury trial is scheduled to begin Tuesday, Aug. 8. A federal suit was brought against Pacific University by former mid-level administrator Fallon Hughes, who worked in the school of pharmacy. In her lawsuit, filed in July 2021, she said that Pacific administrators forced her to resign over \u201cperformance issues\u201d after she twice took medical leave due to illness, prior to the pandemic. Hughes also alleges that she and another female employee were targeted by a restriction on working remotely after she complained of sexism in her department, which she argues was retaliatory. The lawsuit remains open in Oregon District Court. Continued controversy Outside of the lawsuits plaguing Pacific University as a whole, Yruegas is under investigation by the Oregon State Bar for allegedly swindling investors in a side business out of over half a million dollars. The bar confirmed in December 2022 that it is investigating whether she broke the law by pocketing money from people she convinced to buy into a planned cannabis startup in 2016. Yruegas, via her attorney, denies the allegations. As for the college itself, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) set out to assess $843,000 in civil penalties against Pacific University in October, alleging the private school repeatedly broke state law by refusing to provide former employees with their personnel records. The penalties include $138,000 in penalties each for the Forest Grove-based private university\u2019s violations of law regarding former university employees Hamilton, Paxton and Scholnick. The notice also calls for another $429,000 in penalties for cases related to other current or former employees of the school. All of the complainants allege that Pacific refused them access to their personnel files as university employees, in violation of state law. In all cases, BOLI said in its notice, Pacific failed to respond to their requests despite being contacted multiple times by the state agency.\nBased on the text above, please give a concise answer to the following question: Specific allegations against professor Richard Paxton?.\n\n### Response:\n\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\n- Paxton was accused of making comments in the classroom about gender, gender identity, race, and other protected characteristics, which led to a complaint against him .\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\nSpecific allegations against professor Richard Paxton include:\n\n1.

The others were for the man who won't get to see this opportunity. Kirklin, who starred at Lutcher High School before going on to play at LSU, thought about all of that as he paced back and forth moments after the New Orleans Saints signed him. It's a moment he would have loved to have shared with Felton Wallace, his stepfather and No. 1 fan. Wallace was shot and killed in Lutcher on April 4, just four months before Kirklin's chance to fulfill an NFL dream playing for the team just 45 miles away from his hometown came to frutition. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because I wanted to celebrate that with him knowing that I was going to be home,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cIt gets you emotional just thinking about it. ... I'm home. It's just a blessing from God and I feel good to be home.\u201d Kirklin's road back close to home hasn't been easy. \u201cA rocky roller coaster,\u201d he describes it. He had a tryout with the Saints a year ago, but that workout was mostly as a defensive back. Now he\u2019s playing receiver. After the Saints didn\u2019t sign him last year, he landed with the Arizona Cardinals. He caught two touchdowns during the 2022 preseason with the Cardinals and was signed briefly to the practice squad before being let go shortly after a DUI charge. \u201cI moved past it, I learned from it,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cThat showed me I needed to lock in.\u201d He spent this spring in the XFL playing for the Houston Roughnecks. He had 253 receiving yards and four touchdowns in the first four games and made several plays that landed him on SportsCenter highlights before he tore a pectoral muscle on the opening drive in the fifth game. The Roughnecks, who started the season 4-0, went 3-3 after Kirklin went down. \u201cI feel like we would have went undefeated that whole season,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cI was on the uprise and I had that hunger in me that I wanted to show everybody I was capable of being on that next level.\u201d Making things even tougher was losing the man who helped raised him just two weeks after that season-ending injury. There still hasn't been an arrest, something that has left Kirklin frustrated. But despite the tragedy, Kirklin never gave up on his pursuit of playing in the NFL. His four games in the XFL were enough to catch the attention of several NFL teams. He had tryouts with the Atlanta Falcons and the New York Giants prior to last week\u2019s workout with the Saints. \u201cHe was a guy that we feel like kinda stood out a little bit in the XFL, both as a receiver and really particularly as a special teams player,\u201d Dennis Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s a value that he brings to that group that benefits him. He\u2019s a guy we had our eye on a little bit. We\u2019ll give him a shot and see what he can do.\u201d Signing with the Saints is one thing. Actually making the 53-man roster, especially for a receiver, is another. The Saints already have Michael Thomas, Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed as the top three receivers on the roster. Tre\u2019Quan Smith and Keith Kirkwood also look like they will earn a spot. Now it\u2019s up to Kirklin to try to beat the odds and stick on the roster. It helps that he can play either inside or outside as a receiver. \u201cWhatever they want me to play, I\u2019m going to try to be ready for that opportunity,\u201d Kirklin said. It's that willingness to do whatever is asked that has gotten Kirklin this far in the first place. He played both receiver and defensive back at LSU, but also played quarterback for the Tigers during the Texas Bowl against Kansas State because the team was shorthanded at the position. That's how versatile he is. He\u2019s won at every level, leading Lutcher to back-to-back state championships and then playing on LSU\u2019s national championship team during the 2019 season. He says playing in LSU\u2019s offense where former Saints assistant Joe Brady was the Tigers\u2019 passing game coordinator has helped him pick up on the playbook. What's not quite as familiar to him is being in the same locker room with players he grew up watching. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fanboy too much, but I really fanboy with Jimmy Graham,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cI used to play with you on Madden (video games) and dang, now I\u2019m able to play with you.\u201d Kirklin has been too busy to respond to all the congratulatory text messages from his friends back home. But he hasn\u2019t forgotten about any of them. He has a chance to be the second Lutcher High alum in as many years on the Saints' roster, following the path of veteran receiver Jarvis Landry who played here last season. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a super role model for the young kids back home,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cThey look up to me. Two-time state champion, then national champion.\u201d Kirklin will return to the place he won all three of those championships Sunday when the Saints play the Kansas City Chiefs in the preseason opener at Caesars Superdome. Kirklin isn\u2019t sure what that moment will be like, but he has an idea. \u201cI might cry again,\u201d Kirklin said. But what he does know is this.

According to the Workaholics star, Marvel is to blame for dwindling comedies, suggesting the Disney-owned studio has produced movies so large, movie-goers have not only become accustomed to seeing blockbusters rather than small-scale fare, but would rather choose to do so. \"You watch comedies nowadays and you're like, this is not a fucking comedy,\" Devine said on a recent episode of Theo Von's This Past Weekend . \"Where are the jokes? Where are the bits? There's still good [comedy] shows, but movie comedy...it's hard. My theory: I think Marvel ruined it. I feel like superhero movies ruined comedies because you go to the theater and you expect to watch something that cost $200 million to make, and comedy movies aren't that. So you're like, 'Why would I spend the same amount of money to go watch a little comedy in the theater if I can spend that and watch something that is worth $200 million?' And they still make those movies kind of funny, like, 'Oh my god, is that raccoon talking? This is hilarious!' Which it is, but it's not a real comedy\" The comedian added, \"Every studio used to put out several comedies a year and there were like 45 comedies in the theater per year. So every week or so there's a new comedy in the theaters. Now, last year, there was like 6 or 7. It's crazy.\" Now Devine finds himself amongst the likes of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola as prominent filmmakers that have a bone to pick with the House of Ideas. After all, it was Scorsese who kicked the latest movement off nearly four years ago after he said he didn't feel Marvel movies were \"cinema.\" \"I don't see them. I tried, you know? But that's not cinema,\" Scorsese told Empire at the time. \"Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.

Unlike American and European bees that typically live in box hives made by human beekeepers, the Melipona bees live in the trunks of fallen trees.

The highest navigable lake in the world has receded to what Bolivian authorities say are critically low levels due to a persistent drought. \u201cIt\u2019s completely dry,\u201d Jaime Mamani said in exasperation while walking along the new shoreline in Huarina, a farming town 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of La Paz where he is a community leader. The National Service of Naval Hydrography declared an alert in July for the iconic lake after its surface fell 2 centimeters (0.8 inches) below the drought warning stage, or 3,807.8 meters (12492.7 feet) above sea level. But the agency says this is just the beginning of a situation that is worrying Indigenous Aymara communities that rely on the lake for their livelihoods and fear the dry spell could permanently impact the region\u2019s flora and fauna.

HA! That is my favorite thing Burt Ward\u2018s Robin ever said. I used to work at a summer camp when I was in my late teens and early 20s. There were many times we would all try to outdo each other with the classic Robin lines. I was not old enough to watch the show as it was premiering but it was always on some random fuzzy channel, somewhere, early in the morning or super late at night as a re-run. I really need to go back at some point and watch them all to get the full experience. For now, though, let\u2019s talk about these rad Todd McFarlane Batman 66 Retro Figures. Now, these figures that McFarlane has put out are only sorta based on the classic show. They are based more on the DC Batman 66 comic that continued the adventures from the TV series that ran from 1966 to 1968. The series was written primarily by Jeff Parker and Tom Peyer, with cover art by delightfully talented Mike Allred. It published 30 issues from 2013-16 and occasionally shows up in crossovers that my friends who have the joy of covering DC books could tell you more about. These figures are a ton of fun, though. They are designed with articulation for shelf posing and play. Those Peter-pan booties on Robin are amazing! Each figure is packaged in a card-backed blister with a 1960s-inspired vibe to it and as you can see above there is a Batmobile that looks like it is ready to roll off the TV screen. These things really do dazzle with their bright colors and retro design aesthetics. Also\u2026 Lord Death Man is a must-have just because he looks so freaking cool! Okay, have fun, go play, pre-order at this link! Until next time, this is where I hid me getting controversial and the whole article takes a wild swing into a direction that may piss people off. I\u2019m saving this for the end rather than opening with it because if you have stuck around this long you are either scrolling for images or actually want to know what I have to say. So here we go\u2026 I don\u2019t like many versions of Joker in Live Action. The classic Batman TV show Joker played by Cesar Romero is the only live-action version of the character I really like. Mark Hamill is my favorite screen Joker, with Michael Emerson as a close second but the only flesh-and-blood Joker I really really like has been played by Romero. I was not even born when the show went off the air. I\u2019m not 100% sure if my mother was even born yet, if she was she would have been super young. So it\u2019s not like I have some kind of nostalgic connection to the show. I just enjoyed the re-runs when I was a kid and think that Romero with the face paint over the mustache and the energy he brought to the role was so unhinged and creepy that it felt like The Joker. He was nightmarish and goofy at the same time without feeling like he was trying. Even if the show was not violent, the Batman 66 Joker was just terrifying in a way you could not take your eyes off him for fear he would be blowing you up or feeding you to a shark off the side of the S.S.

While being pretty strapped for cash this offseason, the Rangers had no choice but to offer a short-term bridge deal rather than a long-term contract. This offers a perfect opportunity for both Miller and the organization, who will now have two seasons to prove his worth to the Rangers while the team gets to watch him grow at a reduced salary. K\u2019Andre Miller needs to prove himself on special teams Miller is currently slotted on the second penalty kill unit for the Rangers, a line that was somewhat mediocre for the Rangers in the 2022-2023 season. Throughout the course of the regular season, the Rangers\u2019 penalty kill ranked 13th in the NHL; not a devastating ranking, but also one that leaves the team with plenty of room for improvement. Chances are Miller won\u2019t be able to replace either Ryan Lindgren or Adam Fox on the first PK unit, but he will need to do everything he can to bolster that second unit. The projected line for the second penalty kill consists of Nick Bonino, Barclay Goodrow, Jacob Trouba, and Miller. This line has the potential to excel defensively with the addition of Bonino, but its success will come down to how well Miller performs. He has always been a very offensive-minded defenseman, and it\u2019s essential that he removes those traits when playing shorthanded. Miller may also get an opportunity to participate in the power play as well. In recent years, Fox has acted as the defensive quarterback on the first power play, and Trouba on the second. Fox is justified in owning that role, but fans have always questioned Trouba\u2019s presence. He has very little offensive ability, focusing solely on defense and checking. With Peter Laviolette stepping into the spotlight as head coach, there\u2019s a chance he could make this long-awaited swap and place Miller on the power play, as he has the ability to contribute offensively on top of his defensive abilities. Helping the Rangers in the offensive zone Offensive contributions have always been a strong suit for Miller throughout his career. Despite being a defenseman, Miller still ranked seventh on the Rangers in point totals last season with 43 points in 79 games played. That total ranked higher than both Kaapo Kakko and Alexis Lafreniere. While the offense isn\u2019t the first priority of a defenseman, having the ability to contribute on that end is something that helps the team tremendously. The best way for Miller to prove himself and make the most of this bridge deal will be to continue producing points on top of keeping the puck out of the Rangers\u2019 net too.

It is an election that experts said has motivated Ohioans across the state, prompting the high turnout. \u201cMost importantly, we are focused on making sure that every Ohioan knows that the August election is so important to our democracy here in Ohio,\u201d Chair of the Ohio Democratic Party Liz Walters said. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of grassroots energy among our bases,\u201d Chair of the Ohio Republican Party Alex Triantafilou said. \u201cThey recognize the moment here.\u201d Why Issue 1 election won\u2019t affect any potential vote on recreational marijuana Nearly 700,000 Ohioans cast their vote early in person or via absentee ballot. Compared to last August, that is nearly seven times higher, and more than three times higher compared to the May 2022 primary. In some counties, like Franklin County , Democrats have turned out in numbers five times more than Republicans for the early voting period. \u201cWe saw turnout numbers are high in certain counties, but there are a lot of places Republicans are turning out in big ways,\u201d Triantafilou said. \u201cHistorically Democrats, or the more liberals, vote more early but as we saw in the last few elections, once we start counting in-person election ballots, the Republican voters typically dominate,\u201d Republican strategist Ryan Stubenrauch said. \u201cSo once the first returns are going to show Issue 1 losing, it come down to how many turn out on Election Day.\u201d And with everything coming to a head, the state\u2019s party leaders are reminding their bases why voting in this election is important.

It is an election that experts said has motivated Ohioans across the state, prompting the high turnout. \u201cMost importantly, we are focused on making sure that every Ohioan knows that the August election is so important to our democracy here in Ohio,\u201d Chair of the Ohio Democratic Party Liz Walters said. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of grassroots energy among our bases,\u201d Chair of the Ohio Republican Party Alex Triantafilou said. \u201cThey recognize the moment here.\u201d Why Issue 1 election won\u2019t affect any potential vote on recreational marijuana Nearly 700,000 Ohioans cast their vote early in person or via absentee ballot. Compared to last August, that is nearly seven times higher, and more than three times higher compared to the May 2022 primary. In some counties, like Franklin County , Democrats have turned out in numbers five times more than Republicans for the early voting period. \u201cWe saw turnout numbers are high in certain counties, but there are a lot of places Republicans are turning out in big ways,\u201d Triantafilou said. \u201cHistorically Democrats, or the more liberals, vote more early but as we saw in the last few elections, once we start counting in-person election ballots, the Republican voters typically dominate,\u201d Republican strategist Ryan Stubenrauch said. \u201cSo once the first returns are going to show Issue 1 losing, it come down to how many turn out on Election Day.\u201d And with everything coming to a head, the state\u2019s party leaders are reminding their bases why voting in this election is important.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nCourt sides with one of the former professors suing Pacific University\nA Washington County Circuit Court judge declined last week to fully dismiss one of the multitude of lawsuits waged against Pacific University. A collection of separate lawsuits were filed in 2021 and 2022 with one thing in common: the private university in Forest Grove being named as a defendant. Most recently, a Washington County Circuit Court judge did not fully dismiss a $1.3 million case filed by a suspended Pacific University professor over his suspension and ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct. Barring a settlement, a jury trial will begin in December. Richard Paxton sued the university and a host of top administrators in May 2021. According to Paxton\u2019s attorney Robin DesCamp, Paxton was told in October 2020 that there was a complaint against him and that he could resign or face a Title IX investigation, which could end in his termination. Pacific officials say the school received numerous complaints about comments Paxton made in the classroom \u201cabout gender, gender identity, race or other protected characteristics.\u201d The university said at the time that Paxton was not cooperating with the investigation, which Paxton refuted . Pacific University asked a Washington County Circuit Court judge to dismiss all charges in Paxton\u2019s lawsuit. The motion was granted in part on Monday, July 31, meaning the lawsuit will continue to a 12-person jury trial beginning Dec. 12, unless a settlement is reached prior. DesCamp said Judge Theodore E. Sims dismissed the breach of contract, retaliation based on discrimination and Workplace Fairness Act violation claims. Sims also removed Jennifer Yruegas \u2014 who formerly served as Pacific\u2019s Title IX coordinator and associate vice president of human resources, and is currently the school\u2019s dean of the College of Business and general counsel \u2014 from being a personal defendant in the case. Still remaining, to be heard by a jury in December, are the arguments of discrimination, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Both sides see it as a win DesCamp said the claims that the judge agreed to hear at the December trial amounted to a \u201cmassive win\u201d for Paxton and potentially other plaintiffs she is representing in cases against the university. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to go into an employment case with four claims,\u201d she said, adding that more often one or two claims remain after a summary judgment. Meanwhile, Pacific University is keeping its head up in light of the dismissed claims. \u201cWe are pleased with the outcome of the hearing this past week as several claims were dismissed,\u201d said Pacific University spokesperson Blake Timm in a statement. \u201cWe feel confident that we will prevail when this case gets in front of a jury and we are happy that it is finally going to happen this year. \u201cWe have followed the law and established university policy throughout this situation. The parties have a settlement conference agreed to for October.\u201d A longer list of lawsuits Paxton\u2019s case is one of four Washington County Circuit Court lawsuits active against the university \u2014 not including a complaint in Oregon District Court at the federal level. A second lawsuit was filed in June 2021 by former professor David Scholnick. He claimed he was lied to and forced to resign by Yuergas, then-university general counsel, Title IX coordinator and associate vice president of human resources. Scholnick\u2019s 13-year career at Pacific ended in 2020. In his lawsuit, asking for $2 million from the school, it\u2019s alleged that Scholnick resigned under pressure from the school resulting from a Title IX investigation based on a complaint that Scholnick demonstrated bias against women during the tenuring process while he served as the biology department chair. DesCamp said the Scholnick claims have been settled, though the final paperwork has not yet been filed. DesCamp did not disclose how much the settlement was for. A third former professor at Pacific University joined the deluge of lawsuits in late December 2022. Rapheal \u201cJoe\u201d Hamilton was hired as an associate professor in the Pacific University College of Business in 2018 with a tenure track of three years before stepping down in June 2021. According to the $1.75 million lawsuit , Hamilton is a military veteran who suffered a traumatic brain injury in combat, and retaliation from superiors started after he requested \u2014 under the Americans with Disabilities Act \u2014 a reduction in research requirement due to the need for more time off for medical appointments in February 2020. The complaint claims Hamilton was harassed and questioned by a direct supervisor over the legitimacy of his disability. It goes on to claim he offered further medical information and applications for accommodations under the ADA to Yruegas, but she refused to even look at his documentation. Hamilton resigned in late June 2021 on the advice of his doctors, the suit says. A trial was set to begin in April 2023, but has yet to be rescheduled. DesCamp represents Paxton, Scholnick and Hamilton in their respective lawsuits. And a fourth lawsuit brought on by Peter Steele in February 2021 occurred after a woman alleged sexual assault against Steele, then a doctoral student enrolled at Pacific University. In July 2020, the university told Steele he was removed from clinical aspects of his degree. He was suspended from his program two months later. Pacific University remains named in the lawsuit for $6.27 million. A 12-person jury trial is scheduled to begin Tuesday, Aug. 8. A federal suit was brought against Pacific University by former mid-level administrator Fallon Hughes, who worked in the school of pharmacy. In her lawsuit, filed in July 2021, she said that Pacific administrators forced her to resign over \u201cperformance issues\u201d after she twice took medical leave due to illness, prior to the pandemic. Hughes also alleges that she and another female employee were targeted by a restriction on working remotely after she complained of sexism in her department, which she argues was retaliatory. The lawsuit remains open in Oregon District Court. Continued controversy Outside of the lawsuits plaguing Pacific University as a whole, Yruegas is under investigation by the Oregon State Bar for allegedly swindling investors in a side business out of over half a million dollars. The bar confirmed in December 2022 that it is investigating whether she broke the law by pocketing money from people she convinced to buy into a planned cannabis startup in 2016. Yruegas, via her attorney, denies the allegations. As for the college itself, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) set out to assess $843,000 in civil penalties against Pacific University in October, alleging the private school repeatedly broke state law by refusing to provide former employees with their personnel records. The penalties include $138,000 in penalties each for the Forest Grove-based private university\u2019s violations of law regarding former university employees Hamilton, Paxton and Scholnick. The notice also calls for another $429,000 in penalties for cases related to other current or former employees of the school. All of the complainants allege that Pacific refused them access to their personnel files as university employees, in violation of state law. In all cases, BOLI said in its notice, Pacific failed to respond to their requests despite being contacted multiple times by the state agency.\nBased on the text above, please give a concise answer to the following question: Specific allegations against professor Richard Paxton?.\n\n### Response:\n\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nRichard Paxton, a former professor at Pacific University, has filed a lawsuit against the university and several top administrators.

Pacific officials say the school received numerous complaints about comments Paxton made in the classroom \u201cabout gender, gender identity, race or other protected characteristics.\u201d The university said at the time that Paxton was not cooperating with the investigation, which Paxton refuted . Pacific University asked a Washington County Circuit Court judge to dismiss all charges in Paxton\u2019s lawsuit. The motion was granted in part on Monday, July 31, meaning the lawsuit will continue to a 12-person jury trial beginning Dec. 12, unless a settlement is reached prior. DesCamp said Judge Theodore E. Sims dismissed the breach of contract, retaliation based on discrimination and Workplace Fairness Act violation claims. Sims also removed Jennifer Yruegas \u2014 who formerly served as Pacific\u2019s Title IX coordinator and associate vice president of human resources, and is currently the school\u2019s dean of the College of Business and general counsel \u2014 from being a personal defendant in the case. Still remaining, to be heard by a jury in December, are the arguments of discrimination, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Both sides see it as a win DesCamp said the claims that the judge agreed to hear at the December trial amounted to a \u201cmassive win\u201d for Paxton and potentially other plaintiffs she is representing in cases against the university. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to go into an employment case with four claims,\u201d she said, adding that more often one or two claims remain after a summary judgment. Meanwhile, Pacific University is keeping its head up in light of the dismissed claims. \u201cWe are pleased with the outcome of the hearing this past week as several claims were dismissed,\u201d said Pacific University spokesperson Blake Timm in a statement. \u201cWe feel confident that we will prevail when this case gets in front of a jury and we are happy that it is finally going to happen this year. \u201cWe have followed the law and established university policy throughout this situation. The parties have a settlement conference agreed to for October.\u201d A longer list of lawsuits Paxton\u2019s case is one of four Washington County Circuit Court lawsuits active against the university \u2014 not including a complaint in Oregon District Court at the federal level. A second lawsuit was filed in June 2021 by former professor David Scholnick. He claimed he was lied to and forced to resign by Yuergas, then-university general counsel, Title IX coordinator and associate vice president of human resources. Scholnick\u2019s 13-year career at Pacific ended in 2020. In his lawsuit, asking for $2 million from the school, it\u2019s alleged that Scholnick resigned under pressure from the school resulting from a Title IX investigation based on a complaint that Scholnick demonstrated bias against women during the tenuring process while he served as the biology department chair. DesCamp said the Scholnick claims have been settled, though the final paperwork has not yet been filed. DesCamp did not disclose how much the settlement was for. A third former professor at Pacific University joined the deluge of lawsuits in late December 2022. Rapheal \u201cJoe\u201d Hamilton was hired as an associate professor in the Pacific University College of Business in 2018 with a tenure track of three years before stepping down in June 2021. According to the $1.75 million lawsuit , Hamilton is a military veteran who suffered a traumatic brain injury in combat, and retaliation from superiors started after he requested \u2014 under the Americans with Disabilities Act \u2014 a reduction in research requirement due to the need for more time off for medical appointments in February 2020. The complaint claims Hamilton was harassed and questioned by a direct supervisor over the legitimacy of his disability. It goes on to claim he offered further medical information and applications for accommodations under the ADA to Yruegas, but she refused to even look at his documentation. Hamilton resigned in late June 2021 on the advice of his doctors, the suit says. A trial was set to begin in April 2023, but has yet to be rescheduled. DesCamp represents Paxton, Scholnick and Hamilton in their respective lawsuits. And a fourth lawsuit brought on by Peter Steele in February 2021 occurred after a woman alleged sexual assault against Steele, then a doctoral student enrolled at Pacific University. In July 2020, the university told Steele he was removed from clinical aspects of his degree. He was suspended from his program two months later. Pacific University remains named in the lawsuit for $6.27 million. A 12-person jury trial is scheduled to begin Tuesday, Aug. 8. A federal suit was brought against Pacific University by former mid-level administrator Fallon Hughes, who worked in the school of pharmacy. In her lawsuit, filed in July 2021, she said that Pacific administrators forced her to resign over \u201cperformance issues\u201d after she twice took medical leave due to illness, prior to the pandemic. Hughes also alleges that she and another female employee were targeted by a restriction on working remotely after she complained of sexism in her department, which she argues was retaliatory. The lawsuit remains open in Oregon District Court. Continued controversy Outside of the lawsuits plaguing Pacific University as a whole, Yruegas is under investigation by the Oregon State Bar for allegedly swindling investors in a side business out of over half a million dollars. The bar confirmed in December 2022 that it is investigating whether she broke the law by pocketing money from people she convinced to buy into a planned cannabis startup in 2016. Yruegas, via her attorney, denies the allegations. As for the college itself, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) set out to assess $843,000 in civil penalties against Pacific University in October, alleging the private school repeatedly broke state law by refusing to provide former employees with their personnel records. The penalties include $138,000 in penalties each for the Forest Grove-based private university\u2019s violations of law regarding former university employees Hamilton, Paxton and Scholnick. The notice also calls for another $429,000 in penalties for cases related to other current or former employees of the school. All of the complainants allege that Pacific refused them access to their personnel files as university employees, in violation of state law. In all cases, BOLI said in its notice, Pacific failed to respond to their requests despite being contacted multiple times by the state agency.\nBased on the text above, please give a concise answer to the following question: Specific allegations against professor Richard Paxton?.\n\n### Response:\n\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\nSpecific allegations against professor Richard Paxton include:\n\n1.

The others were for the man who won't get to see this opportunity. Kirklin, who starred at Lutcher High School before going on to play at LSU, thought about all of that as he paced back and forth moments after the New Orleans Saints signed him. It's a moment he would have loved to have shared with Felton Wallace, his stepfather and No. 1 fan. Wallace was shot and killed in Lutcher on April 4, just four months before Kirklin's chance to fulfill an NFL dream playing for the team just 45 miles away from his hometown came to frutition. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because I wanted to celebrate that with him knowing that I was going to be home,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cIt gets you emotional just thinking about it. ... I'm home. It's just a blessing from God and I feel good to be home.\u201d Kirklin's road back close to home hasn't been easy. \u201cA rocky roller coaster,\u201d he describes it. He had a tryout with the Saints a year ago, but that workout was mostly as a defensive back. Now he\u2019s playing receiver. After the Saints didn\u2019t sign him last year, he landed with the Arizona Cardinals. He caught two touchdowns during the 2022 preseason with the Cardinals and was signed briefly to the practice squad before being let go shortly after a DUI charge. \u201cI moved past it, I learned from it,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cThat showed me I needed to lock in.\u201d He spent this spring in the XFL playing for the Houston Roughnecks. He had 253 receiving yards and four touchdowns in the first four games and made several plays that landed him on SportsCenter highlights before he tore a pectoral muscle on the opening drive in the fifth game. The Roughnecks, who started the season 4-0, went 3-3 after Kirklin went down. \u201cI feel like we would have went undefeated that whole season,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cI was on the uprise and I had that hunger in me that I wanted to show everybody I was capable of being on that next level.\u201d Making things even tougher was losing the man who helped raised him just two weeks after that season-ending injury. There still hasn't been an arrest, something that has left Kirklin frustrated. But despite the tragedy, Kirklin never gave up on his pursuit of playing in the NFL. His four games in the XFL were enough to catch the attention of several NFL teams. He had tryouts with the Atlanta Falcons and the New York Giants prior to last week\u2019s workout with the Saints. \u201cHe was a guy that we feel like kinda stood out a little bit in the XFL, both as a receiver and really particularly as a special teams player,\u201d Dennis Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s a value that he brings to that group that benefits him. He\u2019s a guy we had our eye on a little bit. We\u2019ll give him a shot and see what he can do.\u201d Signing with the Saints is one thing. Actually making the 53-man roster, especially for a receiver, is another. The Saints already have Michael Thomas, Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed as the top three receivers on the roster. Tre\u2019Quan Smith and Keith Kirkwood also look like they will earn a spot. Now it\u2019s up to Kirklin to try to beat the odds and stick on the roster. It helps that he can play either inside or outside as a receiver. \u201cWhatever they want me to play, I\u2019m going to try to be ready for that opportunity,\u201d Kirklin said. It's that willingness to do whatever is asked that has gotten Kirklin this far in the first place. He played both receiver and defensive back at LSU, but also played quarterback for the Tigers during the Texas Bowl against Kansas State because the team was shorthanded at the position. That's how versatile he is. He\u2019s won at every level, leading Lutcher to back-to-back state championships and then playing on LSU\u2019s national championship team during the 2019 season. He says playing in LSU\u2019s offense where former Saints assistant Joe Brady was the Tigers\u2019 passing game coordinator has helped him pick up on the playbook. What's not quite as familiar to him is being in the same locker room with players he grew up watching. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fanboy too much, but I really fanboy with Jimmy Graham,\u201d Kirklin said. \u201cI used to play with you on Madden (video games) and dang, now I\u2019m able to play with you.\u201d Kirklin has been too busy to respond to all the congratulatory text messages from his friends back home.
