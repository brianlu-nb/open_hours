He has consistently shown his ability to produce points throughout his career, ranking seventh on the team in point totals last season. This offensive prowess could be an asset to the team's power play, particularly if head coach Peter Laviolette makes the long-awaited swap and places Miller on the second unit, potentially replacing Jacob Trouba.\n\nAs for his role on the penalty kill, Miller will likely remain on the second unit, although he may see an increase in minutes due to the departure of Ryan Lindgren and Adam Fox. With the additions of Nick Bonino and Barclay Goodrow, the second unit has the potential to excel defensively, so it will be up to Miller to make sure his offensive play does not interfere with the team's defensive structure.\n\nOverall, K'Andre Miller's role in the Rangers' special teams next season will be to continue to play a defensive role on the second penalty kill unit while also showing his offensive potential on the power play.
