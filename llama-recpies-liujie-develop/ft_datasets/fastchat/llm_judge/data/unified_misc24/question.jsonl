Though average families make up most of the clientele, famous people do visit Disney Parks. In fact, one of the most regular celebrity families to visit Disneyland Resort is perhaps the most controversial \u2013 the Kardashians.\nKim Kardashian (and her ex-husband Kanye West), Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, and Kylie Jenner are regular visitors to the Southern California Disney Park. They\u2019re paying customers like other guests but usually book VIP Tours to avoid mobbing.\nBut one magical outing last year made every future Kardashian Disneyland Resort visit controversial. The family was captured on video cutting the line for Mad Tea Party and shutting down the ride for themselves.\nSince that visit went viral, Disneyland Resort guests have kept a watchful eye on the Kardashian-Jenner family. Inside the Magic reported many of their recent visits and the subsequent fan response.\nKardashians on Disneyland Rides\nIt\u2019s impossible to recount every time a reality TV star rode a Disney theme park attraction.

In a video from TikToker @explorewithbk, Khlo\u00e9 and her daughter with Tristan Thompson, True, shut down the attraction for their private use:\nAt the time, fans were upset that Khlo\u00e9 was carrying then-five-year-old True, who was old enough to walk.\n\u201cShe said move out the wayyyyy, there\u2019s poor people around,\u201d @kaaaay90999 on TikTok joked at the time.\nThe Reality TV Stars Explore the Disney Parks\nCollaborators with and fans of The Walt Disney Company, the Kardashians don\u2019t just take over attractions at Disneyland Resort.

Prosecutors claim Demons left a Fort Lauderdale-area music studio with Williams (AKA YNW Sakchaser) and Thomas (AKA YNW Juvy) in the early morning hours in a Jeep SUV and shot the two victims inside the vehicle on the side of a desolate Miramar road.\nAnother member of YNW Melly's rap crew, Cortlen Henry, drove up to Miramar Memorial Hospital in the Jeep with the bodies of Williams and Thomas, claiming they had been victims of a drive-by.\nSurveillance footage shows Demons leaving the studio in the Jeep with the two victims earlier that morning.\nBut the defense's lone witness Adrian Davis, who had left the studio as a passenger in a red Mitsubishi, claims Demons later hopped into the car with him and that they wound up back at Demons' house. On July 18, Davis testified that he and Demons found out about the killings together at the home that morning.\n\"We all were crying,\" Davis said on the stand.\nDuring cross-examination, prosecutor Kristine Bradley pressed Davis about Demons' whereabouts around the time of the shooting. Davis said he could not remember parts of the night and was sleeping on the car ride in the Mitsubishi \u2014 but he stood by the narrative that Demons was at home with him when they learned of the murders.\nDavis said lead detective Mark Moretti never interviewed him throughout his investigation.\nProsecutors claim cellphone records, the angles at which the bullets struck the victims, and testimony from medical examiners show that the narrative about the drive-by shooting was fabricated.\nFor several hours, Bradley had Moretti read through text messages between Demons and Williams, which allegedly show a dispute was brewing between the two men over money and how Demons' mother was treating Williams.\nJurors saw an exchange in late August 2018 in which the prosecution claims Williams sent Demons a message saying, \"Ain't gone lie, I'm tired of y'all getting y'all credit on shit.\"\nDemons allegedly responded by declaring in part, \"Ima pay u back for everything [you] did for me... Every idea all dat. We always gone be brothers.\"\n\"But I'll never hurt u bra,\" Demons said, according to Bradley's transcript.\nThe defense team maintains that Williams and Thomas were Demons' close friends and roommates and that there were no serious disputes between the men at the time of the mur\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: Juror In YNW Melly\u2019s Double Murder Trial Believes He\u2019s Innocent & Is Being \u2018Framed\u2019 For His Two Friends\u2019 Murders\ndate: 2023-09-08\nbody: After being on trial and charged with double murder, Florida rapper YNW Melly , 24, was recently sent back to Broward Main Jail, without bail, after the judge declared a mistrial due to a hung jury. Since, one single juror is claiming that YNW Melly\u2019s innocent and is being \u201cframed\u201d for his two friends\u2019 murders.\nRELATED : YNW Melly Allegedly Confessed To Killing 2 YNW Members, Their Families Sue For Millions\nAs we previously reported, YNW Melly, born Jamell Demons, was arrested in 2019 on first-degree murder charges for allegedly shooting two of his childhood friends: Anthony Williams and Christopher Thomas Jr. Both were aspiring rapers with the YNW collective and respectively known as YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy.\nPrior to the charges placed, the three men were being driven in a Jeep by Cortland Henry, known as YNW Bortlen, after a recording session in Fort Lauderdale on Oct. 26, 2018. Prosecutors alleged that Demons shot Williams and Thomas, while Henry is accused of being an accomplice. He is separately being tried, and is still awaiting said trial.\nRELATED : YNW Melly Prays And Blows Kiss To Victims\u2019 Families In Court During Murder Trial\nProsecutors alleged that Demons and Henry drove the bodies to an area near the Everglades before at the back and passenger seats from outside of the car, to make it appear as if they\u2019d been in a drive-by shooting. Prosecutors said that ballistics tests showed that the initial shots fired were from inside the car.\nPolice added that Henry drove to the emergency room at Memorial Hospital Miramar asking for help, claiming that Williams and Thomas had been shot in a drive-by. Both victims were then pronounced dead.\nRELATED : YNW Melly Trial: Judge Denies Defense\u2019s Motion For Mistrial, Juror Hospitalized\nWhile Broward County prosecutors were seeking the death penalty in Demons\u2019 double murder case, arguing that the shooting was part of gang action, the defense said this claim lacked credibility because Demons and the two victims were close friends. The defense argued that their client had no motive for the crime and that gun from the shooting was never recovered.\nDemons\u2019 double murder trial, which began nearly four-and-a-half years after being taken into custody, ended with a hung jury. After sitting through 19 days of arguments and testimonies, the jury deliberated for two days before announcing that they weren\u2019t able to reach a unanimous decision.\nSubsequently, Broward Circuit Court Judge John J. Murphy III thanked them for their efforts and declared a mistrial. Following the decision, it\u2019s been reported that Demons will be tried again for first-degree murder by the Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office. Demons still faces the possibility of execution if he is convicted in his retrial, which is due to begin next month.\nRELATED : YNW Melly\u2019s Double\n3. source quality: google\nHighlighted Answer from Google: Demons shot and killed two childhood friends, Christopher Thomas Jr. and Anthony Williams, in October of 2018\nProsecutors will retry double murder case against YNW Melly\n4. source quality: good\nProsecutors will retry double murder case against YNW Melly\nYNW Melly: Prosecutors will retry double murder case \u2013 NBC 6 South Florida\nSkip to content\nMain Navigation\nSearch\nSearch for:\nLocal\nWeather\nVideo\nNewsletters\nTV Listings\nLive TV\nTrending\nExpand\nYNW Melly\nProsecutors will retry double murder case against YNW Melly\nAfter a month, a judge declared a mistrial when jurors couldn't agree on a verdict\nBy\nMarissa Bagg\n\u2022\nPublished July 24, 2023\n\u2022\nUpdated on\nJuly 24, 2023\nat\n7:39 pm\nNBC Universal, Inc.\nIt\u2019s as if the month-long double murder trial against\nYNW Melly\nnever happened.\nOn Saturday, Judge John Murphy\ndeclared a mistrial\nwhen jurors couldn\u2019t agree on a verdict as to whether the South Florida rapper known \u2014 born Jamell Demons \u2014 was guilty or not guilty of double murder.\n\u201cWhat that means to me as a defense attorney who has tried dozens of jury trials, is there was somebody in that room that was \u2018gung-ho\u2019 that this should be an acquittal,\u201d said Joshua Rydell, a local criminal defense attorney following the case. \u201cThat\u2019s what this says to me.

This is the second time such an incident has occurred, the first being in July 2023 during a press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nHere is a summary of the events:\n\n- The incident happened when McConnell was asked about his plans to run for re-election in 2026. After the question was repeated, he seemed to lose his train of thought and remained silent for about 30 seconds.\n- His aides stepped in to help, repeating the question and requesting a minute.\n- Once McConnell re-engaged, he moved on to another question about Kentucky Republican gubernatorial candidate Daniel Cameron, and he managed to comment on that.\n- He also took a question about former President Trump's latest indictment in Georgia but chose not to comment on it.\n- After the press conference, McConnell's office released a statement saying he would see a doctor.\n- It is noted that McConnell is 81 years old and had a similar episode in July 2023 in Washington, D.C.\n- According to Brian Monahan, a professor of medicine and pathology who serves as an attending physician for Congress, there is no evidence suggesting either incident resulted from a stroke or seizure.\n\nDespite these incidents, McConnell continues to serve as Senate GOP leader. However, some members of the Republican party have voiced displeasure with his current status following his latest freeze, including Majorie Taylor Greene, house representative from Georgia, and Josh Hawley, senator from Missouri. </s><s> [INST] What's McConnell's health history?

McConnell plans to serve his full term as Republican leader despite questions about his health\ndate: 2023-07-28\nbody: WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said he is \u201cfine\u201d since he froze up midsentence during a press conference on Wednesday. And now his office is trying to tamp down speculation that he might not fill out his term as leader because of his health.\nIn a statement, his office said McConnell appreciates the continued support of his colleagues and \u201cplans to serve his full term in the job they overwhelmingly elected him to do.\u201d\nThe statement, first reported by Politico, comes after McConnell, 81, has suffered health problems in recent months. At his weekly press conference this week, he froze and stared vacantly for about 20 seconds before his GOP colleagues standing behind him grabbed his elbows and asked if he wanted to go back to his office. He later returned to the news conference and answered questions as if nothing had happened.\nWhen asked about the episode, he said he was \u201cfine,\u201d a statement he repeated in a hallway to reporters later that day. Neither McConnell nor his office would answer questions about whether he got medical help afterward.\nEven as McConnell tried to brush off the concerns, the episode raised new questions among his colleagues about his health and also whether McConnell, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and has served as Republican leader since 2007, might soon step aside from his leadership post.\nHe was elected to a two-year term as leader in January by a large majority of his conference, despite an insurgent challenge from Florida Sen. Rick Scott. He would be up for re-election as leader again after the 2024 elections.\nBy then, he will have to decide also if he wants to run again for another Senate term. He is up for re-election in 2026.\nIn March, McConnell suffered a concussion and a broken rib after falling and hitting his head after a dinner event at a hotel. He didn\u2019t return to the Senate for almost six weeks. He has been using a wheelchair in the airport while commuting back and forth to Kentucky. And his speech has recently sounded more halting.\nBut McConnell, famously reticent and often private about his personal life and health, has said very little about what is going on.\nRepublican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said after Wednesday\u2019s episode that McConnell\u2019s job as leader calls for more transparency than it would for others.\n\u201cWe should find out, you know, fairly soon what happened and how serious it is,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have to tell you, Mitch is also, as an individual, a pretty private guy. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he talked to McConnell on Wednesday night and he seemed \u201cstrong and alert.\u201d But he said what happened at the news conference on Wednesday was disturb\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Mitch McConnell's Health Concerns Prompt Speculation on Senate Leadership\ndate: 2023-09-12\nbody: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recently found himself under the spotlight as concerns over his health surfaced following two incidents in which he froze up on camera. In the aftermath of these episodes, McConnell and his allies swiftly mobilized to counter any potential challenges to his leadership within the Senate Republican caucus.\nNotably, McConnell faced his first-ever leadership challenge last year when Senator Rick Scott of Florida ran against him but ultimately lost. The emergence of apparent health issues raised questions about whether insurgents within the party might use this vulnerability to mount another challenge against the 81-year-old McConnell.\nSenator Mitt Romney of Utah, a vocal supporter of McConnell, acknowledged the existing efforts to replace him, stating, \"There has been an effort on the part of some to replace him already.\" McConnell, recognizing the potential window of opportunity for his critics, took action by rallying his supporters.\nSenator John Barrasso, one of McConnell's top deputies, revealed that McConnell promptly informed him of his health issues after the August freeze, displaying his characteristic dry humor by remarking, \"I just had another one of those.\" However, McConnell knew that he had to take a more personal approach to address concerns about his health. He released a doctor's letter ruling out more severe diagnoses and held a private presentation for fellow senators to discuss his health.\nOne lingering question in the Senate GOP is whether McConnell's health concerns will persist into 2024, particularly as former President Donald Trump, his political foil within the party, continues to be a dominant figure in the race for the presidential nomination. It marks the first time in nearly two decades that Senate Republicans are openly contemplating a future without McConnell at the helm.\nDespite the speculations, McConnell's allies dismiss the notion that he might be forced to step down prematurely. They maintain that his internal strength remains intact. McConnell emerged from the recent health scares with his leadership firmly intact, as indicated by interviews with more than a dozen senators who participated in his leadership contest against Scott.\nMoreover, the unpredictability of whether and when another health incident might occur adds an element of uncertainty to the situation. A previous fall in March that resulted in a concussion demonstrated the challenges of predicting such occurrences.\nWhile Senator Scott declined to entertain the idea of challenging McConnell again, it is evident that should McConnell experience another freeze-up, he will likely face heightened scrutiny. McConnell expressed his discomfort with the nationwide fixation on his physical condition during a meeting with GOP senators, specifically criticizing doctors who offered diagnoses without proper knowledge of his condition.\nThe discussion surrounding McConnell's health also drew attention to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who raised doubts about McConnell's diagnosis by Capitol physician Brian Monahan. However, Paul\n3. source quality: good\nTop US Senate Republican McConnell to serve out ... - Reuters\nTop US Senate Republican McConnell to serve out term despite health concerns | Reuters\nSkip to main content\nExclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals\nLearn more about\nRefinitiv\nReuters home\nBreakingviews\nTechnology\nInvestigations\nMore\nMy View\nRegister\nUnited States\nTop US Senate Republican McConnell to serve out term despite health concerns\nReuters\nSeptember 6, 2023\n10:04 PM UTC\nUpdated ago\nWASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he plans to serve the rest of his two-year term as party leader and his full six-year term in office, allowing for the possibility that he would step down from leadership before leaving office.\nKEY QUOTE\n\"I am going plan to finish my term as leader and I'm going to finish my Senate term,\" McConnell told reporters.\nTHE TAKE\nTwo recent episodes in which McConnell, 81,\nfroze up\nwhile in public have raised questions about how long he will continue to serve and McConnell has offered\nfew details\nas to what caused the incidents.\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) walks to the Senate floor amid ongoing talks over government funding, as the threat of an October government shutdown looms on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 6, 2023.

Here are the key points:\n\n- Kim Kardashian was a victim of a robbery in Paris during which she feared she could be raped and killed. This incident happened on the evening of October 3rd (no year specified), when she was alone in her residence. She felt her heart get tense as she heard intruders in the apartment. She tried to contact her bodyguard but her phone was taken by the assailants. She hid on the balcony until she believed the thieves were gone. When the police arrived, she was unsure if she could trust them as they were dressed similarly to her assailants.\n\n- Months after the robbery, Kim Kardashian West was reading a book about a woman's near-death experience. This incident had a significant impact on her, causing her to stay silent on social media for three months. She was said to have \"begged for her life\" during the robbery and started blaming herself after the incident.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions. </s><s> \n\n[INST] You are a helpful QA robot.\nToday is 09-27-2023.\nGiven a question from a  user: Tell me more about Kanye.\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\n1. source quality: unknown\nKanye West\nKanye West - Wikipedia\nJump to content\nSearch\nSearch\nCreate account\nLog in\nContents\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n(Top)\n1\nEarly life\n2\nMusical career\nToggle Musical career subsection\n2.1\n1996\u20132002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella\n2.2\n2003\u20132006:\nThe College Dropout\nand\nLate Registration\n2.3\n2007\u20132009:\nGraduation\n,\n808s & Heartbreak\n, and VMAs incident\n2.4\n2010\u20132012:\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\n,\nWatch the Throne\n, and\nCruel Summer\n2.5\n2013\u20132015:\nYeezus\nand the\nYeezus Tour\n2.6\n2016\u20132017:\nThe Life of Pablo\nand tour cancellation\n2.7\n2017\u20132019:\nYe\nand the Wyoming Sessions\n2.8\n2019\u2013present:\nJesus Is King\n,\nDonda\n, and\nDonda 2\n3\nMusical style\n4\nOther ventures\nToggle Other ventures subsection\n4.1\nFashion\n4.2\nBusiness ventures\n4.3\nPhilanthropy\n4.4\nActing and filmmaking\n4.5\nPresidential campaigns\n4.5.1\n2020\n4.5.2\n2024\n5\nViews\n6\nPersonal life\nToggle Personal life subsection\n6.1\nRelationships and family\n6.1.1\nKim Kardashian\n6.1.2\nOther relationships\n6.2\nLegal problems\n6.3\nReligious beliefs\n6.4\nPolitics\n6.5\nMental health\n7\nMusical impact\n8\nAwards and achievements\n9\nDiscography\n10\nVideography\n11\nTours\nToggle Tours subsection\n11.1\nHeadlining tours\n11.2\nSupporting tours\n12\nBooks\n13\nSee also\n14\nNotes\n15\nReferences\n16\nFurther reading\n17\nExternal links\nToggle the table of contents\nKanye West\nArticle\nTalk\nRead\nView source\nView history\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nAmerican rapper and producer (born 1977)\n\"Kanye\" redirects here.

STATION ESCALATORS\nNOW OPEN ON ADAMS ST. SIDE\nBROOKLYN HTS./CONCORD VILLAGE \u2014 THE ESCALATORS ON THE 90-YEAR-OLD HIGH STREET SUBWAY STATION\u2019S ADAMS STREET SIDE HAVE REOPENED, reported the Brooklyn Heights Association on Thursday, Sept. 21. The MTA completed its required 48-hour safety test for the two escalators that serve the A/C line station\u2019s Adams St. side in Concord Village. Work on the escalators on the Cadman Plaza West side of the station will begin within the next 10 days, the MTA reports.\nDuring that period, the entrance at Cadman Plaza West will remain open, and the staircase leading to and from the upper mezzanine to the lower mezzanine will be accessible. The stairwell has a number of small landings, or pauses between sets of steps, in this deep station that originally opened in June 1933.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\nNEWLY-ACCESSIBLE SUBWAY STATION OPENS\nWITH FULL FUNDING FROM MACY\u2019S\nDOWNTOWN BROOKLYN \u2014 MACY\u2019S DEPARTMENT STORE ON FULTON MALL HAS FUNDED AND BUILT A NEWLY-OPENED, FULLY-ACCESSIBLE SUBWAY STATION that is part of the building\u2019s history in Downtown Brooklyn. Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Thursday, Sept. 21, gathered in front of the Hoyt St. station (2 and 3 Trains) that is immediately adjacent to the iconic store. The full project includes the elevator and a staircase within a new street-level entrance to the station, which Macy\u2019s will maintain. This partnership is another example of the MTA engaging the private sector to improve station access without requiring MTA capital dollars on top of the 67 station accessibility upgrades included in the MTA\u2019s 2020-2024 Capital Plan.\nThe subway entrance itself is part of Macy\u2019s history, and was the transit system\u2019s first private one, according to the website ClassicNewYorkHistory.com.

DiNapoli released on Thursday, Sept. 21. Through the Nourish New York program (Nourish NY) that the New York State Department of Health and the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets jointly manage, regional food banks contract with DOH to receive these funds, allocating them to local soup kitchens, food pantries, and other community-based organizations to purchase New York grown farm products. Comptroller DiNapoli\u2019s audit found that DOH approved $22.7 million in purchases from May 2020 through March 2022, despite inadequate documentation proving the food products were grown in New York as required. DOH also failed to supply sufficient guidance to food relief organizations on coverable administrative costs.\nAuditors concluded DOH needs to improve its oversight, otherwise, funds could be improperly used for expenses not associated with Nourish NY.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\nTENTATIVE NYC SCHOOL BUS CONTRACT AGREEMENT REACHED\nCITYWIDE \u2014 THE TRANSIT UNION AND MAJOR SCHOOL BUS COMPANIES in NYC have reached a tentative contract agreement, averting a disruptive strike, according to a joint statement by NYC Council Transportation & Infrastructure Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers and Education Chair Rita Joseph. \u201cWe are glad the school bus companies and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1181 were able to come to a tentative agreement that avoids harmful disruptions for our students and families. We support increased wages and benefits for school bus drivers and a continuation of school bus services for over 80,000 students at this time,\u201d the officials said.\nThe officials warned, however, that drivers with the NYC School Bus Umbrella Services have yet to reach a deal.\n\u2730\u2730\u2730\nNEW LEADERSHIP PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT\nBIPOC-LED ARTS GROUPS IN BROOKLYN\nBOROUGHWIDE \u2014 THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM AND THE JOE AND CLARA TSAI FOUNDATION\u2019S SOCIAL JUSTICE FUND (SJF) have launched a new ten-month program, the Brooklyn Arts Leadership Collaborative, to support the leaders of eight small and midsize BIPOC-led (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) arts organizations in Brooklyn. The Collaborative, which kicks off in October 2023, will provide critical support to the inaugural cohort of arts organization leaders, including holistic leadership development and assistance in building programs to achieve their social equity goals. Each of eight organizations will receive a grant of $25,000 from the Social Justice Fund: ARTE (Art Resistance Through Education), Black Girls Sew, Brooklyn United Music and Arts Program, Kyoung\u2019s Pacific Beat, \u00a1Oye!, Black Trans Femme Artist Collective, Rooted Theater Company and Redhawk Council.\nLeaders of Brooklyn nonprofits have long struggled to sustain their organizations due to a lack of investment in the sector.

[/INST] There are three main types of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic. Here is a brief explanation of each:\n\n1. Sedimentary Rocks: These are formed from pieces of other existing rock or organic material. There are three different types of sedimentary rocks: clastic, organic (biological), and chemical. For example, clastic sedimentary rocks like sandstone form from clasts or pieces of other rocks. Organic sedimentary rocks, like coal, form from hard, biological materials like plants, shells, and bones that are compressed into rock. Chemical sedimentary rocks, like limestone, halite, and flint, form from chemical precipitation.\n\n2. Metamorphic Rocks: These are rocks that have been changed from their original form by immense heat or pressure. They have two classes: foliated and nonfoliated. Foliated rocks have a layered appearance, while nonfoliated rocks do not have this feature.\n\n3. Igneous Rocks: These are formed when molten hot material cools and solidifies. They can be formed inside of the earth (intrusive or plutonic igneous rocks) or outside/on top of Earth\u2019s crust (extrusive or volcanic igneous rocks). Examples of common intrusive rocks include granite and diorite, while extrusive rocks include basalt and obsidian.\n\nIt's important to note that these rock types can be transformed into one another via different processes, part of what's known as the rock cycle. </s><s> \n\n[INST] You are a helpful QA robot.\nToday is 09-27-2023.\nGiven a question from a  user: Explain the rock cycle.\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\n1. source quality: unknown\nNCERT Notes: The Rock Cycle [Geography Notes For UPSC]\nNCERT Notes: Rock Cycle - Processes, Forces [Geography Notes For UPSC]\nLogin\nLive Quiz\nNEW\nLogin\n+91-9243500460\nNCERT Notes: The Rock Cycle [Geography Notes For UPSC]\nThere are three main types of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic.

Any rock can transform into any other rock by passing through one or more of these processes. This creates the rock cycle.\nQ2\nWhat is meant by rock cycle?\nThe rock cycle is the process by which rocks of one kind change into rocks of another kind. There are three main kinds of rocks: igneous rock, metamorphic rock, and sedimentary rock. It can melt into magma, erode into sediment, or be pressed tightly together to become metamorphic.\nFor the updated\nUPSC Syllabus\nfor the prelims and mains examination candidates can refer to the linked article, and accordingly, start their preparation.\nVisit BYJU\u2019S for exam updates, study material and preparation tips.\nOther Related Links\nIAS General Studies Notes Links\nComments\nLeave a Comment\nCancel reply\nYour Mobile number and Email id will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\n*\nSend OTP\nDid not receive OTP?\nRequest OTP on\nVoice Call\n*\n*\nWebsite\n*\nGrade/Exam\nClass 1\nClass 2\nClass 3\nClass 4\nClass 5\nClass 6\nClass 7\nClass 8\nClass 9\nClass 10\nClass 11\nClass 12\nIAS\nCAT\nBank Exam\nGATE\n*\n*\nPost My Comment\nJoin BYJU'S Learning Program\nSubmit\nDaily Updates \u2013 13/09/2023\nUPSC Mains DAF 2023 Released\nDaily Free Current Affairs Notes\nWeekly Updates\nWeekly GK and Current Affairs Quiz Sep 09 - Sep 15\nView more...\nMonthly Updates\nGist of Yojana - August 2023\nGist of Kurukshetra - August 2023\nUPSC Monthly Magazine - August 2023\nUPSC Monthly Question Bank - August 2023\nLatest Current Affairs\nLast Updated: 03-08-2023\nSeptember Archive \u2013 Daily Posts\nSeptember 2023\nM\nT\nW\nT\nF\nS\nS\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\u00ab Aug\nCOURSES\nEXAMS\nCLASSES\nKids Learning\nClass 1\nst\n- 3\nrd\nClass 4\nth\n- 5\nth\nClass 6\nth\n- 10\nth\nClass 11\nth\n- 12\nth\nBYJU'S Tuition Centre\nEXAM PREPARATION\nRESOURCES\nCOMPANY\nFOLLOW US\nFREE TEXTBOOK SOLUTIONS\nSTATE BOARDS\nMadhya Pradesh\nWest Bengal\nFOLLOW US\n\u00a9 2023, BYJU'S.

The campaign will feature over 40 ads on monitors in Terminal 4, where the gates for Southwest and American Airlines are situated. The ads' tagline is, 'Bags may look alike.

Tania Armenta, the President & CEO of Visit Albuquerque, is enthusiastic about using this opportunity to promote the city's attractions at a busy US airport.\nPhoenix Sky Harbor is one of the top 10 busiest airports in the US. The ads by Visit Albuquerque are expected to reach over 117 million viewers. The campaign is financed by marketing funds from overnight stays at properties in the Albuquerque Tourism Marketing District. The ads will be displayed until July 2023.\nThe campaign is timed to coincide with the NFL Championship game in Glendale, Arizona, on Feb. 12, which is predicted to attract over 70,000 attendees.

It is a known fact that dogs are a man\u2019s best friend.\nDogs that end up in rescue shelters or adoption agencies are there for a lot of reasons. Their owners may have fallen ill. Their owners may have become financially ill-equipped to have pets. Some dogs have been victims of abuse.\nSome use them as breeding machines. They sell puppies as a business for income alone. When you adopt them, you are giving them a new healthy life.\nDogs are great for building emotional bonds. They can brighten up your gloomy days. So, it is a win-win situation for both of you.\n1. How Is Chicago Doing in Terms of Dog Adoption?\nIn 2017, there were a whopping 559 cases of dog adoption in Chicago. But, the number has reduced to 86 during the first quarter of 2021. Nevertheless, dog adoption has become a prevalent trend. In fact, many people have got their first dogs during the pandemic.\nAdopting dogs can be a life-changer. There are multiple options to explore for dog adoption in Chicago.\nRead on to learn about the dog adoption process in Chicago. We seek to answer every question you might have about this.\n2. Pet Adoption Rules in Chicago\nThe rules for pet adoption in Chicago are pretty basic, but let\u2019s have a quick look at them:\nYou need to be a citizen of the state.\nYou need to meet the age prescribed by the animal shelter.\nYou must only adopt from authorized sources. This means that you need to check whether the adoption center complies with the state law for animal adoption.\nYou need to have the minimum resources to ensure that you can provide the adopted pet with a healthy living condition.\n3. Popular Breeds in Chicago\nPeople adopt or buy different breeds. But, dog adoption in Chicago has been showing a preference for the French bulldog. American Kennel Club reports Golden retrievers, Labradors, German shepherds, and bulldogs are among other favorites. But the thing about adoption is that you may not always get your favorite pick from the centers.\nChicago\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: Pet Sitter Chicago, IL: Out-U-Go! Pet Care\nname: Out-U-Go!

Now, at its Cloud Next conference, Google announced that it will launch the A3 into general availability next month.\nWe\u2019ll have to see if Google Cloud will be able to keep up with demand for these chips, given that their focus is on training and serving generative AI models and large language models.\nWhen it announced the A3 last year, Google Cloud said that it would offer up to 26 exaflops of AI performance and, thanks in part to the custom IPUs, up to 10x more network bandwidth compared to the previous-generation A2 machines.\n\u201cA3 is really purpose-built to train, tune and serve incredibly demanding and scalable generative AI workloads and large language models,\u201d Mark Lohmeyer, the VP and GM for computer and ML infrastructure at Google Cloud, said during a press conference ahead of today\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt leverages a number of unique Google innovations including Google networking technologies such as their infrastructure processing and offloads, that help support the massive scale and performance that these workloads require.\u201d\n2. source quality: unknown\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Google Cloud With H100-Powered A3 VMs\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Google Cloud With H100-Powered A3 VMs\nHOME\nMAIL\nNEWS\nFINANCE\nYahoo Finance\nYahoo Finance\nSign in\nMail\nSign in\nto view your mail\nFinance\nWatchlists\nMy Portfolio\nMarkets\nNews\nVideos\nYahoo Finance Plus\nScreeners\nPersonal Finance\nCrypto\nIndustries\nContact Us\nU.S. markets close in 3 hours 4 minutes\nS&P 500\n4,513.04\n+5.38\n(+0.12%)\nDow 30\n34,794.12\n+72.21\n(+0.21%)\nNasdaq\n14,029.60\n-5.37\n(-0.04%)\nRussell 2000\n1,923.51\n+23.84\n(+1.25%)\nCrude Oil\n85.32\n+1.69\n(+2.02%)\nGold\n1,964.30\n-1.60\n(-0.08%)\nSilver\n24.59\n-0.22\n(-0.87%)\nEUR/USD\n1.0787\n-0.0058\n(-0.54%)\n10-Yr Bond\n4.1850\n+0.0920\n(+2.25%)\nGBP/USD\n1.2588\n-0.0086\n(-0.68%)\nUSD/JPY\n146.1390\n+0.6170\n(+0.42%)\nBitcoin USD\n25,837.07\n-516.16\n(-1.96%)\nCMC Crypto 200\n558.56\n-5.96\n(-1.06%)\nFTSE 100\n7,464.54\n+25.41\n(+0.34%)\nNikkei 225\n32,710.62\n+91.28\n(+0.28%)\nZacks\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Google Cloud With H100-Powered A3 VMs\nRead full article\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nGOOGL\nNVDA\nZacks Equity Research\nSeptember 1, 2023 at 8:44 AM\n\u00b7\n3 min read\nIn this article:\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nOops!\nSomething went wrong.\nPlease try again later.\nMore content below\nGOOGL\nWatchlist\nNVDA\nAlphabet\n\u2019s GOOGL Google is making efforts to strengthen its cloud segment on the back of innovative products.\nThis is evident from its latest move of making its much-awaited A3 virtual machines (VM) generally available from this month.\nA3, which was launched last year, is powered by\nNVIDIA\n\u2019s NVDA H100 Tensor Core GPUs that feature a transformer engine capable of addressing trillion-parameter models.\nA3 VMs are comprised of dual next-generation 4th Gen Intel Xeon scalable processors, eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs per VM and 2TB host memory.\nIt delivers 3.6 TB per second of bisectional bandwidth, which, in turn, enhances the supercomputing powers of the users.\nMore precisely, A3 VMs are designed to cater well to the growing demand for generative AI workloads and large language models.\nWe note that Google\u2019s partnership with NVIDIA for A3 VMs is likely to bolster its supercomputing capabilities.\nGoogle is well-poised to gain strong momentum among AI innovators and enterprises building advanced AI models.\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nStrengthening Google Cloud Offerings\nThe latest move has bolstered Google Cloud offerings.\nAlong with the general availability of A3 VMs, the company strengthened its Kubernetes offerings by launching an enterprise version of its Google Kubernetes Engine (\u201cGKE\u201d) at a Google Cloud Next event.\nGKE Enterprise aids enterprises in complex workload management while running multiple clusters by combining GKE with Anthos, Google\u2019s container platform. It is designed to address complicated Kubernetes environments as it features security and governance tools and service mesh management.\nGoogle also announced the general availability of its generative AI-backed helper, Duet AI, for Gmail, Drive, Docs and more.\nAny organization using Google Workspace will be able to benefit from this AI helper, which boasts several new capabilities. It acts as a meeting assistant for Google Chat, a document summarizer and also allows personalization for Gmail's smart replies.\nStory continues\nWe believe strengthening the Google Cloud segment remains a major Alphabet. Google Cloud has become an integral part of Alphabet, which generated revenues of $8.03 billion in the second quarter of 2023. The figure accounted for 10.8% of the quarter\u2019s total revenues and exhibited year-over-year growth of 28%.\nOur model projects Google Cloud\u2019s 2023 revenues to be $31.44 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 19.6%.\nWe believe that strengthening the Google Cloud is likely to aid Alphabet\u2019s overall financial performance. This, in turn, is expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.\nOur model projects Alphabet\u2019s total 2023 revenues at $300.45 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.2%.\nGOOGL has returned 54% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 41%.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nAlphabet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are\nApplied Materials\nAMAT and\nSalesforce\nCRM.

Choosing to buy or rent, though, is a major decision that affects your financial health, lifestyle, and personal goals. Whichever option you choose depends entirely on your lifestyle and financial situation. Both require a regular income (so you can afford the payments and associated costs) and may also require a certain degree of effort to maintain.\nBut there are several differences that make renting and owning property distinctly different. Renting a property doesn't come with all the responsibilities associated with\nhomeownership\nand you have more flexibility, as you aren't necessarily tied down to your property. Owning your home gives you a sizeable\ninvestment\n, but it does come at a big cost\u2014both upfront and over the long run.\nOwning a home isn\u2019t always better than renting, and renting is not always as simple as it seems. Here, we highlight some of the key differences between renting and buying.\nKey Takeaways\nWhether you choose to rent or buy your home depends on your financial situation, lifestyle, and personal goals.\nBoth provide you with a place to live and require regular income in order to make the payments.\nRenting offers flexibility, predictable monthly expenses, and someone to handle repairs.\nHomeownership brings intangible benefits, such as a sense of stability and pride of ownership, along with the tangible ones of tax deductions and equity.\nRenting doesn't mean you\u2019re throwing away money every month, and owning doesn't always help you build wealth in the long run.\nInvestopedia / Alex Dos Diaz\nRenting a Home\nThe biggest myth about renting is that you're throwing away money every month. This is not true. After all, you need a place to live, and that always costs money in one way or another. While it's true that you aren't building\nequity\nwith monthly rent payments, not all of the costs of homeownership always go toward building equity.\nWhen you rent, you know exactly your housing costs each month. This amount is indicated on your lease so you can plan accordingly. In some cases, your\nlandlord\nmay also include other costs within that amount, such as utilities, storage, and\nhomeowner association\n(HOA) fees if you live in a condominium.\nAs a renter, you may face rent increases each time your\nlease\nis up for renewal. These rent increases can be even steeper if you live in certain parts of town. This may not be the case if you live in an area with rent ceilings and rent control, which limit how much a landlord can increase the rent, if at all.\nRenting means you're able to move whenever your lease ends. However, it also means you could have to move suddenly if your landlord decides to sell\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Renting vs. Buying a House \u2013 How to Make a Decision, Pros & Cons\ndate: 2023-06-15\nbody: Given the hefty upfront costs associated with purchasing a home, most young people begin their independent lives renting an apartment. As they build careers, save money, and start families, many choose to buy a home. On the other end of the age spectrum, homeowners nearing retirement may choose to sell their family homes, downsize, and become renters once more.\nSince the middle of the 20th century, the U.S. homeownership rate has fluctuated between 62% and 70%. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, it\u2019s currently around 66%, up from multi-decade lows in the late 2010s. The homeowner vacancy rate is about 0.7%, compared with a rental vacancy rate of about 7%. The rental vacancy rate is usually higher than the homeowner vacancy rate, so this gap isn\u2019t particularly unusual or surprising.\nRecent U.S. Homeownership Trends & How to Think About Homeownership Today\nIn fact, despite recent gains, the homeownership rate has been depressed for many years. The decline dates back to the housing bust and financial crisis of the late 2000s, but it has several root causes:\nAging Baby Boomers moving from owner-occupied homes to cozier rental units\nHistorically high housing prices, making homeownership less affordable\nHigh mortgage interest rates, compounding affordability issues\nHigh student debt loans that prevent many younger buyers from saving enough for a down payment\nRegardless of the big-picture forces that affect homeownership rates, determining whether and when to purchase a home is a personal choice that demands careful deliberation. This decision varies from market to market \u2013 what makes sense in Peoria might not work in San Francisco, and vice versa. Also, because American culture idealizes homeownership to a certain extent, emotional and social pressures can affect the decision almost as much as financial concerns.\nWhether you\u2019re a renter interested in buying a home or a homeowner wondering whether renting makes more sense at this point in your life, it\u2019s never a bad time to evaluate the relative costs, benefits, and drawbacks of owning versus renting your home.\nCosts of Buying & Owning Your Home\nFirst, consider the costs of buying and owning a home of your own. We can break these costs down into three categories: upfront costs, recurring costs, and one-off costs that may arise during your time as a homeowner.\nUpfront & Closing Costs\nBuying a home entails numerous upfront costs. Some are paid out-of-pocket after the seller accepts your purchase offer, while others are paid at closing.\nEarnest Money\nTo show the seller you\u2019re serious about buying the property, it\u2019s customary to accompany your purchase offer with an \u201cearnest money\u201d check. Earnest money generally ranges from 1% to 3% of the home\u2019s purchase price, depending on local market conditions and the seller\u2019s preference. After accepting the offer, the seller deposits the earnest money funds into an escrow account, and the amount is credited against your closing costs.\nDown Payment\nYour down payment is the percentage of the home\u2019s purchase price that you pay upfront, typically at closing. You need to specify a down payment amount in your purchase offer, though you can change it prior to closing if the seller agrees. Your down payment amount varies widely based on your credit profile, local market conditions, and the type of mortgage loan you\u2019re approved for, but typically ranges from 3.5% (chiefly for FHA loans) to more than 20% of the purchase price.\nHome Appraisal\nTo ensure that the offer price matches the actual value of the home, lenders require a home appraisal prior to approving the loan. Appraisal costs, typically $300 to $500, are paid during or before the appraisal.\nHome Inspection\nLicensed home inspectors are trained to find potential problems and defects that might not be apparent to an inexperienced buyer doing a casual walk-through. For this reason, buyers are strongly encouraged to get one, even though private lenders rarely make loan approval conditional on a completed home inspection. The cost is similar to the appraisal and is usually paid at the inspection.\nProperty Taxes\nSince property owners pay property taxes upfront, usually in six-month increments, you need to compensate the seller for taxes paid on the period between the closing date and the end of the current tax period. This expense varies widely based on your local tax rate and the closing date. You\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

[1]\n- This trip to the beach house followed his previous visit in August 2023, when he took a weeklong vacation in Rehoboth Beach. During this vacation, he attended Mass, biked on the Gordon's Pond trail, and spent time on the private North Shores beach.

However, it's mentioned that the Secret Service is overseeing these upgrades. This has led to President Biden not being able to spend a night there for a few months as of September 2023.

Cooks in the U.S. would use them to flavor soup stock or simply toss them out\u2014a fact, learned researching this story, that disturbed me at a core, uniquely American level, though in no way surprised me (sustainability, for all its buzzword-ery, is a very new mainstream concept).\nThen a little bar in Buffalo dropped them in the deep fryer and slathered them in a buttery hot sauce. Wings became a national staple. The lowly wing went from the cheapest cut\u2014a freebie, an apparent nuisance\u2014to the most expensive part of the bird. In 2022 on Super Bowl Sunday,\nAmericans ate 1.42 billion wings\n.\nDespite not having a team, most San Diegans still recall that the Super Bowl happens every year. So I set out to find the best wings in the city. Should you still support the football arts, and wish to outsource the food for any related parties, this list should help.\nI\u2019m not sure the exact minute I began to regret this assignment, but I\u2019m certain I was gazing down at a catacomb of bones. So many of them, delicious and exhausting. It turns out that\u2014unlike\nmy earlier search for the best soup dumplings\n\u2014almost every single restaurant in San Diego does a riff on chicken wings. To feel good about the depth of my journalistic quest, I felt I had to try at least 15 of them. And now I need salad and a bath.\nA few observations on wing culture. First, wing joints are like corporations in that they tend to talk about diversity but don\u2019t really practice it. Some will have up to 60 flavors, but not let you mix and match with a single order. The first place to let you order eight wings\u2014every one a different flavor\u2014will become my spiritual center. Second, there\u2019s a lot of dry wings out there. And wings that are far too sweet.\nI get it, we\u2019re Americans, we wake up and mainline sugar. But a peace accord must be struck between sweet and savory, and if it leans one direction, I feel pretty strongly it should should be savory (\"chicken candy\" is not popular, probably for a reason). Third, restaurants that specialize in wings (or barbecue, for that matter, or any messy hand-held food) should be required to plant a tree every week to offset their napkinification of the American landscape.\nMy methodology: First, I queried food friends and social media friends for their recommendations on the city\u2019s best. Some came up multiple times and could not be ignored. I cross-referenced the rest with a little research, and told friends their diets had been discontinued because I needed help with this. I did not separate Buffalo wings from Asian-style wings.\nAll told, we tried 18 places with a reputation for thriving in the wing arts:\nO.B. Noodle House\n, Dirty Birds, Phuong Trang, Cross Street Chicken, Fort Oak,\nShank & Bone\n, Royal Mandarin, Canyon Sports Club, Mandarin Canton, Golden Chopsticks, Epic Wings, URBN, Good Seed Food Company, Tomcat Lounge, Reagle Beagle, Buffalo Wings Star, Bonchon, and City Dragon.\nI feel it\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Buffalo wing star\nDescription: This casual eatery known for wings, tenders & ribs has a selection of sauces & standard BBQ sides.\nOverall rating is 4.2\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nFriday 10 AM\u201311 PM\nSaturday 10 AM\u201311 PM\nSunday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nMonday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nTuesday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nWednesday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nAddress: 7621 Linda Vista Rd, San Diego, CA 92111\n3. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Buffalo Wild Wings\nDescription: Chain dishing up wings, tenders & burgers, plus sauces ranging from sweet to very spicy.\nOverall rating is 3.8\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant, American restaurant, Bar & grill, Takeout Restaurant, Restaurant, Sports bar\nOpen Hours: Thursday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nFriday 11 AM\u201312 AM\nSaturday 11 AM\u201312 AM\nSunday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nMonday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nTuesday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nWednesday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nAddress: 3615 Midway Dr, San Diego, CA 92110\n4. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Dirty Birds\nDescription: Sports bar wins fans with happy-hour deals on bites & brews in a woodsy-chic room with TVs galore.\nOverall rating is 4.4\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant, American restaurant, Bar, Bar & grill, Restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 12\u201310 PM\nFriday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nSaturday 11 AM\u201311 PM\nSunday 9:30 AM\u201310 PM\nMonday 12\u201310 PM\nTuesday 12\u201310 PM\nWednesday 12\u201310 PM\nAddress: 4656 Mission Blvd, San Diego, CA 92109\n5. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Epic Wings\nDescription: Counter-serve local chain that offers boneless & bone-in Buffalo wing combo meals.\nOverall rating is 4.4\nCategories: Restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nFriday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nSaturday 10 AM\u201310 PM\nSunday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nMonday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nTuesday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nWednesday 10 AM\u20139 PM\nAddress: 3904 Convoy St Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92111\n6. source quality: poor\ntitle: Chicken wings restaurants in San Diego, California: Wings mix\nDescription: Casual eatery serving wings, ribs & tenders with a variety of sauces, plus various sides.\nOverall rating is 4.2\nCategories: Chicken wings restaurant, Barbecue restaurant, Restaurant\nOpen Hours: Thursday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nFriday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nSaturday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nSunday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nMonday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nTuesday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nWednesday 10:30 AM\u20139:30 PM\nAddress: 2940 El Cajon Blvd, San Diego, CA 92104\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Mathers, III, professionally known as Eminem, objecting to the Vivek Ramaswamy campaign\u2019s use of Eminem\u2019s musical compositions.\u201d\n\u201cBMI will consider any performance of the Eminem Works by the Vivek 2024 campaign from this date forward to be a material breach of the Agreement for which BMI reserves all rights and remedies with respect thereto,\u201d the letter said.\nRamaswamy, 38, responded Monday on X: \u201cWill The REAL Slim Shady Please Stand Up? He didn\u2019t just say what I think he did, did he?\u201d\nThe post refers to one of Eminem\u2019s most popular songs, \u201cThe Real Slim Shady,\u201d released in 2000.\nBMI did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nRamaswamy grabbed headlines when he rapped Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d onstage at the Iowa State Fair. An older video, from Ramaswamy\u2019s senior year at Harvard University in 2006 when he rapped the 2002 hit under his stage name \u201cDa Vek,\u201d also went viral.\nRamaswamy isn\u2019t the first presidential candidate to get pushback from artists over use of their music. In 2015, Neil Young\u2019s longtime manager said Donald Trump was not authorized to use \"Rockin\u2019 in the Free World\" in his presidential candidacy announcement. Fifteen years earlier, George W. Bush was asked to stop playing the 1989 hit \"I Won\u2019t Back Down\" by Tom Petty.\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Eminem takes legal action against presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy for rapping his music on campaign trail\ndate: 2023-08-29\nbody: Ramaswamy, 38, is known for spitting verses from the Detroit rapper\u2019s Oscar-winning song, \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d\nEminem has sent GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter demanding he stop rapping his music on the campaign trail.\nRamaswamy, 38, who is known for spitting verses from the Detroit rapper\u2019s Oscar-winning song, \u201cLose Yourself,\u201d was given a notice last Wednesday (Aug. 23). According to the letter obtained by the Daily Mail, Eminem\u2019s lawyers recently reached out to BMI and demanded that it remove the 2024 Republican presidential hopeful\u2019s ability to use his music of any sort at campaign events.\nA spokesperson for the music licenser informed his campaign lawyer that the organization \u201creceived communications from Marshall B. Mathers, III, professionally known as Eminem, objecting to the Vivek Ramaswamy campaign\u2019s use of Eminem\u2019s musical compositions (the \u2018Eminem Works\u2019) and requesting that BMI remove all Eminem Works from the agreement.\u201d It continued, \u201cThis letter serves as notice that the Eminem Works are excluded from the agreement effective immediately. BMI will consider any performance of the Eminem Works by the Vivek 2024 campaign from this date forward to be a material breach of the agreement for which BMI reserves all rights and remedies with respect thereto.\u201d\nAccording to a statement provided to HuffPost, a spokesperson for Ramaswamy said they will obey \u201cThe Real Slim Shady\u201d hitmaker\u2019s request. \u201cVivek just got on the stage and cut loose. To the American people\u2019s chagrin, we will have to leave the rapping to the Real Slim Shady,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin wrote in an email.\nDuring an interview with POLITICO back in July, Ramaswamy told the media outlet that he has always been inspired by Eminem, as he used to perform \u201cLose Yourself\u201d at Harvard open-mic nights under the stage name Da Vek. \u201cHe\u2019s growing up in the trailers, with a single mom, and he wants to make it. He\u2019s going to use the moment to do it. He feels like he\u2019s going to use the moment to do it, he seizes it and then he makes it happen, and I thought it was a pretty cool story,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in a trailer, but I also didn\u2019t grow up in the same circumstances that most of my peers at Harvard did, either. I aspired to achieve what many of their parents did.

However, it's the first time this many representatives are in the city at one time.\nMore than 30 representatives were in town for several hours of meetings and tours at the venue after Houston was awarded host city status last June. NRG is expected to host between five to eight matches. FIFA's upcoming World Cup is anticipated to be the biggest World Cup event ever, with cities across the U.S., Mexico and Canada hosting games.\nChris Canetti, the president of the Houston 2026 World Cup Bid Committee, told KHOU 11 their still in the planning stages.\n\"We're now less than three years away from the World Cup coming to Houston and I think today is a significant moment in planning and seeing that things are ramping up and moving forward,\" Canetti said.\nAs for the next big announcement, Canetti said that'll come before the end of the year when we'll find out exactly how many games Houston will host and what rounds the city will host.\n\"We've got a lot of work to do, but our job is really to take what exists here locally and put a World Cup into that,\" said FIFA World Cup '26 Chief Strategy and Planning Officer Amy Hopfinger.\nHopfinger said there were several factors that contributed to Houston getting chosen to host games, including the city's diversity, weather and great stadium with a roof.\n\"It's a big hurdle to host such an international event like this, but we're ready for it,\" said Hari County Sports and Convention Corp. CEO Ryan Walsh.\nThe event is expected to have a massive impact on the economy in Houston. It's projected to bring in more than $1 billion to the area. But, for the hosting committee, its lasting impact is just as important.\n\"One of our visions behind this is after the games are over, what is the legacy that's left in our city,\" Canetti said. \"How can we use this World Cup to help make Houston a better place at the end of the day.\"\nMichelle Choi on social media: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n2. source quality: unknown\ntitle: 'video game tournaments in Humble, Texas: Misfits Gaming'\ndate: Sun, Oct 29, 1\u202fPM CDT\ndescription: Since 2001, eSeats.com is a trusted reseller of Misfits Gaming tickets.

The Seminoles said the move did not fully address its concerns about the ACC's revenue distribution model.\nReggie Bush sues NCAA over suggestion he was part of 'pay-for-play' plan\nEMBED <>\nMore Videos\n\"All three schools are outstanding academic and athletic institutions, and our vote against expansion does not reflect on their quality,\" Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said. \"We look forward to earning new revenue through the ACC's success incentives initiative, based on our continued excellence. We're grateful to the league for continuing to listen to our concerns.\"\nLike the Big Ten and Big 12, the ACC now will have members in at least three time zones.\nIt will span from Boston in the Northeast to Miami in South Florida, out to Dallas in the heart of the Southwest and up to Northern California, where Stanford and Cal reside. Notre Dame is currently the westernmost ACC school in South Bend, Indiana, with Louisville the farthest west among football members.\nThe ACC becomes the fourth league, along with the Southeastern Conference, Big Ten and Big 12, to have at least 16 football-playing members, starting in 2024.\nThe formation of the sprawling leagues has raised concerns about everything from the impact on athletes' travel to the changing recruiting landscape and the lost rivalries treasured by fans now facing different destinations if they want to cheer on their teams.\nStanford said it expects 22 of its 36 sports to have either no or minimal scheduling changes as the 2024 schedules are set.\n\"The ACC is really interested in using Dallas as a place where teams might come together to have games to minimize the impact of travel on both eastern members and Cal and Stanford,\" Cal Chancellor Carol Christ told reporters.\nThe move seems to signal an end to this wave of realignment among the nation's wealthiest and most powerful conferences after three years of turbulent movement that has whittled the so-called Power Five down to four.\n\"We've gone from regional-based conferences to national, coast-to-coast conferences,\" Phillips said. \"Either you get busy or you get left behind.\"\nFor the Bay Area schools, it was a marriage of desperation after the Pac-12 was picked apart by the Big Ten and Big 12.\n\"Conference affiliations and the broadcast revenue they generate provide key financial support for the wide array of sports that Stanford offers,\" athletic director Bernard Muir said. \"Joining the ACC will ensure the Power Conference competitive infrastructure and long-term media revenues that are critical for our student-athletes to compete.\"\nFor the ACC, adding three schools will increase media rights revenue from its long-term deal with ESPN and allow the conference to spread much of that new money to existing members.\nNew conference members typically - though not always - forgo a full share of revenue for several years upon entry.\nCal and Stanford will receive a partial share of ACC Tier 1 media revenue - estimated at about $25 million annually - for the next nine years before getting a full payment in the final three years of the conference's deal with ESPN, according to a person familiar with the terms. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the ACC and the schools have not disclosed the finances.\nCal and Stanford will get a 30% share in the first seven years, followed by 70% in year eight and 75% in year nine before getting the full amount, the person said.\nAnother person with direct knowledge of SMU's decision said the Dallas school currently in the American Athletic Conference will forgo all ACC media rights distribution for nine years. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the school was not making its strategy public.\nSMU President R. Gerald Turner said the school's revenues will be higher over time, and that ACC revenues will be part of the increase.\nAll three schools will immediately get full revenue shares from the ACC Network, the College Football Playoff, bowl games and NCAA men's basketball tournament units.\n\"You have the championships, the CFP fund that are coming in, part of what they've created is an incentive plan that we're all in,\" Turner said, referring also to Stanford and Cal. \"There are more ways to get funding than just the media plan.\"\nThe ACC has been generating record revenue hauls, yet is trailing the Big Ten and Southeastern conferences and staring at an even greater gap as those leagues have new TV deals kick in. The ACC's deal runs through 2036.\nThe ACC reported nearly $617 million in total revenue for the 2021-22 season, according to tax documents. That included distributing an average of $39.4 million to full members, with Notre Dame receiving a partial share (roughly $17.4 million) as a football independent.\nYet the Big Ten reported $845.6 million in total revenue (an average of $58 million in school distributions) and the SEC reported about $802 million in revenue ($49.9 million per school) for that same time period.\nThe ACC outgained the Big 12 (by roughly $136 million) in total revenue for third among the Power Five that season, though Big 12 schools received more money per school (roughly $43.6 million) with the league having just 10 members.\nThe angst over revenue led the ACC to announce plans for schools to keep more money based on their postseason success that has typically been evenly distributed to league teams.\nThe sticking point on\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

The deal is fully-guaranteed with a player option for the final year according to reports.\nVanderbilt was part of the trade package that sent Russell Westbrook to the Clippers. The 24-year-old out of Kentucky averaged 7.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game in the 2023-24 season. Vanderbilt's defense played a key role in the Lakers' Western Conference Finals run.\nWhat Vanderbilt lacks in offensive explosiveness, he makes up for with his ability to defend a wide range of athletes. He will likely contend for a spot in the starting five with Rui Hachimura, who the Lakers signed to a three-year contract worth $51 million after the 2023 season.\nVanderbilt missed the first 17 games of his only season at Kentucky with a foot injury. He proceeded to average just 17 minutes per game while grabbing 7.9 rebounds and scoring 5.9 points on average.\nThe Lakers will look to build on last year's performance as Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Austin Reaves and D'Angelo Russell will round out the starting five.\nAre you following us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or LA Sports Report yet?

According to the 24-year-old, their turnaround was prompted by a February game against the Dallas Mavericks when the Lakers erased a 27-point lead.\n\"That game was definitely the turning point of where we were at,\" Vanderbilt said in his appearance on the Run Your Race podcast . \"We were in a must-win mode for the rest of the season from that point, and that game kind of solidified us. It got us over the hump even though LeBron got hurt at that game, it kind of set us back a little bit. But at that point, everything was clicking.\"\nVando's best game as a Laker\nThe reason why this game against the Mavs was such a big deal for Vadnerbilt and the Lakers is that they realized that they had what it took to overcome a hot shooting start by the opponent that resulted in a 27-point lead.\nLed by Vaderbilt's 15 points and game-high 17 rebounds, the Lakers completed the biggest comeback in franchise history for the last 20 years. It also marked the largest comeback of the 2022-2023 NBA season.\n\"To be down 20, a fresh new team, but for us to come together and come back from 20 points on a team like that, we were like okay, we knew we were something serious,\" Vanderbilt said.\nVando's performance in this particular game perfectly depicted what he brings best to the team.\n3. source quality: good\ntitle: Jarred Vanderbilt Feels Game 2 Was Lakers\u2019 Best Chance In Western Conference Finals Against Nuggets\ndate: 2023-09-20\nbody: Jarred Vanderbilt was a player that many teams kept an eye on at the trade deadline in February due to his tenacious defense and the energy he provides whenever he is on the court. When the Los Angeles Lakers were able to acquire Vanderbilt, Malik Beasley and D\u2019Angelo Russell in the three-team trade with the Utah Jazz and Minnesota Timberwolves, the consensus was the Lakers got a steal for what they gave up.\nIt was not long before Lakers fans saw the immediate defensive impact Vanderbilt had with his debut coming against the Golden State Warriors, guarding Stephen Curry. A 6\u20198\u2033 forward who is agile with long arms and can guard point guards and forwards was the skillset the Lakers were looking for all season long with an undersized roster.\nL.A. would go on to make a deep run in the postseason with Vanderbilt taking the tasks of guarding Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant and Curry once again before reaching the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers would then play the Denver Nuggets and would ultimately get swept. A couple of months removed from the series, Vanderbilt appeared on NBA player Theo Pinson\u2019s \u2018Run Your Race\u2019 Podcast to talk about the Conference Finals:\n\u201cI think Game 2, we should\u2019ve won or that was the game we had the best chance of winning.

Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members!\nDownload the app\n.\nThe half marathon has become America\u2019s fastest-growing race distance over the years, with the number of 13.1-mile races booming along with the number of participants. In 2012, for example, 1.85 million people finished a 13.1-mile race, up nearly 15 percent from 2011, according to\nRunning USA\n. And it keeps growing, with a reported 2.1 million participants in 2018, according to the\nInternational Institute of Sports Medicine\n.\nWhy the half? For many runners, setting a 13.1-mile goal\u2014whether it\u2019s covering the distance for the first time or setting a new personal best\u2014is a reaching, yet still manageable challenge, offering nearly all the elation involved with finishing a marathon without the impact of going (and training for) twice the distance. Plus, you can bounce back quickly enough, so doing more than one or two a year isn\u2019t an unreasonable undertaking.\nThis year, whether you\u2019re running your\nfirst half marathon\nor your 15th, make the most of your 13.1-mile experience\u2014from sign-up to finish line\u2014with these top tips.\nRELATED:\n10 Things I Didn\u2019t Know About Training For A Half Marathon PR\n1. Run for a reason\nTraining for (and competing in) a long race can be an arduous endeavor, even if you already have a few of them under your belt. Regardless of whether you\u2019re a total newbie or a seasoned road warrior, ask yourself one simple question: \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d The answer to that question gives purpose to your chosen pursuit and will serve as your primary motivation throughout the training cycle as well as on race day.\nWe all have our own reasons for lacing up our running shoes, from trying something new and dropping a few pounds to running in memory of a loved one, raising money for a cause or setting a personal best. The list is endless. Whatever your reason or reasons for running, remind yourself of them regularly and never lose sight of what crossing that finish line means to you.\n2. Train for at least 13 weeks\nWhile it may seem a bit novel to allow yourself one week of training for every mile of the race, 13 weeks is long enough period of time to safely build up your long run, weekly mileage and key workouts, but not so long that you lose motivation and get stale with your training. For beginners whose longest run might only be 4 or 5 miles at the start, adding as little as a mile to your weekly long run will put you in a position to confidently cover the distance on race day. If you\u2019re an experienced runner and covering the distance isn\u2019t of concern, a 13-week training block chock full of gradually increasing mileage and challenging race-specific workouts can put you in a good position to go after a\nnew personal best\n. Once you\u2019re in shape to run a half, you can shorten your training program to about 10 weeks for your next one.\nRELATED:\nTime for a PR With Our Half Marathon Training Plan\n3. Find a shoe that works for you\nWith so many options out there, how do you know what the \u201cright\u201d half-marathon shoe is for you? Ask any running expert, and they\u2019ll tell you that the best running shoe for you is the one that you feel most comfortable in. It\u2019s really that simple.\nFeel like you need more help narrowing down to find the right pick? No worries. We\u2019ve got the\ncomplete guide\nto finding the perfect pair of shoes based on your running style, location, and experience.\n4. Then buy two\nThe miles will add up over the course of three months of half-marathon training, and one pair of shoes likely won\u2019t be enough to handle the entire load. Having two fresh pairs of shoes on hand when you start your training helps extend the life of each pair by giving them ample recovery time between workouts. Just as your body needs to recover after a long run or key workout, so do your kicks.\nIn fact, recent studies suggest that alternating between a couple different pairs of shoes in training can decrease running-related injury risk by varying the load to your musculoskeletal system. (One study found that alternating running shoes led to a 39 percent lower risk of running injury than running in the same shoes all the time.) Buying two pair of shoes can be an expensive outlay in cash, but the return on your investment can be extraordinary. Consider it an investment in your health and your ultimate race goals for the year.\n5. Recruit a half-marathon training partner\nDon\u2019t go at it alone \u2014 training is better with a buddy. A training partner can keep you excited and accountable when the miles rise, workouts get more challenging or if motivation starts to dip. They\u2019ll also be there to share every experience, celebrate with you on race day and swap epic stories afterward. It can be very tempting to stay in bed and skip a cold morning run if you\u2019re running by yourself, but knowing that you\u2019re meeting someone else to put in the work with you can be the catalyst that gets you up and out the door. If you\u2019re looking to improve your time, find a training partner who is quicker than you and let them push you to become a faster runner.\nRELATED:\nWant to Go Faster or Farther? Join a Running Group\n6. Plan a 5K and 10K too\nThree months out from your big race can seem like an eternity, so give yourself intermediate goals along the way to stay hungry and check your progress. Scheduling a 5K three to four weeks into training and a 10K three to four weeks before your half marathon will keep you motivated and provide a nice boost to your fitness while also serving as an indicator as to how well your training is coming along. These tune-up races also provide the opportunity to practice your race-day routine prior to your half marathon, which is perfect for newer runners, who can oftentimes be caught off guard by the chaotic, nerve-racking nature of a bigger event.\n7. Run on different surfaces\nDon\u2019t get caught in a running rut. It can be easy to head out the door and run the same route from your house every day or cave to the convenience of the treadmill at the gym\u2014yet again. As much as possible, try to switch up the surfaces you run on. Softer surfaces, such as grass or trails, can be great for recovery runs since the impact is less on your body, and the uneven nature of the surface can help strengthen your feet or lower legs. Running on roads can help harden your legs and work on your race rhythm, while the treadmill can help you dial in pace with laser-like precision. Much like switching up your running shoes, varying where you run can decrease the most common running-related overuse injuries.\n8. Get fast first\nIf you\u2019re an experienced half marathoner targeting a PR this year,\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1. Use only the information you've discovered to answer the question. Do not make up information.\n2. Pay special attention to the information such as time, location, and people involved.

However, following a disappointing performance, the US was the victim of a huge upset.\nAs expected, the semifinal match-up got off to a tight start. Neither team was able to take control throughout the opening two quarters with the US taking a slight 60-59 lead into halftime.\nHowever, the third quarter saw the tide change and Germany seized its opportunity, catching the US sleeping following the break.\nGermany outscored the US 35-24 in the third quarter and took a crucial 10-point lead into the final 10 minutes of the semifinal clash.\nLed by Anthony Edwards and Austin Reaves, Team USA rallied in the fourth and a final quarter comeback looked to be on, but it proved to be too little, too late.\nGermany held on resolutely, making key plays in the clutch, to book a spot in the FIBA Basketball World Cup final.\nThe loss represents another disappointing World Cup campaign for the US.\nDespite taking a team full of NBA stars including Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson, it marks the second consecutive World Cup where the US has failed to reach the championship game.\n\u201cTerrible. Plain and simple,\u201d Brunson told reporters of his performance against Germany.\n\u201cWe knew the task at hand, that was to go and win and we didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Reaves added following the defeat.\n\u201cThe game has been globalized over the last 30 years or so. These games are difficult. This is not 1992 anymore,\u201d US head coach Steve Kerr told reporters postgame. \u201cPlayers are better all over the world. Teams are better. It\u2019s not easy to win a World Cup or an Olympic Games.\u201d\nThe Germany team boasted a host of NBA players with Dennis Schr\u00f6der, Franz Wagner and Daniel Theis playing key roles\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: There will be no gold for the USA at the Basketball World Cup, after 113-111 loss to Germany\ndate: 2023-09-08\nbody: AP Basketball Writer\nMANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 There will be no gold medal for the U.S. at this World Cup. And for the second consecutive time in FIBA\u2019s biggest tournament, there might not be any medal at all for the Americans.\nInstead, it\u2019s Germany on the cusp of a world title.\nAndreas Obst scored 24 points, Franz Wagner added 22 and Germany scored more points than any team ever has against a USA Basketball team featuring NBA players \u2014 earning a 113-111 win in the World Cup semifinals on Friday night.\n\u201cThis team is very worthy of winning a championship,\u201d U.S. coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cAnd we just didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d\nNo, it didn\u2019t, and now questions will fly once again. USA Basketball has been talking for years about how the continuity of top international teams has closed what was once a sizable gap between the Americans and the rest of the world. The U.S. has won the last four Olympic titles, but now it\u2019s two straight World Cups with no gold for the winningest program on the planet.\n\u201cTerrible,\u201d U.S. guard and captain Jalen Brunson said. \u201cPlain and simple.\u201d\nGermany \u2014 the last unbeaten team left in the tournament at 7-0 \u2014 will play Serbia on Sunday (8:40 a.m. EDT) for the World Cup title.

The U.S. beat Germany 99-91 on Aug. 20 in Abu Dhabi, rallying from a 16-point second-half deficit and needing an 18-0 run down the stretch to take control.\nThat game was a scrimmage, meaningless, the final tune-up before the World Cup. Friday\u2019s game will be very, very different.\n\u201cWe set ourselves high goals and it's going to be a challenge,\u201d Germany's Johannes Thiemann said. \u201cBut with those goals in mind, we have to beat teams like the U.S. And hopefully we're able to do that.\u201d\nAndreas Obst scored 13 for Germany (6-0), which survived on a night where Dennis Schroder was 4 for 26 from the floor and scored nine points.\nArturs Zagars scored 24 and Davis Bertans scored 20 for Latvia (4-2).\n\u201cAll I want to say is that I'm extremely proud of this team, battling every single game,\u201d said Bertans, who took a deep 3-pointer for the lead with about 5 seconds left \u2014 then watched it hit the rim and bounce away.\nWith the win, Germany is assured of no worse than its second-best finish in basketball\u2019s top two international events \u2014 the World Cup and the Olympics.

{"question_id": 109, "query": "Discuss his 'Jeopardy!' stint.", "turns": ["This is the conversation history with the user: [INST] What NFL teams will win the Super Bowl this year Answer in a humor tone [/INST] Well, if I had a crystal ball, I'd tell you the exact winner of the Super Bowl this year, but I'm a robot, not a fortune teller! However, based on the information I found, here's a humorous take:\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers, and Cincinnati Bengals are busy stretching, doing squats, and practicing touchdown dances because they are the top five favorites to win Super Bowl 58. But, keep an eye on the New York Jets too. They've got Aaron Rodgers, and it seems they're planning to hustle hard this year. \n\nBut remember, this is football, not a scripted movie. Anything can happen! Just ask the New England Patriots, who, according to one projection model, are as likely to reach the playoffs as a robot like me is likely to win the lottery! \n\nKeep in mind that these are all predictions and the actual outcome might be different. After all, the ball is oval, it bounces in unpredictable ways! </s><s> [INST] Tell me more about Rodgers. [/INST] Aaron Rodgers is a renowned NFL quarterback, born on December 2, 1983, in Chico, California. He had a successful career with the Green Bay Packers, leading them to a Super Bowl XLV victory and winning four MVP awards. Here are some key points about him:\n\n- He played for the University of California at Berkeley during his college years, where he was a star player before being drafted by the Packers in 2005.\n- Rodgers got his chance to quarterback the team as a starter in Green Bay in 2008. He led the Packers to victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV and won MVP honors.\n- During his time with the Packers, Rodgers set numerous NFL passing records and continued to maintain his spot among football's top performers.\n- He won his third and fourth NFL MVP awards for the 2020 and 2021 seasons.\n- Despite his successful career with the Packers, there was speculation that Rodgers might retire or demand a trade out of Green Bay. Instead, the Packers signed him to a contract extension in March 2022 worth $150.8 million over three seasons.\n- In March 2023, Rodgers moved to the New York Jets. This move was viewed positively by many NFL analysts as it was expected to make the Jets a Super Bowl contender.\n- Unfortunately, in his season debut on September 11, 2023, Rodgers suffered a season-ending torn Achilles in his left leg. \n\nApart from his football career, Rodgers has also served as a guest host of the popular trivia game show 'Jeopardy!' for 10 episodes in April 2021, raising $236,725 for charity during his appearance.

Answer in a humor tone [/INST] Well, howdy from the world of artificial intelligence! Now let's talk about climate change, shall we? Imagine if Earth decided to change its entire wardrobe because it got bored of its usual attire. Well, that's kind of like climate change! But instead of clothes, we're talking about long-term changes in average weather patterns that define Earth's local, regional, and global climates. \n\nNow, don't get it mixed up with weather. Weather is what you complain about when it's too hot for your BBQ party, while climate is what polar bears complain about when their ice-cream...I mean, ice caps start melting!\n\nHere are a few fun, but also kinda scary, facts about climate change based on the information I found:\n\n- Human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, are the main culprits behind climate change because they increase heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in our atmosphere. It's like throwing a huge, non-stop party in your house, and the heat from all the guests just keeps building up. Not the coolest party, right?\n\n- Since the pre-industrial period, human activities have heated up Earth's average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius. Doesn't sound like much, but trust me, our planet is sweating!\n\n- Climate change is causing all sorts of effects, like rising sea levels, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events like hurricanes and heatwaves, and changes in cloud and vegetation cover. Basically, Earth's throwing a tantrum because of the heat!\n\n- The term \"global warming\" is not the same as \"climate change.\" Global warming refers to the long-term heating of Earth\u2019s surface observed since the pre-industrial period due to human activities. \n\nSo, let's turn down the heat and help Earth cool off a bit, shall we? </s><s> \n\n[INST] You are a helpful QA robot.\nToday is 09-27-2023.\nGiven a question from a  user: Use simpler language\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\n1. source quality: google\nHighlighted Answer from Google: a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates\nWhat Is Climate Change? | Facts\n\n2. source quality: poor\nWhat Is Climate Change? | Facts\nWhat Is Climate Change? | Facts \u2013 Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet\nNASA\nGlobal Climate Change\nVital Signs of the Planet\nSkip Navigation\nmenu\nclose modal\nWhat Is Climate Change?\nClimate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth\u2019s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.\nChanges observed in Earth\u2019s climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, raising Earth\u2019s average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity,\nchanges in the Sun\u2019s energy output\n,\nvariations in Earth\u2019s orbit\n).\nScientists use observations from the ground, air, and space, along with\ncomputer\nmodels\n, to monitor and study past, present, and future climate change. Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at Earth\u2019s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes.\n\u201cClimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms \"weather\" and \"climate\" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales.\nWhat Is Global Warming?\nThis graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures, with the year 2020 statistically tying with 2016 for hottest on record (Source:\nNASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies\n). Learn more about global surface temperature\nhere\n. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal warming is the long-term heating of Earth\u2019s surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the term \"climate change.\"\nSince the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth\u2019s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by more than 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. The current warming trend is unequivocally the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over millennia.\nWeather vs. Climate\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.\u201d\n- Mark Twain\nWeather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of time\u2014from minutes to hours or days.

Now, they have 11 dogs and 10 cats left to adopt before the shelter begins to relocate.\nThe shelter's founder, Davis Cozy, passed away in 2022. Since then, Gibbs said she's done everything she can to keep the place going in his memory.\nAside from finding \"fur-ever\" homes for the puppies and kittens left in their litter, FOPAS is also fundraising for the shelter's new home.\n\"I have started FOPAS over \u2014 adoption center wise \u2014 so many times and, each time, something happens,\" Gibbs said. \"And then, we have to leave. And then, we've done things to the property to better house our animals. And then, we lose it. I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not getting a new owner. I've been doing this too many years.\"\nThe Friends of Perry Animal Shelter is holding fundraising events until the end of the year.

In most attacks, bears are trying to defend their food, cubs or space.\nThere are steps people can take to help prevent a bear encounter from becoming a bear attack.\nIdentify yourself: Talk calmly and slowly wave your arms. This can help the bear realize you\u2019re a human and nonthreatening.\nStay calm: Bears usually don\u2019t want to attack; they want to be left alone. Talk slowly and with a low voice to the bear.\nDon\u2019t scream: Screaming could trigger an attack.\nPick up small children: Don\u2019t let kids run away from the bear. It could think they\u2019re small prey.\nHike in groups: A group is noisier and smellier, the National Park Service said. Bears like to keep their distance from groups of people.\nMake yourself look big: Move to higher ground and stand tall. Don\u2019t make any sudden movements.\nDon\u2019t drop your bag: A bag on your back can keep a bear from accessing food, and it can provide protection.\nWalk away slowly: Move sideways so you appear less threatening to the bear. This also lets you keep an eye out.\nAgain, don\u2019t run: Bears will chase you, just like a dog would.\nDon\u2019t climb trees:\n5. source quality: good\nMan attacked by grizzly bear in Big Sky remains in critical ...\nPlease ensure Javascript is enabled for purposes of\nwebsite accessibility\nMan attacked by grizzly bear in Big Sky remains in critical but stable condition | KECI\nWed, 13 Sep 2023 22:45:05 GMT (1694645105086)\nf21546d3a7b92848c6890935ca4e2b625f015352\n4a6d0bb8f30f1b6a167248fbd029e9fd6e7edbb4\nNews\nWeather\nSports\nGame Center\nChime In\nWatch\nNow\n52\nWed\n75\nThu\n78\nMan attacked by grizzly bear in Big Sky remains in critical but stable condition\nby\nBryanna Carroll\nTue, September 12th 2023, 2:54 AM UTC\nA man attacked by a grizzly bear just south of Big Sky in the Yellow Mule Area has been identified as Rudy Noorlander, according to a GoFundMe campaign organized by his daughter, Katelynn Noorlander.\nLoading ...\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Just like the rest of her body, she can control her tail muscles by thinking in order to manipulate movement. She can wag, lower or raise her tail at will, and she can stop it mid-wag, too. Some\nbreeds balance using their tails\n, so it\u2019s necessary to be able to control the muscles that control the tail.\nSocial Behavior\nPuppies don\u2019t wag their tails immediately after birth so many experts believe tail wagging is a socially learned behavior. The tail functions as an emotional barometer letting dogs communicate with their littermates, pack and other peers.\nHumans associate a wagging tail with a happiness\n; however, the angle and nature of the movement could also mean frustration, anger or agitation.\nStop and Go\nWhile dogs control the movement, they may not always start the wag. It appears they will start wagging out of instinct, not conscious thought, similar to when humans frown. Frowning might be ingrained as a response to a bad joke, but you can actively return your mouth to a smile.\nOther Movements\nIf you\u2019re not sure what your dog is communicating with her tail wag, look at the rest of the body to understand further. For example, if she is relaxed (ears loose, light panting), the wagging may indicate happiness. Conversely, when intimidated,\ndogs lower their tails\n. Each dog appears to have its own reactions and movements, so be sure to use all of the clues possible when trying to interpret your dog\u2019s emotions.\nWant to learn more about your pup?

(1/3) pic.twitter.com/OHGlyvjcAm\n\u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 5, 2023\nThe letter from law firms Davis Polk and Munger Tolles & Olson comes after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled last week that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF without adequately explaining its reasoning. The ruling requires the SEC to review Grayscale's application again, although the agency still has time to appeal.\n\"We believe the commission should conclude that there are no grounds for treating the trust differently from ETPs [exchange-traded products] that invest in Bitcoin futures contracts,\" the lawyers wrote, citing Bitcoin futures ETFs that the SEC has already approved.\nGrayscale has argued that its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF should be approved because it would rely on the same market surveillance arrangement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that the SEC has deemed sufficient for Bitcoin futures ETFs. The appeals court agreed, ruling that the SEC never explained why the two arrangements were materially different.\n\"If any other reason could be offered in attempting to differentiate spot Bitcoin ETPs from Bitcoin futures ETPs...we are confident that it would have surfaced by now,\" the lawyers stated.\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would give mainstream investors exposure to Bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency directly.

I\u2019m looking forward to the staff's recommendations.\u201d\nLast month, a judge ruled that the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application must be reviewed, siding with Grayscale in its lawsuit against the regulator.\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is the hottest topic in the crypto world right now; the SEC has for years denied applications for the product, which would allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset.\nBut investors are hungry for a product\u2014including institutions\u2014because it would give them direct exposure to the crypto world in a safer and easier way.\nToday, asset manager Franklin Templeton became the latest Wall Street giant to enter the Bitcoin ETF race by filing an SEC application for a \u201cFranklin Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\nOther big names hoping to get their product approved include BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, and Boston-based investment giant Fidelity.\nGensler today reiterated that he thought the industry was a Wild West of noncompliance. \u201cIt\u2019s a field which is rife with fraud, abuse, and misconduct,\u201d he told lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers have criticized Gensler for not being clear-cut enough with what he wants from crypto companies, and in turn stifling innovation.\nUnder his watch, the top regulator has cracked down hard on the digital asset industry, hitting major crypto brands like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and others with lawsuits.\n3. source quality: unknown\ntitle: Bitcoin ETF race back on as Franklin Templeton steps up to the plate\ndate: 2023-09-13\nbody: Bitcoin ETF race back on as Franklin Templeton steps up to the plate\nFranklin Templeton, the long-running US investment firm with over a trillion dollars under management, has joined the race to become the first traditional finance institution with a spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on offer.\nThe firm filed its intentions with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), naming Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) as crypto custodian and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) as cash custodian.\nFranklin Templeton thus joins GrayScale, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest, WisdomTree and numerous other major financial institutions in pressuring the US securities regulator into approving spot-bitcoin ETFs.\nAn investment vehicle of this kind would give retail and institutional investors access to bitcoin on the traditional stock exchange, potentially opening the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency up to trillions of dollars of untapped wealth.\nHowever, the SEC has snubbed any and all applications since 201, when the Winklevoss Twins\u2019 Gemini crypto exchange became the first to apply for a spot-bitcoin ETF.\nA maiden approval has become a holy grail of sorts for the cryptocurrency sector, and though the SEC has shown animosity to the idea on the ground that the bitcoin markets are prone to fraud and manipulation, a recent court win for Grayscale has pushed the dial closer to victory.\nBitcoin sent higher\nBitcoin bounced higher on news of Franklin Templeton\u2019s application, hitting highs of $28,570 on Tuesday. BTC/USDT saw a bit of a correction after this peak, though still managed to close the session 2.7% higher at $25,840.\nThe pair added another 0.5% in this morning\u2019s Asia trades, bringing bitcoin up to $25,979 at the time of writing.\nBTC/USDT is 3.7% higher over six months \u2013 Source: tradingview.com\nThe short but unexpected rally caught the puts off guard, causing nearly $38 million in short liquidations on the futures market against $15 million in long liquidations.\nEthereum (ETH) enjoyed a boost on Tuesday, closing \n4. source quality: good\nGrayscale Prods SEC to Approve Bitcoin Spot ETF After ...\nGrayscale Prods SEC to Approve Bitcoin Spot ETF After Court Victory - Decrypt\nGrayscale Prods SEC to Approve Bitcoin Spot ETF After Court Victory\nCoin Prices\nBitcoin\n$26,227.00\n1.26%\nEthereum\n$1,617.60\n1.89%\nBNB\n$211.70\n0.91%\nXRP\n$0.483657\n0.98%\nCardano\n$0.247301\n1.18%\nDogecoin\n$0.06125\n0.96%\nSolana\n$18.75\n5.36%\nTRON\n$0.081151\n0.82%\nPolkadot\n$3.99\n0.61%\nPolygon\n$0.516447\n1.26%\nLitecoin\n$62.34\n4.17%\nShiba Inu\n$0.00000726\n1.10%\nWrapped Bitcoin\n$26,217.00\n1.36%\nBitcoin Cash\n$200.37\n1.70%\nLEO Token\n$3.65\n-0.52%\nAvalanche\n$9.32\n1.49%\nStellar\n$0.119263\n-0.76%\nChainlink\n$6.03\n1.25%\nUniswap\n$4.27\n1.76%\nMonero\n$143.68\n0.66%\nOKB\n$42.26\n1.68%\nEthereum Classic\n$15.06\n0.76%\nCosmos Hub\n$6.53\n2.05%\nFilecoin\n$3.17\n1.90%\nCronos\n$0.050569\n0.78%\nLido DAO\n$1.49\n1.87%\nInternet Computer\n$2.93\n-0.21%\nAptos\n$5.19\n2.06%\nVeChain\n$0.01627751\n1.76%\n\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

A procession of freshmen, transfer and international students passed through the Weber Arch , the university\u2019s iconic entryway at Sheridan Road and Chicago Avenue in Evanston, signifying the start of their university experience.\nMost Northwestern freshmen and transfer students began moving into residence halls on Monday. Returning students are expected to join them Saturday, before classes start next week. The mood on campus was jubilant Tuesday as incoming students waved purple and white pompoms while their family members \u2014 some teary-eyed \u2014 looked on and shot photos.\nYet the Northwestern University Class of 2027 has arrived in the wake of great turmoil within the university\u2019s athletics department, starting with allegations of rampant hazing of players on the football team and then spiraling into numerous claims of abusive behavior and toxic cultures pervading multiple sports teams.\nThe prestigious university now faces a litany of lawsuits stemming from the complaints of former college athletes as well as a lawsuit filed by several former baseball team staffers . In response, Northwestern is having former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch conduct a review of the university and its athletics department. In a Tribune opinion piece, University President Michael Schill last month apologized \u201con behalf of the university to those athletes and all others affected\u201d and has pledged that hazing will not be tolerated at Northwestern.\n\u201cObviously the scandals are what they are,\u201d Holliday said, as the last few incoming students filed through the Arch. \u201cThat is absolutely something we want to make sure is solved and no other kid has to endure any of the alleged circumstances.\u201d\nYet he hopes the spotlight on hazing and its consequences might prove to be a turning point, spurring Northwestern \u2014 and perhaps other colleges and universities as well \u2014 to become better communities and safer havens for students in the long run.\n\u201cWe trust them. We\u2019re giving our kids to them,\u201d said Holliday, who like so many family members wore a purple Northwestern shirt for the start-of-the-academic-year festivities. \u201cSo we hope that not only Northwestern, after this is all settled, will be a better place and safer place for our kids, but that all institutions across the country will do the same.\u201d\nAfter March Through the Arch concluded, the incoming students and their loved ones gathered at Deering Meadow, a 2-acre green space outside the university library that was once the site of the first Northwestern football field.\nPresident Schill addressed the crowd, noting that the day marked one year since he took office.\n\u201cWelcome to your new home,\u201d he said, as the crowd cheered. \u201cYou are all Wildcats now. You now belong fully to a global family of Northwestern people who care for one another and bring out the very, very best in each other.\u201d\nThe message was in stark contrast to the claims of many former Northwestern athletes \u2014 representing an array of sports including volleyball, lacrosse, softball, baseball and football \u2014 who have recently filed lawsuits against the university.\n\u201cI was conditioned to think this stuff is normal, and this was what goes on in college football, this is\n2. source quality: good\ntitle: Head Coach Dismissed in Wake of Northwestern University's Hazing Scandal\ndate: 2023-09-05\nbody: video by @NBCChicago\nNorthwestern University has let go of its long-standing head football coach amid claims of widespread hazing and racism. Both the football and baseball coaching staff were implicated in the accusations, resulting in a thorough, six-month investigation initiated by the university. Several former athletes relayed instances of troubling experiences, provoking them to press charges against the school.\nConsequently, the university insisted that the football team participate in comprehensive anti-hazing training, led by consulting firm Protection All. The university's Athletic Director, Derrick Gragg, has commended the team's courage during this stressful period. Gragg emphasized that the players' behaviors should uphold the honor of themselves, their families, and the university in the future.\nThe reaction from the university, however, has not entirely neutralized the situation. Several alumni associations are scrutinizing the correlation between the university's actions and Northwestern\u2019s overall athletics culture. However, Gragg reassured the community, declaring that a thoughtful strategy is in place to progress and there are no plans for additional personnel changes.\nMore details:\n[1] Northwestern AD: Teams Took Misconduct Training 'Very Seriously' After Hazing Scandal\n[2] Northwestern AD Derrick Gragg lauds football team's 'resilience' in wake of hazing scandal\nThe post includes content assisted by AI tools.

That complaint claimed the hazing involved student athletes and may have begun during the team\u2019s training camp activities in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\nDec. 2022\n: Northwestern hired attorney Maggie Hickey, of the law firm ArentFox Schiff, to conduct an investigation into the hazing allegation.\nJuly 7\n: After Hickey\u2019s investigation is complete, Northwestern University President Michael Schill announced Fitzgerald has been suspended for two weeks without pay. While that investigation did not find sufficient evidence that the coaching staff knew about ongoing hazing, Hickey did find that there were \u201csignificant opportunities\u201d to find out about and report the conduct.\nThe university also announced additional steps in response to Hickey\u2019s report, including: ending the football team\u2019s Kenosha training camp, requiring an outside monitor in the team\u2019s locker room who doesn\u2019t report to the football coaching staff, and creating an online portal for student athletes to anonymously report hazing or hazing-related concerns.\nJuly 8\n:\nThe Daily Northwestern\n, the university\u2019s student newspaper, published details from a former football player who described the hazing he\u2019d seen as \u201cegregious and vile and inhumane behavior.\u201d The player said some of that hazing involved coerced sexual acts \u2014 allegations that a second player also told the paper \u2014 and that Fitzgerald may have known that hazing took place.\nAccording to The Daily, the player described a hazing activity he referred to as \u201crunning,\u201d which was used to punish players for mistakes made during games or practice. When this occurred, the selected player would be restrained by several upperclassmen wearing \u201cPurge-\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Here are the main points based on the information I found:\n\n- The French government announced the ban on abayas last month. Abaya is a long, loose-fitting dress often worn by Muslim women [1,4].\n- On the first day of the new academic year, nearly 300 students arrived at school wearing abayas. Those who refused to remove them were sent home [1,2,3].\n- This move is seen as part of the rules on secularism in education in France. In fact, head coverings, including the hijab, were first banned in French public schools back in 2004 [1,3].\n- The ban is currently being challenged by a rights group, Action Droits Des Musulmans (ADM). Their main argument is that the abaya has not been formally classified as a religious item and the ban infringes on \"fundamental rights,\" such as the right to personal liberty [2].\n- France's administrative law requires a decision on the appeal to be handed down by the State Council within 48 hours of the hearing [2]. \n\nPlease note that while the ban is implemented, the appeal process against it is ongoing. </s><s> \n\n[INST] You are a helpful QA robot.\nToday is 09-27-2023.\nGiven a question from a  user: Update on the appeal decision?\nAnswer the question based on the following information you find:\n1. source quality: good\ntitle: French schools turn away girls wearing abayas as Muslim rights group challenges ban\ndate: 2023-09-06\nbody: Public schools in France have been turning away students for breaking a new national ban on the abaya , a long, robe-like garment often worn by Muslim women, as a rights group filed an appeal against the prohibition.\nA total of 67 girls returned home rather than remove their abayas, Education Minister Gabriel Attal told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday.\nAcross the country a total of 298 pupils arrived at school wearing abayas, but a \u201clarge majority\u201d agreed to remove them, said Attal, who added that the new rule had been followed \u201cwithout any major difficulty to report\u201d as the country\u2019s schools began the new academic year on Monday.\nAttal announced the ban on abayas in schools on Sunday, but by Tuesday the State Council, France\u2019s highest court for complaints against state authorities, had heard an appeal from the Action Droits Des Musulmans (ADM) group.\nThe group\u2019s lawyer, Vincent Brengarth, told journalists before the hearing that the ban is \u201cnot based on any legal text.\u201d\nIn a separate interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday evening, Brengarth said the ban has been imposed in an \u201carbitrary\u201d manner as it contains no legal definition of what an abaya looks like.

(Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\nA couple faces criminal charges after allegedly trashing a Burger King in Arizona and challenging employees to a fight over her wait time in the drive-thru and the number of chicken nuggets in a value pack.\nIt happened Saturday afternoon at the eatery on John Wayne Parkway in the city of Maricopa. The incident started when Sheree Nichelle Ross, 44, became impatient at how long it was taking to get her food and threw a cup through the drive-thru, a probable cause affidavit obtained by Law&Crime shows. Related Coverage:\nWhen a worker threw the cup back to her, Ross pulled the car over and went into the store, accompanied by her husband Tavarus Ross, 43, and another woman who has not been identified, police said.\nThe trio proceeded to allegedly throw displays and challenge employees to fight.\n\u201cTavarus reportedly told an employee to have his manager clock out so he could fight her,\u201d the affidavit states. Ross also told an employee to \u201ccome out from behind the counter to fight her,\u201d the document said.\nTavarus Ross also allegedly threw a glass cookie display at one of the employees, who deflected it with his hand before it shattered on the floor, the affidavit said.\nBurger King staff called the police to report the attack.\nWhen police arrived, the three had already fled. Displays were on the floor and staff was cleaning up spilled liquid around the counter, the affidavit said. An employee who reported the incident told police about what allegedly set off Sheree Ross.\nPolice caught Sheree Ross after an employee gave police her license plate number.\nAfter being pulled over, the suspect allegedly told police she knew she was in the wrong and was \u201cjust heated in the moment.\u201d\nShe also identified her husband, who was arrested at his job \u2014 at another fast-food restaurant, the affidavit said.\nTavarus Ross allegedly told investigators he only pushed the cookie display off the counter but did not throw it. He also said he was upset because his wife told him Burger King employees threw soda on his child.\nHe allegedly said he tried to call the police and listed some phone numbers that he had dialed, but Maricopa dispatchers received no call from him, the affidavit said.\nSheree and Tavarus Ross were booked into the Pinal County Jail. They face charges of causing damage and a disturbance. She was released on her own recognizance. He posted $1,000 bond and was released, according to the Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nIt was unclear whether they have attorneys.

But he said the coupons came off and I said, \u2018No, the coupons are not off.\u2019\u201d\nJohnson said the cashier grabbed his calculator. She said she also added up the groceries again.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018What the F do you want my job?\u2019 And I was in a state of shock,\u201d Johnson said.\nHowever, Johnson said the employee did not stop there.\n\u201cThe stuff was on the conveyor belt, and he got the chips, and he took both of his fists and slammed them so hard that the chips went everywhere,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe then grabbed the bag, and he was shaking the bag with chips going all over me. He then threw them from the register across the floor.\u201d\nOther employees ended up sweeping up the mess. But Johnson said she feared for her life during the incident.\n\u201cI saw the chicken wings and I picked them up and I threw them and hit him. He looked at me and got to screaming,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe shopper said the employee in question had to be restrained.\nPolice described the male worker as being in his 40s. They have not yet charged the employee, but a report indicated a charge is pending for disorderly conduct.\nKroger representatives said they are aware of the customer\u2019s concern and are currently reviewing the situation.\nCopyright 2023 WTVG via Gray Media Group, Inc.

With two locations in Heath and Newark on the outskirts of Columbus, the brand is expanding with as many as six new units by the end of 2023.\n\u201cPlaza Pizza has been a staple in these communities for more than 50 years and has some fiercely loyal customers,\u201d says co-owner Brian Claggett. He added that he grew up eating Plaza Pizza and was stationed in the military in Korea when his mother called to let him know Plaza was for sale. After doing some research and due diligence, Claggett and his two siblings, Ben and Olivia, bought Plaza\u2019s Newark location in 2019. He said the establishment has changed tremendously since it first opened in the seventies.\n\u201cIt was a beloved, old school mom and pop business that only accepted cash or checks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it withstood the test of time because customers loved the quality and the authentic flavors and ingredients.\u201d\nClaggett has not tinkered with the original menu very much and is still serving up popular pizzas such as All the Meats, which includes pepperoni, bacon, ham, sausage, and hamburger, and All the Way, which has pepperoni, mushroom, onion, green pepper, green olives, and banana peppers. A Cauliflower Crust is preferred by customers following keto or low carb diets, while toasted subs called Torpedoes are piled high with toppings. Unlike some pizza chains that rely on frozen crusts and toppings, Claggett says Plaza\u2019s dough and sauce is made in-house every day and produce is noticeably fresh from supporting local farmers. Claggett added that Plaza\u2019s success with two locations in the Columbus area is an indicator the brand will do well in other parts of the country.\n\u201cColumbus is a melting pot of diverse palates and preferences due in part to the influence of Ohio State,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with numerous industry experts who confirm that if a food concept can be successful in Columbus, it can be successful throughout America.\u201d\nPlaza Pizza is actively seeking entrepreneurs and investors to become franchise partners. Startup costs are attractive compared to similar options, as Plaza is a pickup franchise without the burgeoning overheads of dine-in restaurants There is a franchise fee of $45,000 with a special military discount extended to veterans. Claggett says franchisees will benefit from the knowledge, support, and resources of the corporate team, and will learn everything they need to know about running a successful business.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible profits from our locations, so we have the playbook on how to succeed,\u201d he says. \u201cIn addition to our efficient operations, I believe we\u2019ve been successful because we are focused on doing one thing well \u2013 and that\u2019s thin crust pizza. We are not trying to become a jack-of-all trades, and would rather be known as the premier thin crust brand in America.\u201d\n3. source quality: poor\ntitle: Domino's Pizza\nrating: 4\ncategory:\n- Pizza delivery\n- Chicken wings restaurant\n- Pizza restaurant\n- Pizza Takeout\nabout: Delivery/carryout chain offering a wide range of pizzas & a variety of other dishes & sides.\naddress: 1226 N 21st St, Newark, OH 43055\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Friday 10:30\u202fAM\u20131:30\u202fAM\n- Saturday 10:30\u202fAM\u20131:30\u202fAM\n- Sunday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Monday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Tuesday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n- Wednesday 10:30\u202fAM\u201312:30\u202fAM\n\n4. source quality: poor\ntitle: Christy\u2019s Pizza\nrating: 4.3\ncategory:\n- Pizza restaurant\n- Delivery Restaurant\nabout: Veteran pizza parlor providing various pies, subs & salads in a spacious, laid-back setting.\naddress: 15 E Church St, Newark, OH 43055\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n- Friday 11\u202fAM\u201311\u202fPM\n- Saturday 5\u201311\u202fPM\n- Sunday Closed\n- Monday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n- Tuesday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n- Wednesday 11\u202fAM\u201310\u202fPM\n\n5. source quality: poor\ntitle: flaming grill Newark, NJ 07191: Wawa\nname: Wawa\nnum_reviews: '65'\nrating: '3.4'\ncategories:\n- Gas Stations\n- Convenience Stores\n- Fast Food\ntop_categories:\n- Automotive\n- Restaurants\n- Food\nprice_level: 1\nfull_address: 200 Harrison Ave Kearny, NJ\namenities:\n- Offers Delivery\n- Offers Takeout\n- Accepts Credit Cards\n- Private Lot Parking\n- Free Wi-Fi\n- Offers Delivery\n- Offers Takeout\n- Accepts Credit Cards\n- Private Lot Parking\n- Free Wi-Fi\nzipcode: '07032'\nestablish_year: '1803'\nhours:\n  Mon: Open 24 hours\n  Tue: Open 24 hours\n  Wed: Open 24 hours\n  Thu: Open 24 hours\n  Fri: Open 24 hours\n  Sat: Open 24 hours\n  Sun: Open 24 hours\ntelephone: (201) 991-4091\nhistory: Wawa, founded in 1803, is headquartered in Wawa, Pennsylvania.

If you consider yourself to be true and tried carnivore, you'll love the endless array of quality cuts that Japanese BBQ and steakhouses offer. While some establishments allow you to have a more interactive yakiniku experience while you grill your own meats, more high-end Japanese steakhouses prepare everything for you, and sometimes, in front of you.\nWhether you're visiting or a local, Los Angeles is home to several different kinds of Japanese steakhouses including fine-dining, Michelin-starred options along with more casual, chain restaurants. From A5 wagyu to tender filet mignon, many of these steakhouses serve the best of the best when it comes to beef. While you'll definitely need to make a reservation for the more upscale spots, many of these classic and casual joints can be dined at on a whim. That said, get ready to grill because we've ranked the 15 best Japanese steakhouses in LA!\n15. Gyu-Kaku\nIf you're new to Japanese BBQ, Gyu-Kaku is a solid place to start. You definitely won't get the highest-quality cuts, but the experience is fun, consistent, flavorful, and filling. There are locations all throughout Los Angeles stretching from Santa Monica to Pasadena with several in between. Availability varies between locations, but most Gyu-Kaku's offer an all-you-can-eat option for those that are extra hungry.\nThat said, the a la carte menu is most popular for patrons looking to choose all of their own meats and appetizers. Start off with the light and spicy cucumber salad before digging into the hearty selection of meats. When it's time to get grilling, explore different cuts like the popular prime Kalbi short rib or beef tongue. If you visit during happy hour, meats like the filet mignon and premium sirloin can be ordered at a discounted price. Gyu-Kaku also has a few poultry and pork options to choose from as well.\n14. Habachiana Grill\nLooking to enjoy some teriyaki steak on the go? Located in downtown Los Angeles, Habachiana Grill is a fast-casual spot that is ideal for takeout. From rice bowls to combo plates, the food is simple yet tasty. All Habachihana entrees and combo plates are served with grilled veggies and steamed rice, but you can always upgrade to fried rice (and it's well worth it). When it comes to the Habachihana entrees, the New York steak and filet mignon are top contenders for carnivores, but you can also choose between shrimp, salmon, chicken, and more.\nThat said, if you love steak and seafood, the combo plates are where it's at. Enjoy a mix of lobster, filet mignon, and shrimp for some surf and turf, or get your protein fix with filet and chicken. There are also five different sauces to choose from such as diablo sauce, garlic butter, and yum yum teriyaki.\n13. Shogun\nWith eight different locations in Southern California, Shogun is a local favorite that serves up some of the best teppan steak and sushi. The Los Angeles location is in Pasadena, but even if you live on the other side of the city, it's well worth the drive across town. While you can always try walking in, reservations are definitely recommended, so do your best to plan ahead before visiting. Start off with a refreshing and smooth sake or opt for the sake sampler to get a true taste of what Shogun's selection has to offer.\nShogun also has a variety of signature cocktails, many of which are on the sweeter side. When it comes to food, there are tons of sushi rolls to choose from if you want to kick off your meal with a lighter bite. However, once it's time for steak, the filet mignon sumo cut is a must-order.\n12. RedRock\nLocated in Torrance, RedRock is a strip mall eatery that serves American beef in a very relaxed and laid-back atmosphere. Despite the very casual counter-ordering service and simple interior, the food at RedRock is consistently impressive. That said, the most popular and iconic dish at RedRock is without a doubt the s\n2. source quality: poor\ntitle: All You Can Eat Sushi Buffet Los Angeles, CA: Roll Call - Koreatown\nname: Roll Call - Koreatown\nnum_reviews: 562\nrating: 4.3\ncategories:\n- Sushi Bars\n- Japanese\ntop_categories:\n- Restaurants\nprice_level: 2\nfull_address: '3183 Wilshire Blvd\nSte 186 Los Angeles, CA'\namenities:\n- Offers Takeout\n- Proof of vaccination required\n- Masks required\n- Staff wears masks\n- Vegan Options\n- Limited Vegetarian Options\n- Accepts Credit Cards\n- Outdoor Seating\n- Trendy, Casual\n- Moderate Noise\n- Casual Dress\n- Offers Catering\n- Good for Groups\n- Good For Kids\n- Good for Lunch, Dinner\n- Garage Parking, Validated Parking\n- Happy Hour Specials\n- Beer &amp; Wine Only\n- TV\n- Gender-neutral restrooms\n- Asian-owned\n- Women-owned\n- Offers Military Discount\n- Covered Outdoor Seating\n- Bike Parking\npopular_dishes:\n- name: Bento Box\n- name: Spicy Tuna Roll\n- name: Salmon Double Trouble Roll\n- name: California Roll\n- name: Crispy Rice Tuna\nzipcode: '90010'\nhours:\nMon: 11:00 AM - 8:45 PM\nTue: 11:00 AM - 8:45 PM\nWed: 11:00 AM - 8:45 PM\nThu: 11:00 AM - 8:45 PM\nFri: 11:00 AM - 8:45 PM\nSat: 11:00 AM - 8:45 PM\nSun: 11:00 AM - 8:45 PM\ntelephone: (213) 908-5091\nspecialties: Get SUSHI delivered from our Yelp page!\nprice_range: $11-30\n3. source quality: poor\ntitle: All You Can Eat Sushi & BBQ\nrating: 4.2\ncategory:\n- Japanese restaurant\n- Korean barbecue restaurant\nabout: Casual eatery with rear parking specializing in cook-your-own, Korean-style BBQ & spicy sides.\naddress: 3914 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90010\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 5 PM\u201312 AM\n- Friday 3 PM\u201312 AM\n- Saturday 3 PM\u201312 AM\n- Sunday 3 PM\u201312 AM\n- Monday Closed\n- Tuesday 5 PM\u201312 AM\n- Wednesday 5 PM\u201312 AM\n4. source quality: poor\ntitle: Sushi Ippo\nrating: 4.1\ncategory:\n- Sushi restaurant\n- Restaurant\nabout: Informal sushi bar with a la carte rolls & a popular all-you-can-eat option, plus beer & soju.\naddress: '3800 Wilshire Blvd #110, Los Angeles, CA 90010'\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 11:30 AM\u201311 PM\n- Friday 11:30 AM\u201312 AM\n- Saturday 11:30 AM\u201312 AM\n- Sunday 12\u201311 PM\n- Monday 11:30 AM\u201311 PM\n- Tuesday 11:30 AM\u201311 PM\n- Wednesday 11:30 AM\u201311 PM\n5. source quality: poor\ntitle: Hello Fish Sushi & Izakaya\nrating: 4.3\ncategory:\n- Sushi restaurant\naddress: 414 S Western Ave B, Los Angeles, CA 90020\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 5 PM\u20132 AM\n- Friday 12 PM\u20132 AM\n- Saturday 12 PM\u20132 AM\n- Sunday 12 PM\u20132 AM\n- Monday 5 PM\u20132 AM\n- Tuesday 5 PM\u20132 AM\n- Wednesday 5 PM\u20132 AM\n6. source quality: poor\ntitle: The Sushi by Jin\nrating: 4.5\ncategory:\n- Sushi restaurant\n- Japanese restaurant\nabout: Straightforward operation popular for all-you-can-eat portions of creative sushi rolls.\naddress: 6010 Laurel Canyon Blvd, Valley Glen, CA 91606\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 12\u20132:30 PM 4:30\u20139 PM\n- Friday 12\u20132:30 PM 4:30\u20139 PM\n- Saturday 12\u20139 PM\n- Sunday 2\u20138 PM\n- Monday 12\u20132:30 PM 4:30\u20139 PM\n- Tuesday 12\u20132:30 PM 4:30\u20139 PM\n- Wednesday 12\u20132:30 PM 4:30\u20139 PM\n7. source quality: poor\ntitle: Kura Revolving Sushi Bar\nrating: 4.5\ncategory:\n- Conveyor belt sushi restaurant\n- Asian restaurant\n- Japanese restaurant\n- Restaurant\n- Sushi restaurant\nabout: An array of sushi & other Japanese dishes drifts past diners on a conveyor belt at this simple spot.\naddress: 333 E 2nd St, Los Angeles, CA 90012\nopen_hours:\n- Thursday 11 AM\u201310:30 PM\n- Friday 11 AM\u201311 PM\n- Saturday 11 AM\u201311 PM\n- Sunday 11 AM\u201310:30 PM\n- Monday 11 AM\u201310:30 PM\n- Tuesday 11 AM\u201310:30 PM\n- Wednesday 11 AM\u201310:30 PM\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

The Brazilian dog groomer banks $1.3 million a year providing canines with impeccable coifs in California. But what you may not know is that Feitosa is lending his services, free of charge, to shelter pups looking for forever homes. In a new collab with the San Diego Humane Society, Feitosa is beautifying fur babies eligible for adoption.\nDog grooming star helps shelter dogs\nAccording to KPBS , Feitosa has teamed up with the San Diego Humane Society to offer grooming for its tough-to-place pooches. The shelter is overrun with more dogs than they can care for. Currently, they house more than 1,100 dogs across multiple campuses. That puts them at 170% of capacity.\nSo, last December, Feitosa contacted the organization to see how he could help the dogs they serve.\n\u201cI was trying to find a way to give back,\u201d Feitosa told KPBS. \u201cSo I reached out to the Humane Society and said, \u2018Hey guys, what if we transform your guys\u2019s dogs and bring attention not only for the dogs who are (not) getting to get adopted right away, but to the cause?'\u201d\nIt was an offer the humane society couldn\u2019t refuse.\nMore than a makeover\nFeitosa focuses on dogs that often get overlooked, like senior dogs and large-breed dogs . Among his clients on a recent trip to the humane society\u2019s El Cajon campus was a three-legged dog named Minnow. Feitosa turned the tiny canine into a tiger with strategically-placed dye (which was vegan and non-toxic).\nA much bigger dog named Nyla also got a makeover. The fluffy white pup received rainbow hues on her ears and tail.\nAfter the dogs get dyed, they receive a bath, blow dry, and a trim. Then they\u2019re ready for their close-up \u2013 on Feitosa\u2019s wildly popular TikTok and Instagram channels.\nAs if these random acts of kindness weren\u2019t enough, Feitosa also pays for the adoption fees and any other costs his special clients incur at the shelter.\n\u201cIt fills me with joy, especially because we focus on transforming the dogs that actually need more attention,\u201d he told KPBS. \u201cWhen I hear that those guys get adopted, I\u2019m just like over the moon. I\u2019m just grateful that I get to do it.\u201d\nThe post Dog Grooming Star Donates Services to San Diego Humane Society appeared first on DogTime .\n2. source quality: google\nHighlighted Answer from Google: PetSmart\nSan Diego (Sports Arena) - PetSmart\n\n3. source quality: poor\ntitle: pet smart grooming Sports Arena Blvd, San Diego, CA 92110: PetSmart\nname: PetSmart\nnum_reviews: 176\nrating: 3.5\ncategories:\n- Pet Stores\n- Pet Training\n- Pet Groomers\ntop_categories:\n- Pets\nfull_address: 3610 Rosecrans St San Diego, CA\nzipcode: '92110'\nestablish_year: '1987'\nhours:\n  Mon: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Tue: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Wed: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Thu: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Fri: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Sat: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM\n  Sun: 10:00 AM - 7:00 PM\ntelephone: (619) 523-4177\nhistory: We have more than 1,600 pet stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, over 200 in-store PetSmart's PetsHotels, dog and cat boarding facilities, and employ approximately 55,000 associates across our company.

It can be hard to find a minute of peace \u2013 from white noise of the \u201cL\u201d train to the eerie whistling of harsh wind through tiny gaps in the windows. From the paralyzingly cold winters to the drenchingly humid summers, it\u2019s rare to find a climate that allows for moments of pure appreciation for the city. While sometimes overwhelming, Chicago is nonetheless a city full of rich history and artistic passion. Even in the cruelest of Chicago days, there is beauty to be found in the mere details of the architecture and the remnants of historic artistic expression. The surviving bookstores of Chicago stand as examples of this phenomenon. The necessity of physical bookstores dwindles, but the persistence of the certain stores still standing is proof of the community\u2019s appreciation for tangible literature.\nFor the book lover new to Chicago, you may be pleased to hear that there is a thriving community of bookstores and booksellers in the city, and it won\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon.\nIn efforts to keep the community alive, the organization Chicago Loves Books challenges book lovers to an annual bookstore crawl in honor of Independent Bookstore Day. This past April, the third annual crawl ranged across \u201cmore than 40 independent bookstores in the greater Chicago area\u2014from Lake Forest to Beverly, and Naperville to the Loop.\u201d\nI discovered this challenge during a visit to the independent bookstore closest to my apartment: Sandmeyer\u2019s Bookstore. I was thrilled to find out that bookstores still had the potential to stir up so much hype through an event like this.\nFor anyone like myself who is interested in participating in the book crawl but find themselves limited to transportation via the \u201cL,\u201d here are my favorites. These essential stops for bookstore connoisseurs are all located less than a ten minute walk from Red or Blue Line stations. While all beautiful, they each have unique personalities that are appreciated best by different types of visitors.\nSandmeyer\u2019s Bookstore: For the old timey-loving reader\nThe first time I stepped foot into this bookstore, my senses were flooded by the smell of hardwood and sound of the creaky floors I walked on. Stepping in from the harsh Chicago weather, the space feels untouched not only by the weather outside but by time itself. The ambience is createdbrought by nothing more than the noticeable age of the building, untouched by any sort of remodel, only restoration.\nRight off of the Harrison Red Line stop, this store is located in the heart of Printer\u2019s Row in the South Loop, a place oozing with history that is especially relevant to the creation of books themselves. This site was once the epicenter for printing and bookbinding in the midwest as of the late 19th-century. Despite the store\u2019s time capsule-like aesthetic, their selection is constantly up-to-date on new releases and best sellers. They have a wide variety of well-organized genres, offering something for everyone.\nQuimby\u2019s Bookstore: For the graphic novel and zine lover\nI first found myself in Quimby\u2019s Bookstore on the day of last year\u2019s crawl. In true Chicago fashion, I stumbled in from a flash April shower to the comfort of a roof over my head and the warm embrace of a bookstore. Opposing the concept of a traditional bookstore, Quimby\u2019s embraces an angsty vibe through its obsc\n\nWhen you respond, follow the following rules:\n1.

Will my students' parents put the blame on me for poor grades? Will they question my instructional methods? Will anyone even show up?\nIn the 22 years I've been teaching, I've seen just about everything. I've had a parent ask me\nwhy I teach\nMacbeth\nwhen everyone knows Shakespeare is boring and antiquated. I've had to explain to a parent that her child was on her phone way too much in class while the parent obsessively texted on her own phone during our entire conversation. I've had parents tell me I shouldn't care about plagiarism\u2014I should just be happy their child found the information at all.\nDespite these occasional moments of friction, teachers should do their utmost to see parents as essential partners in their students' education. After all, have you ever met any parents who didn't want their child to succeed? Parents can be valuable allies in helping students achieve their best, and meetings are a great way to forge those bonds. Here are eight tips to help you conduct masterful, action-oriented parent-teacher meetings.\nBe Proactive\nDon't forget to factor in some students' ninja-like ability to ensure their parents don't know conference times and dates; the same student who may have trouble on his math exams may be secretly adept at hacking into his dad's smartphone and deleting a voicemail. Repeated communication is occasionally necessary.\nSometimes, it can be difficult to even get parents into the building: work runs late, coordinating childcare is a headache, and language barriers may hinder communication. You can overcome some of these obstacles by finding culturally appropriate ways to welcome families and encourage them to become active participants in your classroom. Send invitations in a parent's native language, or have translators on hand. At my school, designated students handle basic translation of nonconfidential conversations, while school translators handle more delicate issues. If childcare is a problem, let parents know they can bring young ones to the meeting.\nBe Welcoming\nSet the right tone for your parent-teacher meeting by shaking hands, stating your name and the subject you teach, and mentioning how happy you are to be teaching their child. Smile warmly, and offer them a seat. If you're looking for an easy way to break the ice, share a positive anecdote about their child. For example, \"Did Jeremiah tell you he was the first one to solve the difficult math problem yesterday?\"\nExplain Objectives and Expectations\nI like to give parents an overview of the goals for my classes and a copy of our reading list. I discuss the expectations I have for my students and explain any language that a parent might not be familiar with: rubric, scaffolding, readiness, testing acronyms, etc. In addition, I provide parents with a copy of my classroom policies to review and sign, which helps avoid any confusion in the future.\nBe Prepared\nParents want to see that the teacher knows their child and has a plan for their success. Review your students' grades and portfolios before the conferences. Jot down notes about each student, anticipate questions or parental concerns, and reread any prior parent communication so you don't miss a beat.\nCreate an Action Plan\nParents don't want a laundry list of concerns dumped in their laps\u2014they want to know how you're going to fix the problem. Create an action plan that clearly lays out the specific steps that the teacher, the parent, and the student will need to take in order for the student to be successful. For instance, if Gabriela doesn't complete essays because she has a difficult time writing introductions, her written action plan should include an agreement that she'll notify you when she needs help, that you'll meet with her to provide assistance, and that her parents will make sure that she spends time at home crafting her essay.\nUse the Good-Bad-Good Sandwich\nWhen it comes to discussing tough topics with a parent, this trick is the silver bullet. Start by highlighting something positive\u2014\"Gerald's writing shows an insight I don't often see in students his age\"\u2014then move on to the issue: \"The problem is that Gerald is often off-task, and I've caught him on his phone several times. When he's not paying attention, he misses valuable class content.\" Discuss your action plan for correcting the behavior, and finish up with another positive statement: \"With Gerald's strong writing ability and his improved attention in class, I know he'll have a successful year.\" The good-bad-good sandwich is practically foolproof.\nDon't Tolerate Abuse\nI've had parents threaten to call the superintendent, the mayor, the pope (OK, maybe not the pope, but you get the idea). If a parent becomes abusive, simply end the meeting; explain how they can take up the matter with the principal. There's no reason you have to let a parent bully or intimidate you.\nKeep Lines of Communication Open\nExplain to parents how they can get in touch with you after the meeting, and ask the best way to reach them. Encourage them to ask questions, provide updates, and express concerns as they see fit.\nBumps in the road happen, but 98 percent of my parent-teacher meetings over the years have been meaningful and effective. Some of my students' parents have even become strong advocates for my classroom. And many have truly gone the extra mile for teachers.\nFor instance, for three years while her child was in my class, one parent made sure to bring me a home-cooked Italian dinner before every single parent-teacher conference. By graduation, I felt like I needed to give that parent my Social Security number so she could put me down as a dependent on her income tax\u2014boy, I sure miss all that pasta e fagioli and lasagna.\nParents and teachers are on the same team when it comes to helping students achieve. Following these steps can help you create partnerships with parents and ensure that all your students are equipped to succeed.\nSHARE\nFOLLOW\nBeyond the\nclassroom\nProfessional\ndevelopment\nTeaching\nmoments\nClassroom\ninnovation\nRecommended\nHow to Build Trust with Students\nLearn more \u203a\nEngaging Students during the Long Winter Months\nLearn more \u203a\n5 REALISTIC Ways for Teachers to Get Healthier This Year\nLearn more \u203a\nRelated\nNancy Barile\nAward-Winning Teacher\nM.A.Ed.\nNancy Barile is a National Board Certified Teacher, who has been teaching English Language Arts at a low-income, urban high school near Boston, MA for 22 years.

If your heart is really set on going to a cheap buffet the closest one to the Palazzo is probably the buffet at Circus Circus (I\u2019ll have some of the yella and don\u2019t get cheap on me). If your heart is really set on going to a good buffet the closest one is at the Wynn but expect to pay around $75 per person. One option might be to go to Galpo Gaucho for lunch.

[INST] Much like New York, the city is a 24-hour town that is always buzzing with activity, either on the Las Vegas Strip or downtown. Whether it's food, gambling, or toiletries, you can find it all on the Strip, and with everything always available, visitors can keep the party going until morning. [INST] In other news, water is wet. [INST] Las Vegas is known for its vibrant nightlife, entertainment, and glitz, making it one of the most visited cities in the world. If you're looking to host guests on Airbnb, Las Vegas is a fantastic destination to get started. The city has plenty of unique neighborhoods, each offering a different experience for tourists. [INST] A good, cheap buffet in Las Vegas is really an oxymoron. There aren\u2019t that many buffets still operating now and outside of a select few, most cater to a more upscale crowd who don\u2019t mind paying $65-$80 per person. If your heart is really set on going to a cheap buffet the closest one to the Palazzo is probably the buffet at Circus Circus (I\u2019ll have some of the yella and don\u2019t get cheap on me). If your heart is really set on going to a good buffet the closest one is at the Wynn but expect to pay around $75 per person. One option might be to go to Galpo Gaucho for lunch. It\u2019s the Brazilian steakhouse in the Fashion Show Mall. While it is not a buffet in the tradtional sense, it is all you can eat with a nice salad and sides station and unlimited \u201cmeat\u201d In fact you\u2019ll definitely get the meat sweats. A little under $50 per person for lunch. It\u2019s been rumored that Groupon sometimes has specials. [INST] In this article , we 're exploring five exceptional hotels in Las Vegas .

Recently I went to Brooklyn for a business trip and explored many restaurants for a good afternoon meal. Although I like almost every restaurant there, these three took a special place in my heart. \nColonie- If you want to enjoy fresh, locally sourced american cuisine in a relaxed and inviting setting, then yes, this restaurant is for you. The lunch here was out of this world. I ordered fajitas and Twinkies with a blood orange margarita. Both were amazing, fresh, seasonal and very creative. I absolutely loved it. Moreover, the staff was friendly, knowledgeable and equally gave importance to hygiene also. If I were to rate this restaurant, I would give it 9. 5 out of 10. \nNota Bene- I specially went there to eat pizza but stayed for their bread. Remarkably crispy and flavourful, I also ordered Chakapuli, not knowing what it was and was pleasantly surprised. Loved the interior of the restaurant. It has so much character. The staff were lovely. In fact, I got a chat with the owner, a super genuine guy. This place is my new favorite because I got everything I expected from a restaurant: ambience, prices, hygiene, music, and, most importantly, food. I would give it 9. 3 out of 10. \nOlmsted- I went there with my two friends, and it was a wonderful experience. The food was high quality. Although the portions were small for such a creative menu and fun experience, I did say it was worth it. We ordered soup and carrot cake, which became our favorite after that. They also serve complimentary mocktails and cocktails. The staff was superb, and even the servers were also lovely. My overall experience in this restaurant was fabulous. I would give it 9 out of 10.

Star Tavern. (252) [INST] Being a food lover, I am always on the hunt for good eating spots anytime I travel somewhere new. Recently I went to Brooklyn for a business trip and explored many restaurants for a good afternoon meal. Although I like almost every restaurant there, these three took a special place in my heart. \nColonie- If you want to enjoy fresh, locally sourced american cuisine in a relaxed and inviting setting, then yes, this restaurant is for you. The lunch here was out of this world. I ordered fajitas and Twinkies with a blood orange margarita. Both were amazing, fresh, seasonal and very creative. I absolutely loved it. Moreover, the staff was friendly, knowledgeable and equally gave importance to hygiene also. If I were to rate this restaurant, I would give it 9. 5 out of 10. \nNota Bene- I specially went there to eat pizza but stayed for their bread. Remarkably crispy and flavourful, I also ordered Chakapuli, not knowing what it was and was pleasantly surprised. Loved the interior of the restaurant. It has so much character. The staff were lovely. In fact, I got a chat with the owner, a super genuine guy. This place is my new favorite because I got everything I expected from a restaurant: ambience, prices, hygiene, music, and, most importantly, food. I would give it 9. 3 out of 10. \nOlmsted- I went there with my two friends, and it was a wonderful experience. The food was high quality. Although the portions were small for such a creative menu and fun experience, I did say it was worth it. We ordered soup and carrot cake, which became our favorite after that. They also serve complimentary mocktails and cocktails. The staff was superb, and even the servers were also lovely. My overall experience in this restaurant was fabulous. I would give it 9 out of 10.

It was an amazing trip as we explored many places such as the Brooklyn Museum, New York Transit Museum, Dyker Heights, Williamsburg and many more.

Even though I like every restaurant there, I would still like to suggest the five best French restaurants in Brooklyn.

Some of the best areas to stay in Miami for couples are South Beach, Miami Beach, Brickell, Coconut Grove, Bal Harbour, Coral Gables, Wynwood, and Key Biscayne. [INST] MIA is about 2 miles directly north of Coral Gables. I guarantee you will enjoy your two days there, where you\u2019ll be able to spend time at Vooks & Books, Giralda Plaza, almost every variety of restaurant and amazing architecture. If you need to do any shopping, Merrick Park is located on Ponce de Leon & US1. Also recommended, if the weather cooperates - a day pass at The Biltmore. \nOtherwise, there\u2019s an old movie theater just south of the airport, LeJeune Cinemas, on LeJeune Road. Not the nicest, newest cinema, but the movies (new releases) are cheap and it won\u2019t take longer than 5 minutes to get there.

The crime rate is low, and if visitors ever experience crime, it is usually petty in nature. [INST] The Hawaiian capital serves as the hub of Hawaii's nightlife and never fails to entertain visitors. Drinks, karaoke, dancing and even music, the city of Honolulu offers great nightly entertainment, from live music in small local bars and beach huts to upscale clubs with karaoke nights and jazz musicals. [INST] Beaches: The North Shore and the east side have the most beautiful beaches, and usually the least crowded. Famous Waikiki is a great beach, but it's often so crowded it's hard to walk around. Waikiki has great surfing, and lovely views of Diamond Head. If you're a beach bum you won't be disappointed on Oahu. [INST] The best neighborhoods for beach vacations are Waikiki, Ala Moana, Diamond Head, and Kahala. Waikiki offers the busiest beaches with the most services, dining, surfboard rentals and lessons, and water sports centers. [INST] With over 300,000 residents, Honolulu is the most populous Oceanian city outside Australasia. Honolulu's favorable tropical climate, rich natural scenery, and extensive beaches make it a popular global destination for tourists. [INST] The state's capital city, Honolulu, showcases the island's urban appeal. Nearby you'll find a host of cultural and historic sites, from the ornate Iolani Palace to the austere USS Arizona Memorial at the Pearl Harbor National Memorial. [INST] Yanagi sushi is my go to for late night eats although I would say expect a wait. Carp Dori Yakitori is good too (Japanese baseball themed). Fujiyama texas would be another late night option; never been there but heard good things. \n\n Not sure how old you are, but Dave &amp; Busters is fun. Wednesdays is club night and I have stayed till 2 am. Games are half off from 10pm-2am. They make all the kids leave by 10 pm. You don't have to dance on the 2nd level, just play games on the 3rd level. Dave &amp; busters is right to the movie theater as well. Ichiriki Japanese Nabe (Japanese hotpot) is good, open till 10:30 pm on weekends. \n\nDepending on when you're coming, might be a good show at the Republik or HB Social Club. Console VGM is a videogame music cover band that plays at Anna O'Brien's. Check their social media page if that piques your interest. \n\nI like walking around the boardwalk in Waikiki at night, very chill. If you're going to be here for the first Friday of the month, I'd recommend checking out HiSam (Hawaii state art museum). They'll have a show or performance of some sort that Friday night. Maybe another event on the 2nd Friday of the month. \n\n Just throwing out some additional late night options. If you like Karaoke &amp; gay bars: In between and Wang Chung's. If you or your wife likes drag shows, check out Scarlet in Chinatown. \n\nHopefully this gives you some ideas.

The crime rate is low, and if visitors ever experience crime, it is usually petty in nature. [INST] The Hawaiian capital serves as the hub of Hawaii's nightlife and never fails to entertain visitors. Drinks, karaoke, dancing and even music, the city of Honolulu offers great nightly entertainment, from live music in small local bars and beach huts to upscale clubs with karaoke nights and jazz musicals. [INST] Beaches: The North Shore and the east side have the most beautiful beaches, and usually the least crowded. Famous Waikiki is a great beach, but it's often so crowded it's hard to walk around. Waikiki has great surfing, and lovely views of Diamond Head. If you're a beach bum you won't be disappointed on Oahu. [INST] The best neighborhoods for beach vacations are Waikiki, Ala Moana, Diamond Head, and Kahala. Waikiki offers the busiest beaches with the most services, dining, surfboard rentals and lessons, and water sports centers. [INST] With over 300,000 residents, Honolulu is the most populous Oceanian city outside Australasia. Honolulu's favorable tropical climate, rich natural scenery, and extensive beaches make it a popular global destination for tourists. [INST] The state's capital city, Honolulu, showcases the island's urban appeal. Nearby you'll find a host of cultural and historic sites, from the ornate Iolani Palace to the austere USS Arizona Memorial at the Pearl Harbor National Memorial. [INST] Yanagi sushi is my go to for late night eats although I would say expect a wait. Carp Dori Yakitori is good too (Japanese baseball themed). Fujiyama texas would be another late night option; never been there but heard good things. \n\n Not sure how old you are, but Dave &amp; Busters is fun. Wednesdays is club night and I have stayed till 2 am. Games are half off from 10pm-2am. They make all the kids leave by 10 pm. You don't have to dance on the 2nd level, just play games on the 3rd level. Dave &amp; busters is right to the movie theater as well. Ichiriki Japanese Nabe (Japanese hotpot) is good, open till 10:30 pm on weekends. \n\nDepending on when you're coming, might be a good show at the Republik or HB Social Club. Console VGM is a videogame music cover band that plays at Anna O'Brien's. Check their social media page if that piques your interest. \n\nI like walking around the boardwalk in Waikiki at night, very chill. If you're going to be here for the first Friday of the month, I'd recommend checking out HiSam (Hawaii state art museum). They'll have a show or performance of some sort that Friday night. Maybe another event on the 2nd Friday of the month. \n\n Just throwing out some additional late night options. If you like Karaoke &amp; gay bars: In between and Wang Chung's. If you or your wife likes drag shows, check out Scarlet in Chinatown. \n\nHopefully this gives you some ideas. [INST] Although the following figures are average estimates on what you might spend on necessities and fun in Hawaii, they may help you when planning your vacation budget: Breakfast and lunch: $8 to $16 per person. Dinner: $14 to $25 per person. Gourmet meal: $25 to $55 per person.
