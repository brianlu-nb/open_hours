For example, if a body was left to decompose until it reached the liquefaction stage, the flooring beneath the body would have absorbed liquids from the decomposing body and may need to be replaced.\n\n5. **Personal Protective Equipment**: Crime scene cleaners wear thickly lined bodysuits with long sleeves and hoods, booties over their shoes, heavy-duty respirators with HEPA filters, and often eye protection to shield them from any dangerous or unpleasant particles.\n\n6. **Removal of Odors**: Depending on how long a body has been left to decompose, the odors alone can be overpowering without protection. Therefore, crime scene cleaners may need to use specific techniques and equipment to handle the smells associated with decomposing bodies.\n\nRemember, trying to clean up evidence of a crime without proper training and equipment can be difficult and could potentially compromise the integrity of the crime scene investigation.

Train your dog to go to the bathroom in a designated area. You can use gravel or paving to discourage your dog from going on the grass. \n2. Raise your lawn mower mowing height slightly, making the grass less sensitive and quicker to recover from damage.\n3. Use water to dilute the nitrogen and salts from the dog urine and wash them away. This can be done by following your dog around the garden when they go for a wee and immediately pouring water over the offending area.\n4. Use a product specifically designed to prevent dogs from eating grass. Some companies offer granules or sprays that repel dogs from grass.\n5. Try to change your dog's behavior by offering them other options for entertainment and exercise. Dogs often turn to grass eating when they're bored or lack stimulation.\n\nRegarding dogs consuming their own or another animal's feces, it is unclear why they do this. Some theories suggest that dogs may consume grass to increase fiber intake, to help purge their intestines of parasites, or due to curiosity. As for feces consumption, it is thought to stem from the animal\u2019s curiosity at a young age. Please consult with a veterinary professional for specific advice on your dog's habits. {\"sid\": \"\"}"]}], "tstamp": 1695849584.243236}

Symptoms of type 2 diabetes:\n   - Yeast infections: An increase in glucose can provide a hospitable environment for yeast growth, leading to infections in warm, moist areas of the body.\n   - Slow-healing sores or cuts: Nerve damage from high blood sugar can impair wound healing.\n   - Pain or numbness in feet or legs: Nerve damage can cause pain or numbness in extremities.\n\n3. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes:\n   - Unplanned weight loss: Without energy from food, your body will start breaking down muscles and fat for energy, leading to weight loss.\n   - Nausea and vomiting: When your body resorts to burning fat for energy, it produces ketones.
