"[Applause]  oh [Applause] ass it's cold I'm [Applause] here K welcome good morning yeah I got woken up at about 1:30 so hard it blew the tarp off my tent and everything's scattered everywhere man I was scared that a branch is going to fall on us or something can't really there in the street I was live last night for four hours you know actually do a different walk this time for once oh man it's cold I brought the umbrella so I can't really see it cuz it's so dark but yeah it is raining so oh man yeah woken up it was like 1:45 just could not go back to sleep so windy and the rain and it's just not [Applause] good six here with four legs nice there ain't many street lights down this street I'm walking on but oh Krabby what's up yeah bro it's 4:30 man I just said it I'll repeat again but I got woken up at like 1:30 by the wind blowing so hard it blew the tarp off my tent and the rain and I hear freaking the wind blowing we scared of the branch is going to fall on us or something cuz you know my tent's like under a tree so plus like a week ago you know it was really windy and there's like branches all over the ground you know trees falling and stuff so yeah that would suck hopefully it don't happen [Applause] though [Applause] man it's really starting to rain and sorry about the title guys that's not meant to be ebing W I don't know if you guys can see the rain but it is coming down I just I didn't even ask for help in like 10 days on This I Swear well I didn't I mean I didn't ask last night I said I could use the donation I said but I wasn't begging again I was just talking about that earlier though it's funny cuz like I swear like all the time people donate and stuff right and I don't really even need it that bad but then when you need it and you ask and you don't get it but dang it's really raining can you guys see that when the headlights drive by you can probably hear I'm sure good thing I got this umbrella or that suck [Applause] yep there's a branch right there on the street small one but still oh man nine here with six likes PDF what's up bro oh man oh man it's about to this wind's about to steal my umbrella oh no not good seven here with seven likes good luck 77 and today's 1111 so 15 days till my [Applause] birthday oh yeah I don't know if you guys can see the rain or not coming down pretty good and it's like 40\u00b0 out that makes it a lot worse too [Applause]  here's my shadow nine in the building with seven legs yeah that's coming down pretty good honestly can't see it on camera but you can definitely hear [Applause] it and it's so dark on the street you can't see much anyway but when the car headlights drive by you can see [Applause] it 10 here with Seven Lives [Applause] God [Applause] yeah it's a glitch man YouTube's been doing that for like the past week there's eight likes though it's not glitching on my side yeah it's it happens to a lot of people it's been happening for like maybe not quite a week but like four or five days at least people been talking about it happens in my streams it happens in other people's streams but pretty sure it's accurate on my end it says 11 here with eight likes but yeah it'll be like 1.2k likes or 12K likes or something crazy like that yeah I don't even get 200 views of videos so there definitely ain't 12K likes but yeah it's a glitch YouTube but kind of a cool glitch I guess makes it look like I actually have a lot of [Applause] viewers is that there's like a shirt in the a shirt on the ground that just walked over [Applause] interesting woohoo what's up welcome yeah so woohoo I guess the guy uh I mean it should still be going down like his you know I told you about his finger right his finger got infected and he almost had to lose his whole hand so yeah he's dealing with that obviously so I don't know how long it's going to be you know could be a couple months could be next year but if it still happens at all but we'll see I don't want to get my hopes up you know so hopefully though it happens eventually cuz it's getting way too cold out here I'll repeat this again for the fourth time but got woken up at 1:30 from the wind blowing so hard it like blew the tarp off my tent and it's raining too so it's just like yeah not good definitely not not feeling it today I can handle the rain or the cold but when you throw wind in there too it's just makes it a lot [Applause]  worse Mitch what's up welcome [Applause]  nine here with nine likes right on just walking just going for a walk yeah well the thing is the tarp isn't big enough to where I could use staks for it if I use staks then it's only going to go up like to the top of my tent it's not going to cover it so what I do is I throw it over the top and it kind of you know it hangs down but yeah oh man the wind hey Krabby I appreciate it bro thank you I could really need that right now plus you know my birthday is in like two weeks guys I know you know I'm going to be 34 I ain't a kid so I ain't expecting nothing for my birthday but if you do want to help you know it might be easier to help like now or maybe in a couple days or something cuz at the end of the month you know you're probably going to be having bills due and whatnot but don't worry about it just throwing that out there in case someone wants to help for my birthday but ain't a big deal like I said many times I ain't owed nothing or anything so so like oh yeah you should just donate right now you know cuz it's my birthday and yeah I'm a grown out adult but you know I'm just throwing it out there just in case I mean people donate anyway when it's not my birthday so figured I'd throw it out there oh man okay I'm probably just going to walk down to that light then turn around but it'll take me like 15 minutes to get back so what's this car doing here someone's in it smoking a cigarette okay interesting spot to park that's cu no parking on shoulder right there I don't know if you guys could see it that good but Mayhem welcome still dark here so you can't see much but I'm just walking got woken up from the wind blowing blowing the tarp off my tent and the rain and all that so about 3 hours ago and couldn't go back to sleep so I figured I'd walk around for a bit see if that helps me go back to sleep I do got to work later so so I actually went to sleep at like 11:00 but of course I got woken up Krabby don't apologize bro don't ever apologize for donating dude you know some people don't donate at all some people donate one time and that's it which is fine that's cool I appreciate that but don't ever apologize for not donating enough I mean you're not obligated to donate at all I just put it in the title just cuz I mean I haven't really asked in a while other than I did make a post I think it was yesterday or the day before but I didn't end up getting help so does that really count I mean it only counts if you actually get it right in my opinion but people talk crap no matter what I do so I figure you know people told me if you need help ask for it so I'm going to do that and it's been a while I mean I know some of you guys don't watch me that much but if you watch my streams daily you'll know I haven't really asked like over a week for sure like 10 days last time I even asked for anything at all don't hit me [Applause] dude Ste what's up man didn't see you [Applause] there hopefully everyone's doing [Applause]  well [Applause]  I don't know if you can see now the rain but it's kind of hard cuz my phone sucks at night time it's dark but I look up towards the light I can see it really [Applause] good anyways you can probably hear [Applause] it so it took 16 and 1 12 minutes to walk here so take about 16 and a half to walk back guess they still haven't found their dog I've seen these everywhere do not Chase lost on October 10th ooh that's a long time ago over a month ago sadly I don't know if the dog's going to ever be [Applause] found four people here with 13 [Applause] likes nice well not nice yeah that sucks but yeah sorry to hear that oh man the wind's picking [Applause] up oh man Joella welcome strong wind gust [Applause] right don't [Applause] appreciate [Applause] Ash Dash thank [Applause] you she's watching from Hong Kong not Africa but yeah that's say close enough but it's not really that close at all I think Hong Kong's closer to me than Africa is though cuz I'm on the west coast you know we just got the Pacific Ocean between us but yeah man this wind is no joke right now I'm like holding this umbrella as hard as I can I'm basically holding it down onto my head so it doesn't blow too much [Applause] man come on when just stopped for a little bit at least and I'm like at the bottom of the hill once I get to the top of this hill it might be worse of course it will be [Applause] yep rain sucks I don't really care like I said earlier if it's just raining or just cold or just raining and cold not that bad throw wind on top of that it's like three times [Applause] worse [Applause]  yeah a bunch of little branches and stuff on the ground nothing too big just little [Applause] ones I'll show you guys let me turn the light on show you [Applause] all well now you can see the rain but yeah see this that's a lot of freaking branches on the ground but just right there then it kind of oh there's a big one oh yeah that's pretty big see something like that hits my tent I am s so so hopefully that doesn't happen I was thinking about that all night from the time I got woken [Applause] up yeah it is Veterans Day here in the US so happy Veterans Day to all the [Applause] veterans I always think it's the Friday before cuz that's the day it's observed [Applause] so at least this year it was man this freaking rain [Applause] crazy SE two days ago nice yeah I wouldn't mind that right now honestly when summertime comes begging for it to just get a little bit colder but summer I definitely prefer summer when I'm living outside in a car I actually don't prefer summer if I'm living in a car I prefer like fall or spring personally but spring mostly cuz fall seems to be like the stormy season you know like I just said with the wind with branches falling and trees falling on power lines and spring doesn't really happen too much spring everything's like regrowing and stuff you know it's nice but my birthday is at the end of fall so it's pretty much almost winter time less than a month away from Christmas and winter well a month for my birthday is the day after Christmas so pretty much a month before Christmas but I say my birthday's in Fall I pretty much mean winter time cuz weather's crappy all the time you know there's only daylight for like 8 or N9 hours and it's almost always raining my birthday if it's not it'll be clear and sunny but super cold especially at night [Applause]  time uh sweet sugar whoever that was thank you I don't see him in the chat plus I missed them I don't know it's kind of hard to scroll cuz you know holding the umbrella with one hand and I'm doing everything with one hand with the [Applause] phone take care crabby I appreciate you oh man can you guys see the freaking rain my lens is probably too wet let me try to wipe it off hey you just can't see it that good but it's it's raining really good right [Applause] now just sweet thank you I appreciate you yeah you're awesome thank you I was wondering who that was [Applause] don't worry if you're new it's not a everyday thing that I do this so I've had people say like all you do is ask for help I'm unsub and it's like maybe when you watch me I am but if you watch me all the time I definitely don't do that all the time I definitely try not to but like like I said I know there's new people so might be new to you but people told me if I need help to ask for it so I do and trust me it's hard to ask for help and lots of people do that on YouTube even non homeless people do it so I don't really see the big deal about it personally but you know other people do quick to call someone a beggar and stuff man why is this wind just keep coming stop for a minute it's like every time I get to the bottom of the hill it's super [Applause] windy yeah exactly Amanda what's up welcome yeah you're right you know it is hard to ask though I'm not going to lie especially you know with a channel like mine but you know the funny thing about that there's like two other channels at least with the same name as mine they have more subs one guy has like 25,000 Subs the other guy has like I don't know six or 7,000 Subs I think but anyways they got the same channel name as me but they're not homeless they like Feed the Homeless or whatever but so that's what my goal was with this Channel and I mean it still is to this point but when I'm not homeless anymore I'm going to channel name the same so I'll just interview homeless people or whatever something like that just hard cuz a lot of people they don't like cameras and stuff so but I'm sure I could find someone I just I don't want to do it till I'm back on my feet so I could actually help him out you know what I mean right now I can't afford to give him anything so unless they want do an interview for free I could ask someone maybe [Applause] but F there yourself right on I mean not saying that's a good thing but at least you know how it is dude what both my feet just got super wet I think I stepped in a puddle or something but I didn't see it man if you guys could see the rain but it's coming down probably hear it though and the wind [Applause] Maybe [Applause] okay I'm gonna walk down this street it'll pop me out back down the road a little bit more but to extend this live a little bit longer on the way is it the street I can't remember no I think it's the next one wrong Street or I passed it but either way I could walk up here [Applause] light foot [Applause] welcome oh with two children dang yeah I used to till it broke down and got tow yeah that's a struggle in itself just worrying about gas and then people are constantly calling the cops on you for doing absolutely nothing at all just Liv in your car call the cops car's parked on the side of the road here it's like it's not a legal dude yeah I had to deal with that quite a bit said this many times on my channel but when I was living in a vehicle I had to deal with cops like a hundred more times than I have to deal with them now I think I've talked to a cop like twice since I've been outside but in the car it was like once every couple weeks at least once a [Music] month I was talking I'm going to go down here but yeah that's crazy isn't it like you're living in a car and you get harassed more than not living in a car now if I wasn't in a halfway decent spot with my camp and all that then I would have to deal with them too I'm just I'm in a decent spot right now so I mean I don't know how decent is I've been there for like 2 months I think but it's like it's a an abandoned lot there used to be like apartment buildings there and they got torn down so it's just a abandoned lot I mean I think someone still owns it but they don't maintain it I mean it's overgrown with sticker bushes and everything else there's like a there's a queen-sized bed 30 ft up in the tree like some homeless people were there before I think that's why that's there but yeah no one like maintains it or anything probably still paying taxes on or whatever but but yeah I'm actually in a decent spot for now I mean I've only had like two people come up to where I'm at and one was just like a week a week ago the other one was maybe a few weeks back or a month ago or something like yeah not too [Applause] bad I have no idea who you guys are talking about but feel free to not say who it is cuz it's someone that people should stay away from I would not be promoting the channel here I mean if you want to even like in the past I've shared another homeless guy's Channel then all it did was kind of screw me over I mean like I'd share him and then all a sudden people go over there and they be helping him and not me which is fine whatever but it's just kind of sucked for me you know what I mean especially because I mean the guy's Channel it has homeless in the name but he technically wasn't homeless at the time he had a place to live and but people would still rather help him than but it's it's all good I don't care I'm just saying it's a little weird so I tend to not share other people and I have trolls that stalk me like say I really like someone's channel right and I'm watching them well if I share them to my community tab my trolls are going to go into their Channel and talk tons of crap about me so I prefer to just not do that sadly if I didn't have to worry about that that would be cool but nope I got people that are obsessed with me so got nothing else to do with their time but harass a homeless dude claim I'm not homeless claim I'm a scammer what ever yep I have to with that so but it's to be expected I mean it's YouTube you know YouTube's full of trolls and then you throw on you know being homeless on top of that and yeah you got a lot to deal with though if you want to create content make sure you have thick skin because it it can be hard especially at first when people you know I didn't think I'd have to worry about that but it did happen so people make videos you know make Community posts call me a bum call me a scammer whatever I mean I guess if if you're homeless then you're a bum right so I guess I am a bum but it's just you know it's kind of rude to call someone [Applause] that light foot I agree I talk about this all the time on my channel how like other homeless people dude they ruin it for like some homeless people like myself you know like the homeless people that are like drug addicts and scammers and stuff like you know they ruin it cuz people like maybe they'll help a homeless person right then they'll find out that you know they spend it on drugs or alcohol or something and then they're like yeah I'm never helping a homeless person again that's why like even when I ask for help you know 90% of the time it's for food so you know I always throw that option out there if someone just wants to like call and order food or something I'll go get it you'll just have to like email me or text me or something cuz I ain't really just going to put it out there like publicly like yeah go order it here this location you know on my live cuz like I said I got trolls and Weirdos that I probably call the cops and say I got a gun or something I don't know people are crazy so you never [Applause] know yeah that's true Amanda but I mean everyone has their own opinion I guess yeah YouTube definitely dude even like you got to be careful too like so I have people text me and stuff but you never know if it's like you know cuz some troll right that's banned for my Channel that I already banned cuz you know they talk crap or whatever they could be watching me right now and then they could text me and say hey this is you know this is Amanda or whatever you know what I mean random person could do that so always got to be careful with that I always just use Amanda as an example sorry about that I did that last night too but just that was the first name I saw so but you know people are weird like that too so plus I've like I've been cool with people you know texting them back and forth and then all of a sudden a troll makes a video about me and then all of a sudden they hate me now it's like what because someone said something that they have no proof of at all now you hate me okay whatever guess it's not even worth having you as a subscriber anyway cuz you're just going to believe some BS someone said with no proof whatever yeah I mean I can defend myself but it's just a you know it's something I have to deal with so I was thinking I was considering changing my channel name but like I said even when I'm not homeless anymore I'm just going to interview homeless people or something anyway [Applause] so Ash Dash yeah bro I agree but you know they wanted to threaten me and cuz they actually live in Washington state believe it or not the person that uh that I'm talking about specifically but like I'm G to have my husband find him and kick his ass ever not that big of a city we'll find him it's like are you serious dude good luck I mean he can try I know the person themselves was like in their 50s I mean I'm 34 if I got 20 years of Youth on the dude I mean but yeah I was like 260 265 there back in like April or May someone wants to attack me go for it I will defend myself do that but yeah people are weird man they were totally cool with me and everything then someone troll says oh all homeless people are drug addicts and then they're like oh yeah he's a drug addict now all a sudden they think I'm drug addict meanwhile the person who said that was homeless themselves at the time but anyways I'm not going to mention names or anything [Applause] obviously nothing important so I just saw yeah I don't know why that happened oh man this wind's peing well I guess I probably made some people leave there's only oh man five people here dude this umbrella is literally about to blow away this is crazy yeah I'm I'mma end this here in like a minute anyway but I appreciate you thank you for stopping by feel free to stop by I go live every day so feel free to stop by anytime yeah probably is the rain or the wind or something enjoyed one of my interviews wait I guess I have been interviewed before if that's what you're talking about I also do a open panels and stuff like I did a 4H hour one last [Applause]  night I have not done any interviews myself I've been interviewed but I mean I've had people on my panel if that [Applause] counts yep thank you have a good day [Applause] anyways guys I am almost back to where I'm

antisemites' and shares headlines ...", "video_transcript": "hello America I'm Mark lvin and this is life liberty and lvin what do we do in a constitutional republic when we have a media that dresses up as the Free Press but really isn't what was intended by our framers of the Constitution oh the Press is free but the Press is free to lie to censor to cover up to Omit to project to Great narratives and that's what the American Press has done that's what they've done to Donald Trump that's what they've done to conservatives that's what they do about everything it is a radical element within our society it is part of the Democrat Party and is part of the American Marxist and now/ islamist mentality and I don't need to do a whole lot to prove it just spend a few hours doing research in fact I wrote an entire book on it un freedom of the press but I want to get into some specifics with you because at times like like this when there's an obvious right versus wrong good versus evil people trying to exterminate other people at a time like this you can really see who the culprits are who the reprobates are but a little bit of context first let's start with the New York Times I wrote a book chapter 6 on the New York Times during the Holocaust Deborah lipad who actually works for Biden right now why she hasn't resigned yet that's on her conscience called beyond belief an outstanding book on how the New York Times covered up the Holocaust buried by the times fantastic Professor Laurel Le the Holocaust and America's most important newspaper Dr David S Wyman since to Seas fantastic individual he wrote the first the abandonment of the Jews America and the Holocaust 1941 to 1945 you can see these are serious books serious people and it wasn't even just the Holocaust another great book Stalin's apologist Walter durandy by SJ Taylor this is the New York Times this is the New York Times the New York Times has blood on its hands in fact it was so bad that on its 150th anniversary the former managing editor of the New York Times felt well maybe I to write something about it Max Frankl November 14 2001 22 years ago and his first paragraph is and then there was failure none greater than the Staggering staining failure of the New York Times to depict Hitler's methodical extermination of the Jews of Europe as a horror beyond all other Horrors in World War II a Nazi war within the war crying out for illumination so the question has is has the New York Times learn anything this from tablet by Professor Le the New York Times is Nazi corresponded at the outbreak of the second world war the New York Times bureau chief from Berlin Guido enderis was known to sit in the bar of the city's famous Alden Hotel spell in quote a loudmouth defense of Nazism unquote eventually provoking another reporter to complain to the times publisher quote isn't it about time that the New York Times did something about its Nazi correspondent unquote but the times had no intention of doing anything about endurus in fact it as close connections to the Nazi government as it had throughout the 1930s All American newspapers found reporting in Nazi Germany difficult the government tightly controlled information and hared and threatened reporters who managed to publish what it didn't like the Nazi regime also didn't hesitate to use its strongest weapons Banning a newspaper from distribution in Germany kicking a reporter out of the country or denying a reporter's re-entry as a putatively Jewish owned newspaper the New York Times considered itself a special Target bureau chief Ender's job therefore was quote administering reasonably soothing syrup unquote to Nazi officials as another Times Reporter puts it when it comes to the fundamentals of life versus death the extermination of human beings by a regime the New York Times cited with quote unquote the regime in the manner in which it reported or didn't report information and it's doing exactly the same thing today despite its phony apology in 2001 here's the New York Post New York Times hires Hitler praising Salomon hiji to cover the Hamas War New York Times Reporter came under Fire last year for praising Adolf Hitler and multiple resurfaced Facebook posts was rehired by the gy lady to cover the Israel Palestine War when it was uncovered they dropped the guy but then enough time passed so they bring him back and now with October 7th they want him to help present information to you about what's going on in the war Palestinian filmmaker Soloman HEI hailed the Nazi leaders recently as 2018 in a post on Facebook when he shared a photo of himself captioned that he was quote in a state of Harmony as Hitler was during the Holocaust unquote that same year he she was hired by the times as a freelance journalist and worked on a slew of visual investigations published by the organization through 2021 including one on an Israeli air strike that killed 44 people his 2018 post including a 2012 Facebook post where he wrote quote how great you are Hitler in Arabic alongside a photoshopped image of Hitler seemingly taking a selfie at the time HEI didn't appear to be working for the Times anymore and had since taken down as controversial Pro Hitler post so why did they rehire him out all the people New York Times a few years back remember this anti-semitic cartoon well they they apologized for it but it was followed soon thereafter by this anti-semitic cartoon with the prime minister of Israel with a selfie taking a picture of himself you see his eyes with a uh starve David on a tablet the New York Times is loaded with Israel hating anti-semites just as it's loaded with American hating reporters opinion writers and so forth you have to ask yourself if you're a reporter for the New York Times you have any connection to the New York Times aren't you ashamed of yourself with the blood that this newspaper has on its hands and I can't do it right now but also 1932 Walter Durant was their correspondent in Moscow he was Stalin's mouthpiece for 12 years they knew it and in 1932 Stalin slaughtered millions of ukrainians something about the Russians Slaughter on ukrainians you know but they did it then too and the New York Times kept them and not only that he got a p Sur prize but the New York Times isn't alone here we have CNN the Jewish noon Syndicate CNN's anti-semitic disgrace a CNN analysis explains anti-Semitism by engaging in it CNN International platforms anti-semite to accuse Jews of racism Christian amanor and the institutionalization of media bias CNN reporting Palestinian grief but omitting Palestinian celebration of murder after October 7th CNN's May copal and Ali Hospital remember the fake headline from The New York Times they weren't alone CNN to but they slowly walked back then they apologized but they really didn't apologize they're not alone MSNBC among the worst of them they have a host here by the name of Medi Hassan few years back he was at an event and he spoke his true feelings and it was videotaped and he said and of course the kafar the disbelievers the atheists who remained deaf and stubborn to the teachings of Islam the rational message of Quran they're described in the Quran as quote a people of no intelligence Allah describes them as not of normal morality as people of no intelligence no morality people of no intelligence because they're incapable of the intellectual effort it requires to shake off those blind prejudices to shake off those easy assumptions about the world about the existence of God in this respect the Quran describes the atheists as cattle of those who grow the crops and do not stop and wonder about this world all these AMA unanimously agree that at the very minimum if you azid was not a cfir then at the very minimum he was a fi a transgressor a breaker of Islamic laws a corrupt individual a tyrant a killer a drunkard a dog lover a music lover a homosexual a pedophile sexual deviant someone who slept with his own mother these are their views not my view he says he since apologize they always apologize the New York Times is endlessly apologizing he's now a host on MSNBC MSNBC host Ali she's rabid Reckless anti-israel rant Jewish news Syndicate there wasn't violence there wasn't Bloodshed MSNBC whitewashes Al Sharpton's history The Daily wire MSNBC host Joy Reed criticized Jews among others anti-semitic rants homophobic rants racist rants anti-American rants that was what they found on her blog first she denied it was hers she said somebody put it up and used her name of course that was a lie and now she's a weekday Prime Time host at MSNBC I mean honestly they can't do better than this let's look at Media Matters this Soros front group that he helped create Media Matters is the research arm of the Democrat party slash Hamas supporting SL America hating media in this country that doesn't mean all the media but I've given you examples of many in the media have I not Media Matters president this is from The Daily Caller wrote blog posts about Japs jury and it's so fou with this Media Matters president Angelo Kiron wrote I can't even read it to you and this is the guy and this is the operation if you go to their web page now that's trying to destroy Fox and Rumble and individual hosts radio hosts yours truly and the media the media Ed this as a source CNN uses it MSNBC uses it New York Times Washington Post all the rest of them use it as a source why am I telling you all this because as I said at the start when you have a situation like we have today when you have the greatest genocide and atrocities against the people the Jewish people in Israel since the Holocaust and I have to sit here and sit on radio and explain what the media are doing how they're lying in support of Hamas how they're lying in support of terrorist regimes how they're lying against Israel how they use anti-semitic guests and hopes and hosts that's pretty sick and now you know why this media cannot be trusted the vast majority of it they attack Trump when they lie about the trials they lie about so much because they have an agenda they have an ideology and thanks to the Supreme cour Court under the New York Times decision versus Sullivan most of this is protected it wasn't protected at our founding when you actually could bring liable suits and win under state law the court decided in the early 1960s that this was free speech and it was to be protected at all costs fine the government doesn't interfere but what about individuals or groups of individuals they can't reply they have no standing to do anything which is why it gets worse and worse and worse and frankly which is why it's an honor to work here at Fox and an honor to work at West with one in my radio show with this kind of evil and hate these kinds of smears and lials which occur on a fairly regular basis in these newspapers these cable channels these network shows simply does

all across the world from Fort Benning to Korea and Germany he served in the military for 8 and 1/2 years so say happy Veterans Day to Ron and of course he's enjoying his Saturday out there but I'll tell you not the greatest days out there a lot of Veterans Day events had to be cancelled this morning meteorologist Bo Beth Yates in tonight and Bo Beth still not a great evening out there not a great evening at all this is a live look at our Midtown camera you can't see much look at it it's just really the U the clouds have rolled in patchy fog out there just a mix of if things just couldn't have been more dreary we just needed like something else to happen right now across the Metro just about low 50s for much of the Area 52 for Atlanta and that rain chances will continue as we go through the rest of the day overnight lows will get down into the mid to Upper 80s a little bit warmer for Dalton they're going to be at 50 but the rest of the Metro just about that 48 Dee Mark now those rain chances I told you about will continue now let's track it so by 8:00 we're going to see much of the area along the I20 Corridor experiencing some showers so we got Carolton Atlanta conures Covington area so that's what's going to happen by 8:00 but look what happens as we go overnight hours that's going to slowly start to move out of the area as it does we're going to wake up tomorrow morning with some light showers you want to give yourself a little bit of extra time tomorrow as you make it to worship sh worship worship service as you um get on the road because there will be some light showers still out there but for the for the most part it won't last all day by 12:30 just going to be clouds behind it and then those clouds will start making its way out of the area for the start of the work week now I'm going to give today our Sunday a six on the wizometer because of the morning showers now we're hoping it will make it up to about 60\u00b0 for the heights but relatively much of the area will be into the mid to Upper 50s and you would think all the rain we experienced would have helped with our drought conditions no not likely for much of the area we didn't even make it into 0.1 so those drought conditions still persist we got absolutely drought and as we make our way north to North Georgia extreme drought conditions still persist now those rain chances are coming back again we're going to have Sunday 70% chance of rain in the morning hours no rain on Monday but the rain coming back for the rest of the week slightly tapering off by Friday where it clears out sending it back to you well bet thanks so much taking a live look right now at Sanford Stadium tonight as the Bulldogs get ready for kickoff and just about an hour even the bad weather not keeping folks from getting in those stands we'll have more on that coming up tonight at 11: well right now in Atlanta bars have to stop serving alcohol at 2:30 a.m. but a proposal in Atlanta City Council could push closing time back 11 Al lives Don White has more on this proposed change it's a busy Friday night of fun and Friends Fido Irish PB and Buckhead when people come to Atlanta they come for hours NTI Atlanta city councilwoman Kesha wait says strugling bar and restaurant owner started reaching out to her about 8 months ago I started receiving phone calls from folks in the hospitality industry these are bars and restaurants that indicated that they had been devastated following coid so she sponsored a bill to push back last call at Atlanta businesses initially for 4:00 a.m. but she's amending the proposal after hearing about safety concerns the feedback that I have received from most individuals is that 4:00 m but theab has a 3:00 p.m. 3:00 a.m. closing hour to which we will mirror that we're looking at possibly on Sunday versus the 12: a.m. rule to push it back to 2:30 for those who watch football most of the customers we spoke to at the pub like the idea I think it could increase night life I mean that's part of the problem with Atlanta is that everything shuts down and nothing's happening so it will be a very positive and make it a more fun place I can see certainly from police standpoint they may have some concerns about it but as long as the bar owner is responsible and the bartender is watching their their clientele then I think it's fine weight says the bill would increase liquor licenses from 5,000 to $7500 per bar at an establishment we could potentially ensure that all APD officers have take-home vehicles with this increased Revenue to put cameras in areas that have historical patterns of crime and violence specific to the downtown area the Atlanta Public Safety Committee will weigh in on this during their Monday meeting well tonight we are learning more about a suspicious letter sent to the fton county elections office the letter has been intercepted as FBI divisions in six different states now work together to track down the cinder we first brought you this story on Thursday after Secretary of State Brad raffensberger announced a letter possibly laced with fentel was on its way to fton County the FBI says the letter is one of five that were mailed to election offices in Washington State Nevada Oregon California and Texas retired FBI agent Daniel Brunner says now that the letters are in the hands of authorities it'll be all handson deck to hunt down who mailed the letter they are going to be working very closely with the postal inspectors they are going to be getting all that material to quano to the labs to be tested they will be looking at the stamps at the DNA they will look at fibers they're going to try and determine the origin of the envelopes where they were purchased Secretary of State Brad raffensberger calling this an act of domestic terrorism he says Fulton County election workers have been given Naran and they've been trained on how to use it in case of an emergency well stay in Fulton County days from now election officials are set to recount all of the votes cast during Tuesday's election the countywide recount impacts about 36 different races Bo Beth Yates has a look this is a prime example that every vote counts city of South Bolton District 5 Council candidate shelle say she didn't expect her race to be so tight both my opponent and I Mr Bennett were both at 31% um it's only one vote he received four 104 and I receive 403 votes and then we have our incumbent who actually is at 38% so it's a very very tight race and with the race so close every vote counts in fact on Election Day Kelvin Bennett says he was speaking to voters and after describing his stance on gun control one new Resident committed to voting for him he went in he came back out and said he voted for me on that one issue and that right there is the one vote that may have put me ahead University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock says it's rare to have results that close and that the District 5 race already qualified for a recount because the results are half of a percentage Point different but he's shocked that all Fon County races are being reviewed I think it's surprising that they're going to recount the contests which were not within this half percentage Point margin and maybe it's because there are relatively few votes so you can do this pretty easily and as long as you're going through and reinspect these okay go ahead and check off all of them bck adds a countywide recount could be good practice for election officials as they get ready for the 2024 presidential race but for the District 5 candidates the recount comes with high stakes because none of the candidates met the 50% threshold to win the election which means there will be a runoff and usually only the the top two candidates can participate in that process just shows the importance of getting every vote out with just one vote separating myself and K shabel you know it's I'm sweating I'm sweating to see what's decided well tonight we are learning more about a new Statewide program we first told you about Thursday it's aimed at helping inmates successfully reintegrate into their society after prison well my goal would be one day in the state of Georgia that every single individual that is released is employed or at least has the opportunity now George's Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson is behind the Walking The Last Mile re-entry program he says it will help solve two of Georgia's biggest problems labor shortages and the states reset aism rate it's a personal issue for the commissioner he says his brother struggled for years to adjust to life outside the system but eventually he took his own life we heard that same story around the state of Georgia on both sides of the aisle this is not a Republican or Democratic issue this is a societal issue within the program Georgia's Department of Labor will act as the ultimate recruitment school by pairing participants with thousands of different employers to help get them back on the right track it will include up to 70 people taking part at first but commissioner Thompson hopes it will eventually be an option for all former inmates", "aigc_title": "Fire Displaces Dozens at Atlanta Apartment Complex, Red Cross Sets Up Temporary Shelter", "aigc_article": "Catch the latest on 11Alive News at 6 p.m. where 28 people are

this nice weather here which will be for a few more days 42 here in Salt Lake City mostly clear skies now it feels like 37 light wind out of the South and that'll keep us a little warmer than it was last night now today's high temperature was 54 average for today 53 over 34 so not too far from that of interest is the record low of today is 15 and it's not from 1911 because the November 11th 1911 storm called the Great Norther that broke records all across the country but it looks like our record was from a different Year and that was from the year 2000 our sunset tonight at 513 getting ever so close to that 5:00 hour on the Sundown 29 in Park City it's 42 in Salt Lake and we're still in the 30s in Southern Idaho 24 here at Bryce Canyon cold night for you you'll be in the teens 51 over in St George so we've had some high cloud cover that went through earlier tonight but you can see there's not too much action going on we're actually just going to be stuck with some high pressure around all we really can expect on and enough the next couple of days are some clouds and not a lot of moisture so here's the pattern and this will take us through later in the week so let's watch this cool colorful graphic here where it kind of shows some of the Jet Stream flow so you've got high pressure around and that's just Meandering as we get this big Ridge in the jet stream and then there is an area of low pressure that we're watching that'll be off the coast of California later in the week so more toward the end of the week is when we'll start to see our chance at any moisture with that right now doesn't look all that impressive but hey crush your fingers and maybe it'll bring us some active weather Thursday Friday and the next weekend for tonight mostly clear skies should be prettyy quiet 30s tonight here in Salt Lake and 34 in St George so just a couple degrees warmer than we were last night and then tomorrow a few degrees warmer than we were today so 57 here in Salt Lake City for tomorrow afternoon 62 in Provo we'll have partly cloud sky so we'll start off the day with a good deal of sunshine and then we'll have some broken cloud cover in the afternoon in Northern Utah sunshine in the southern portion of the state and gorgeous temperatures were in the upper 60s here a little bit of a breeze there on Tuesday you can see the increase in cloud cover toward the end of the week as that system moves on Shore a little bit until then pretty quiet 50s and 60s I we'll take it here in early November that's really nice weather so it is going to be pretty dry through the

a DEC coordinator I'm going put three on him at all times you know what I mean so you know Brock he definitely has eyes on him and it allows other things to open up you know and it showed when other things open up we could dish it right back to Brock or things like that it just shows the whole variety of the offense and we got to give all the things to that that coach Bobo every week he draws up the perfect game plan he draws up the opportunity he puts us in the place to be successful you know what I mean you can't be successful if you just out there doing whatever he puts us in the position to be successful so got to give all the thanks to him you don't think you're peing at the right time I mean this is about as complet nowhere near the peak nowhere near the peak not even close really we at we we're at the base still nowhere near the peak how it feel when you're nowhere near the peak to be you won the E and now you know you're going to the champ I mean it just motivates you to go

clicking on all cylinders tonight what kind of statement did that make offensively I mean to be honest it it it started on Monday in practice you know this week of practice I'm not going to lie like we were getting after it it was hard hitting it was like you would have thought that we were really had like real beef out there between the offense and the defense type of practice it was you know but you know that's what fuels us that's what makes us better every single week so I can't I can't wait to get back to another physical weekend and you know get back to work why do you think that was the case this week I mean why do you think that was a little different was it because it was a top 10 match up and I mean to be honest us as a team we have to keep it real with oursel you know we have to know when we didn't play our best game we have to know when we didn't achieve the things that we wanted to achieve and you know we take that personal you know we have our own our own we call our own team meetings you know what I mean like we make it known when the standards not being achieved and you know I feel like everybody took that personal especially before the game any player on the

Robert Gough talks to Hannibal's retiring superintendent of schools Susan Johnson about her 30-plus years in ...", "video_transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to mudy River news this week furnished by Harvey's I'm Bob gof Susan Johnson is the superintendent of Han public schools for about another half a year she is getting ready to retire and she's my guest today welcome thank you very much for having me today I appreciate it far too young to retire what are you doing oh God I bless you I'm not as young as you'd think but I appreciate you saying so 30 years 33 years actually 33 yeah I've in all 33 years and I this is something I always wanted I could always say all of my years have been in the Hannibal School District it's like that ball player who just plays for the one team you know yeah that's you did and you went up through the ranks and uh you know becoming superintendent you know I remember when Jill James was superintendent and then you you know filled in after that and you've uh made a few changes which is what everybody does when they come in but uh it really looks like the Hannibal School District's got a lot of positive stuff going on as you get ready to say bye or say I'll see you later they do and it's it's hard to say goodbye because I mean as corny as it may sound I mean when you spend this kind of time with people um you know they're part of me and uh you know it's like having a family and I know that seems not genuine but I truly mean that uh when I talk to the administrative team uh and that was a really difficult conversation to Ann to make my announcement um I got to looking around that room and every single person in that room I had hired and that was really um I very proud of that but it was also an aha moment you know one that you don't reflect on many times but I think when you're in that situation I think you look back and you have to take some not only Pride but also comfort in the fact that you know these these guys will be okay without me they're going to be great without me and I know know uh anytime there's change and I've talked to many people and some people saying they're nervous or scared and change can be nervous or scary but you know a big reason why this time has come is you know this the Hannibal school district is doing phenomenally and there's great leadership there um the staff is phenomenal and they they do everything uh so I'm just the the one that has good fortune to be able to to take many times credit that it really isn't mind to take I mean I've had a lot of uh friends and family who you know have had kids who've graduated through their nephews and such but I've also got a lot of my wife teaches over here in Quincy I've got a lot of her friends who also have are teaching over there and they just have they've had nothing but good things to say about teaching in Hannibal well thank you that that always makes me proud to hear that um and you know it's it really is a community you know when you work in a school system and it's not about you know who does what or these kinds of things because really the truth is we all have to do our part to make it work and I'm really blessed and fortunate our community is very blessed and fortunate to have people that are just so very dedicated and uh really will do whatever it takes to to help our kids flourish I think one of the biggest adjustments in education in over the last few years has been the fact that for years it was like okay we're gonna get our degree in high school or get get our diploma then we're gonna go to college and now we've really got this change like look we we need to realize that not every kid needs College not every kid wants college and you know with with what you've got going on with the development center and I mean you know Hannibal votech I you when I was at Mark Twain I had friends who classmates who went to Hannibal votc back then and ended up you know working on cars or graphic design or whatever and here we are 30 some odd years later and it's the same thing but now it looks like you're really giving them a lot more tools with this development expansion of of the old you know Jack southernland chco whatever that building's been over the years but that that looks like a really good opportunity there's a lot of things that I'm excited for the future for Hannibal school district and not really just even Hannibal School District really the the region um and you know when when we were fortunate enough to purchase Southerland you know that's not a one person show that took a lot of people and a lot of forethought a lot of vision uh but the opportunities that un mass for our kids for our community for even the adults in our community and our region is really um you know the sky the limit and what a perfect time you know having all of us come out of the pandemic when we're dealing with so many Workforce issues and what opportunities um that this will open up to you know really helping our students and not just Hannibal students but our sing school students our area students to be able to get a job skill that's really not only going to help them but it's going to help us keep some of our kids if they want to to stay here local versus them feeling like they have to go somewhere else to get good employment I think it also opens up a ton of opportunities for economic development um and just expansion of the community as a whole which is going to be a win-win for everybody concerned you that is that is the biggest thing I mean you know my wife and I we have three kids and two are gone and one's at Illinois state right now and we think there might be a chance to get him back but I know a lot of you know but my nephew who lives in uh well lives in saberton but works in Hannibal now and stuff and you know he's trying to decide what he wants to do because he's an apprentice electrician and stuff so it's just the fact of trying to get you know those kids who like sure go go see the world for a little bit but you know eventually come on back home yeah you know and that's something that amazed me because I'm not originally from Hannibal um but I've lived in Hannibal more than I've lived anywhere else in my entire life including my hometown but really you know I I've always really admired Hannibal because Hannibal is a large small town and you know I think a lot of people forget that you know because um it's a it's a large Town comparatively to other communities around us but it doesn't feel like a large town and I like that about Hannibal and and speaking of people coming back you know a lot of our staff are people who have elected to come back and want to live in that community that they have so many fond memories and of course then you've got all of the great tourism and things the different um festivals that we have and whatnot that just make that in the Arts my gosh it's just makes it a rich community and being right here near near Illinois in the tri-state area it's it's just optimal I I knew you were not a native hannahan where where are you from originally I'm from around Warburg Missouri oh okay uhhuh but uh I always say that when people ask where you're from because you know as you get older I'm thinking I've lived here a lot longer than I live there so uh but no that's where I'm from originally but like I said you know I came here when I was 18 years old and I've not left so um you know I I said I guess I'm a person that you find someplace you just want to stick and I like what I had and fortunate enough to be able to stick around as uh as this transition year for you uh is underway to your uh your retirement from Hannibal what uh are you involved at all in the process of of whom your successor is going to be um our school board is working with the Missouri school boards Association for the for the superintendent search and so far uh they have sent out a survey to the community and that information is now in and I know we have a board meeting coming up uh and it's always good to get that feedback from you know our community because really when you're a superintendent it's not just a school district thing it's a big part of the community you know which is part of the great thing about being a superintendent so um you know as far as um Andrea Campbell our PR person is really uh taking an active role in helping push those things out to try to get that input now we're taking applications and so as far as my input with that you know the board has um you know and you know I don't ever want to slow things down and I want to be where the board allows me to be and I definitely have a vested interest in the district and I want to make sure and I'm sure there'll be a great person coming to take it forward but they're going to allow me to you know be a part in the respect of once interviews are set up and uh whether it be the first round interviews or second round interviews I know they um they expressed you know Susan would you be able to talk to them and you know because people will have questions you know about the school district naturally and I would love to be able to do that set those you know set those individuals up for Success uh and then taking them for tours around the district things of that nature so um I'm grateful for that you know and there's you know I'm I'm leaving on good terms uh I've been here a long time and this is important uh to me and I want to set set whoever comes into this into this position It's a Wonderful position I want to give them every tool I can offer to them if they want them uh to help them have a great uh career and experience in this great District what are you gonna do just G to go fishing or what that's a that's probably the biggest question I get and I wish I had some like really great answer but I think um my husband is retired and so um I know that we want to travel you know when you live the life of an educator anytime you're able to travel it's usually during those Peak Seasons you know in the summer when when things the way they are and anyone that works you know you've got schedules and things so I'd like to see the world a little bit uh and explore and kind of see what's out there and experience that um and I I I really just want to continue to try to make a difference in this world and maybe do some some Community opportunities things like that just uh supportting ing kids I've always wanted to be a mentor to students uh and I always was hesitant to do that not because I didn't want to because I just I wanted whatever I did I wanted to be um them to be able to count on me and sometimes when you're in a leadership role you know duty calls and you've got to go take care of things and I that's important so I'm not sure what that's going to look like I'm still figuring all that out and I guess I've got time but but um it's going to be an adjustment but but I mean aside from travel animals going to stay home base well actually uh my husband and I um we ended up uh relocating and I'm still living here obviously but we bought a a townhouse in Columbia Missouri we have one daughter and she lives in Colombia and we have some family members um you know it's kind of a good location because we're kind of between my family and his and as our as our family ages you know we want to be there and be able to do our part with that so we'll be doing that I want to give whoever becomes a superintendent uh an opportunity to to get their own identity sometimes when you've been in a district for a long time um it's easy to to go to those people and and ask questions and things and I would never want that to be and I I'll work hard that that's not but I still have things I'll be involved with the Hannibal Community even after I retire um this you know the Hannibal Community has been very very good to me and my family and I definitely want to be able to give back to that well being in missou I'm I'm I fully support living in Columbia absolutely uh final question as you uh as you prepare for this what are what's your what are you proudest of the people easily I could say that easily you know one thing that has been probably the the thing that I cherish the most you know a lot of people would say gosh if you know if you stay one place for a long time you don't get to see a lot of things that other places offer and things like that and I and I do believe that's true but one of my best things I've I've really really enjoyed is I've been around long enough that and we almost have a joke in our district that when parents come in uh I'll say well I had them in fifth grade you know when I taught yeah and it's just nice to see that cycle of life you know to where these children that I loved as their teacher or as their principal now have children and sometimes grandkids in our district and just seeing that life circle go around and and you know it's so refreshing because I already have relationships with them and um that is a blessing and just you know even our staff whether it's our you know classified staff or our certificated staff you know being able to I can't tell you how many students uh former students that are now employed in our district and you know it's kind of like being a mom you know even though I'm not their mother it's it's it's just a that's a huge source of Pride and just to think maybe I made a difference with just one person you know I think that's what all of our responsibilities are is trying to hopefully something I did will will have made it better for someone else well you've certainly made an impact and I want to say thank you for your service and best of luck going forward thank you so much I really appreciate it and thank you for for doing this even though this is hard but I I really do uh appreciate uh this time all right thank you well that's Susan Johnson and I'm Bob Goff and we'll see you next [Music]   week",

Highs today, only in the thirties and forties statewide off to our west though, you see that area of low pressure and warm front, standing out in front of it. That is *** weak weather system that is going to move in here by late tomorrow. And with it, we could see *** few scattered rain and snow showers. The weekend will end on *** dry note though, with *** lot of sun sunshine, it is still chilly and *** lighter breeze compared to the past couple of days. High temperatures today won't get out of the thirties up north. Places like Plymouth into Lincoln, Lancaster, Whitefield and much of the Great North Woods highs will be limited to the thirties. But once you get into the Mount Washington Valley, the Lakes region and Point South, we should get back into the forties again. All of us enjoying that lighter wind and that'll be great news for runners participating in the Manchester City Marathon today at Veterans Park. Start time just before nine o'clock this morning. It will be chilly though with temperatures only around freezing in the Queen City but with sunshine and *** slow warming trend along with that lighter breeze. I think this is really optimal running weather for runners, especially by midday and early afternoon tonight. *** clear and cold night, some sheltered valleys like Concord White Field up into Errol and Mylan, you'll drop back into the upper teens, the rest of us in the twenties. By very early on Monday morning, here's how tomorrow breaks down in the capital city. *** sunny and chilly start though with some sunshine, we warm back into the forties during the afternoon, clouds will increase very late in the day. And by tomorrow evening, there could be *** few scattered rain and snow showers. Here's how I think it breaks down on futurecast again. *** dry cool start to Monday sunshine giving way to increasing afternoon clouds but any rain or snow showers will probably hold off until after dark for most of us. You see the coverage here. These will be scattered around. Not every town is necessarily going to get *** shower tomorrow, but by tomorrow evening, it could be cold enough that some flakes could fall. And especially in central and northern New Hampshire where there could just be some scattered coatings, perhaps *** lingering rain or snow shower into very early Tuesday morning that Tuesday will turn breezy with *** mix of sun and clouds and there probably will be *** few lingering snow showers in the white mountains and the Great North Woods. So still below average for the next couple of days, keep my normal high. This time of year sits right around 50. So at least five or so degrees below average today tomorrow and through Tuesday. But then *** slow warming trend for mid to late week. By Thursday, we're back in the fifties with some sunshine overall, pretty quiet stretch of weather. Other than that risk for *** few scattered rain and snow showers starting tomorrow evening into very early Tuesday. We're back to full sun Wednesday and Thursday.

here and this is for Wednesday Thursday and Friday it could be on and off for times but it will be prolonged we'll continue to see that rain uh through much of the end of the week as it continues to

This week case three investigates spoke to people whose water has been contaminated by nitrate. What's nitrate? It's an odorless and colorless chemical compound in infants.

from WVUE: https://www.fox8live.com/ For more ...", "video_transcript": "well a new trend called cold water therapy has a growing number of people raving about the health benefits joining us today is Dr Eric Griggs discussing how ice baths can relieve muscle tension reduce swelling and boost one's mood good morning Dr Griggs good morning so let's start with the fact that I know this is a new trend and if you've been on social media you've been on Instagram you may have seen some some people out there who have been pushing these ice baths uh um on social media taking an ice bath for athletes is not a new trend that's something they've been doing for years not just athletes there have been cold bodies of water and ice around for a long P time that people have dared to jump in to get a burst of energy and feel alive sure people take cold showers sometimes in the morning because they want to wake up uh there's a lot of things about it but if you're going to be one of those people who might be susceptible to marketing on social media look we all I think all of us at one time or another have been when it comes to these ice baths what should people really know are they safe are there actual health benefits that are backed by science so the actual health benefits uh the the science of it all is that it causes a cold it causes blood vessel constriction uh particularly in your arms and legs that help can help after an intense workout to reduce inflammation increase uh recovery it can cause a dopamine relief uh because it's stress it's the equivalent of going to jump in a lake a cold lake your body turns on the fight ORF flight response that can get released endorphin endorphins and dopamine but it's not for long period to time that's what I was going to ask next is when is it when should you use this and how long and you just answered probably if you're person who's already living a very healthy lifestyle you work out regularly sometimes those workouts I mean look I'm not I'm no spring jenking I like to lift weights you know this it my recovery like my muscles are sore for days when you heavy heavy stuff and put it down right but doc it didn't used to be that way I used to be able to get over it in like a day I'm like I'm still sore from a workout I had three days ago so if I'm living that kind of Lifestyle I'm in my 30s or whatever and I want to take an ice bath how long should I actually sit in it and like you already answered the question you really want to try to schedule it after an intense workout yeah it's typically no longer than 5 to 10 minutes if you want to start you can start with a tub you don't necessarily have to divide a device to hold water and ice uh you can start with 5 minutes uh and you start with the temperature at about 58\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 uh cool and then slowly put in the ice cooling it to no more than 53 degrees uh because you don't want to fall into a situation where you start to cause damage however before you do any of this you want to make sure that you talk to your doctor uh uh coal bass and and and exposure to Coal can cause heart conditions uh can irritate nerves there are certain medical conditions that this could not be good for sure so sitting in it for too long can be damaging and also if you're somebody who again is not you're maybe trying to jump start a new uh positive trend some create some good habits but if you're somebody who you know maybe a little out of shape maybe trying to get in better shape you don't don't just jump into an ice cold bath with no uh prep or no uh warning for your system yeah the first thing you want to do is talk to your healthcare provider and ask is this safe for you if you have health conditions uh and then I would I would probably advise seeing if you can tolerate this at all uh we like finishing with your morning shower with a splash of cold and if you don't like it don't do it um even even though they say that you know part of the benefits is mental strength and meditation and mental acuity because you're uh learning to focus the whole n find out what works best for you and you can tolerate but first talk to your doctor see if it's a good idea uh typically it's not more than twice a week uh if even if you're working out that you want to do this even though there are some celebrities that swear by it and will do it regularly that's trying to make sure we're careful of is that it doesn't mean that there aren't actual health benefits it doesn't mean there's not truth to it but that's why it's important to have you on to make sure we aren't giving we're giving the full picture yeah the people that do this regularly like PL if you're an athlete if you're high school college professional they work out intensely for a living they do this daily uh they need the Muscle Recovery so becoming a part of their train under their routine under the supervision of a healthcare provider team and medical and professionals is a good thing got it as always thank you so much Dr Eric Griggs appreciate you", "aigc_title": "Dr. Eric Griggs Discusses the Therapeutic Benefits and Safety of Ice Baths", "aigc_article": "Discover the therapeutic

from WVUE: https://www.fox8live.com/ For more ...", "video_transcript": "well a new trend called cold water therapy has a growing number of people raving about the health benefits joining us today is Dr Eric Griggs discussing how ice baths can relieve muscle tension reduce swelling and boost one's mood good morning Dr Griggs good morning so let's start with the fact that I know this is a new trend and if you've been on social media you've been on Instagram you may have seen some some people out there who have been pushing these ice baths uh um on social media taking an ice bath for athletes is not a new trend that's something they've been doing for years not just athletes there have been cold bodies of water and ice around for a long P time that people have dared to jump in to get a burst of energy and feel alive sure people take cold showers sometimes in the morning because they want to wake up uh there's a lot of things about it but if you're going to be one of those people who might be susceptible to marketing on social media look we all I think all of us at one time or another have been when it comes to these ice baths what should people really know are they safe are there actual health benefits that are backed by science so the actual health benefits uh the the science of it all is that it causes a cold it causes blood vessel constriction uh particularly in your arms and legs that help can help after an intense workout to reduce inflammation increase uh recovery it can cause a dopamine relief uh because it's stress it's the equivalent of going to jump in a lake a cold lake your body turns on the fight ORF flight response that can get released endorphin endorphins and dopamine but it's not for long period to time that's what I was going to ask next is when is it when should you use this and how long and you just answered probably if you're person who's already living a very healthy lifestyle you work out regularly sometimes those workouts I mean look I'm not I'm no spring jenking I like to lift weights you know this it my recovery like my muscles are sore for days when you heavy heavy stuff and put it down right but doc it didn't used to be that way I used to be able to get over it in like a day I'm like I'm still sore from a workout I had three days ago so if I'm living that kind of Lifestyle I'm in my 30s or whatever and I want to take an ice bath how long should I actually sit in it and like you already answered the question you really want to try to schedule it after an intense workout yeah it's typically no longer than 5 to 10 minutes if you want to start you can start with a tub you don't necessarily have to divide a device to hold water and ice uh you can start with 5 minutes uh and you start with the temperature at about 58\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 uh cool and then slowly put in the ice cooling it to no more than 53 degrees uh because you don't want to fall into a situation where you start to cause damage however before you do any of this you want to make sure that you talk to your doctor uh uh coal bass and and and exposure to Coal can cause heart conditions uh can irritate nerves there are certain medical conditions that this could not be good for sure so sitting in it for too long can be damaging and also if you're somebody who again is not you're maybe trying to jump start a new uh positive trend some create some good habits but if you're somebody who you know maybe a little out of shape maybe trying to get in better shape you don't don't just jump into an ice cold bath with no uh prep or no uh warning for your system yeah the first thing you want to do is talk to your healthcare provider and ask is this safe for you if you have health conditions uh and then I would I would probably advise seeing if you can tolerate this at all uh we like finishing with your morning shower with a splash of cold and if you don't like it don't do it um even even though they say that you know part of the benefits is mental strength and meditation and mental acuity because you're uh learning to focus the whole n find out what works best for you and you can tolerate but first talk to your doctor see if it's a good idea uh typically it's not more than twice a week uh if even if you're working out that you want to do this even though there are some celebrities that swear by it and will do it regularly that's trying to make sure we're careful of is that it doesn't mean that there aren't actual health benefits it doesn't mean there's not truth to it but that's why it's important to have you on to make sure we aren't giving we're giving the full picture yeah the people that do this regularly like PL if you're an athlete if you're high school college professional they work out intensely for a living they do this daily uh they need the Muscle Recovery so becoming a part of their train under their routine under the supervision of a healthcare provider team and medical and professionals is a good thing

WE YES, WE NEED THE RAIN SO BAD. AND I JUST I LOVE SEEING ALL THE EDUCATION COME BACK TO LIFE AFTER THIS HORRIBLE DROUGHT WE'VE BEEN IN. BUT STILL, WE'RE STILL VERY MUCH IN THAT DROUGHT. ABSOLUTELY. AND COMING UP, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THIS RAIN COULD POTENTIALLY HELP THE DROUGHT. HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. STEADY LIGHT RAIN TODAY AND TOMORROW. RIGHT NOW IT'S LITTLE SPOTTY, BUT IT'S GOING TO BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD. IN FACT, WE EXPECT ONE TO 2 INCHES OF RAIN WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE BY TUESDAY MORNING. AND SPEAKING OF TUESDAY, THAT'S WHERE WE WILL SEE THE SUNSHINE RETURNS. SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE RADAR RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN SEE ON YOUR SCREEN THAT THE RAIN IS PRETTY SPOTTY AT THE MOMENT. BUT WE ARE STAYING STEADY LIGHT RAIN THROUGH SAN ANTONIO THROUGH AREAS LIKE MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL LEE HIGH SCHOOL WINDCREST KIRBY JBSA RANDOLPH SELMA AREA LIVE OAK AREA. ALSO SEEING SOME OF THAT RAIN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO THE NORTH AND TO THE EAST NEAR TO NEW BRAUNFELS. IT IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY RAINY DAY FOR THE LAST DAY OF WORSE FAST AS WELL. AND THEN FURTHER ON DOWN TO THE SOUTH, SOME LIGHT RAIN FOR AREAS IN WILSON COUNTY, ATASCOSA COUNTY IN NEAR KENNEDY. ALSO SEEING SOME LIGHT RAIN NEAR DEVINE. BUT AGAIN, THIS IS A STEADILY MOVING FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH. AND WE THE RAIN TO REALLY PICK UP LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE RAIN CHANCES WIDESPREAD THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AT 70% OVERNIGHT, 80%, ON MONDAY. IT WILL FINALLY START TO SEE THE RAIN AND BY TUESDAY. STILL, THOUGH, THIS IS MUCH NEEDED RAIN, EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING TO CAUSE A BIT OF A DAMPER FOR ANY KIND OF OUTDOOR PLANS. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE FUTURECAST SPOTTY RIGHT NOW. BUT THEN WATCH WHAT HAPPENS AS WE HEAD CLOSER TO NOON MORE WIDESPREAD LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN. IT IS WORTH NOTING WE DO NOT EXPECT THUNDER AND LIGHTNING. THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE STEADY, LIGHT RAIN. SO IF YOU HAVE KIDS PATS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO LIGHTNING AND MAYBE WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE AS WE SEE RAIN BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD OVERNIGHT. THAT'S ALL IT'S GOING TO BE RAIN. NO STORMS EXPECTED. AND AGAIN, THAT WILL HAPPEN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. MORE WIDESPREAD RAIN BY THE MORNING COMMUTE TOMORROW. IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY DAMP OUTSIDE. SO TAKE SOME TIME NOW TO CONSIDER GIVING YOURSELF SOME EXTRA TIME. MAX SARAH AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW WE DO NOT LOVE DRIVING IN THE RAIN, BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE EARLY TOMORROW MORNING AND THROUGH OUT THE DAY TOMORROW BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DONE UNTIL LATE TOMORROW NIGHT. THE RAINFALL IS GOING TO BE WITH US ALL DAY TOMORROW AS WELL. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR KSAT 12, OUR FORECAST JUST FOR THE DAY TODAY, TEMPERATURES IN THE 50'S RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO STAY ALL DAY LONG. WE'LL SEE MORE WIDESPREAD RAIN THIS AFTERNOON. NOTICE THAT RAIN CHANCES JUMP UP TO ABOUT 70% THIS AFTERNOON. AND TODAY JUMP UP EVEN MORE LATER ON TONIGHT, 80 TO 90% CHANCE FOR COVERAGE OF RAIN. SO HOW WILL THIS IMPACT THE DROUGHT? HERE'S A LOOK AT THE CURRENT DROUGHT MONITOR ALL OF US ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS CAN USE SOME RAIN, ESPECIALLY AREAS LIKE VICTORIA BEEVILLE AND ESPECIALLY OVER THE SAN ANTONIO METRO AREA. SMACK DAB IN SAN ANTONIO IS WHERE THE WORST DROUGHT IS, ESPECIALLY IN WEST SAN ANTONIO. AND IT'S IN THESE AREAS THAT WE EXPECT ONE TO 2 INCHES OF RAIN WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE BY TUESDAY MORNING. SO WE'RE LIKELY GOING TO AT LEAST PUT A DENT IN THE DROUGHT, WHICH IS GOOD NEWS. TEMPERATURES STAYING IN THE 50'S ALL DAY TODAY, ALL DAY TOMORROW WITH THAT RAIN AND THEN BY TUESDAY WE'LL SEE SOME SUN TEMPERATURES WARMING, BUT NOT TOO WARM. IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE IN THE 70'S.

POLICE STILL SEARCHING FOR WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. IT HAPPENED FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE 300 BLOCK OF CERALVO STREET JUST BEFORE NOT WITNESSES WHO ARE WITH THE VICTIMS SAY THE GUNSHOTS WENT THROUGH THE WINDOW. POLICE SAY NO SHELL CASINGS EVEN FOUND ON THE SCENE. DON'T EVEN HAVE A POSSIBLE VEHICLE OR SUSPECT DESCRIPTION AT THE TIME. THEY'RE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.

SO IT INCLUDES EXTENDING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SOME AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS UNTIL AT LEAST MID-JANUARY CONTINUING TO FUND MORE UNTIL FEBRUARY. 2ND, JUST KIND OF APPROACH. IT'S UNUSUAL FOR A STOPGAP SPENDING BILL. USUALLY LAWMAKERS EXTEND FUNDING UNTIL A CERTAIN DATE FOR ALL PERMITS WITH THE NEW HOUSE SPEAKER. ONCE YOU USE THIS APPROACH TO ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WHO WANT TO AVOID BEING PRESENTED WITH THAT MASSIVE SPENDING BILL JUST DAYS BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS, WHICH HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST. SO IF THIS STOPGAP PLAN DOES FALL THROUGH, THE PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WOULD KICK IN NEXT WEEKEND. >> THE IRS HAS JUST ANNOUNCED NEW TAX BRACKETS FOR 2024 AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOME PEOPLE CAN END UP.

SO SOME OF THE CHANGES WILL START WELL AFFECT THE STANDARD TO TOP DEDUCTION FOR SINGLE FILERS AND MARRIED COUPLES FILING JOINTLY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND THE INCOME THRESHOLD. THE AGENCY BOOSTED THE INCOME THRESHOLD FOR EACH BRACKET TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION. THIS MEANS SOME PEOPLE COULD BENEFIT BY BEING ABLE TO REMAIN IN A LOWER TAX BRACKET.

Next week looks mainly ...", "video_transcript": "welcome back a chilly start to the day but we are tracking a storm system offshore that's going to warm those temperatures up as we head towards midday sitting at about 52 out toward the Oregon coast right now 40s across the W lamit Valley chilly start to the day that fog down towards Roseberg is mainly a little bit high in the atmosphere it is cloudy but we're not dealing with any visibility issues there that camera is a little bit uh higher on the terrain down towards Roseberg but here's the storm system right offshore I wouldn't cancel plans just yet it's mainly just going to be some light showers as we head toward the course of the afternoon but you can see very impressive storm system right offshore Cloud deck essentially from BC all the way down into the Central Pacific and that is going to bring us rain chances later today so if you do want to have those outdoor plans uh maybe uh head towards brunch or those Sunday Services you shouldn't need any rain gear this morning as we head toward the afternoon though we are going to start to see those showers pick up for the coast first spreading Inland across Lam Valley as we head towards the evening so it's really late today into Monday morning and then it starts to move out as we head toward next week we're actually tracking a drier week ahead there's a storm system that originally was supposed to move over Oregon but it looks like it's going to be taking a southernly detour and that's going to bring us relatively dry conditions next week in fact by Thursday Friday we may see completely sunny skies across the region something that we haven't seen here across Western Oregon for quite some time let's time things out you can see the cold front right offshore heavier rain thunderstorms Focus just off the coast of Newport as we head towards around midday but you can see kind of what we're seeing now a few sun breaks out there but mostly cloudy skies as we head toward the evening though you can see right around 6:30 or so rain picking up toward the Oregon coast I think this model is lagging a little bit I would expect some showers to start picking up for the coast as early as around 4 p.m. or so probably areas like Eugene Corvalis as we head toward around 6:30 7:00 in the evening you can see rain picking up overnight tonight but as soon as this front moves in it's going to be out of here we are going to be tracking some light snow across the passes but I wouldn't expect any issues for your uh commute if you're driving out towards Bend or Eugene mainly just a light mix overnight tonight and into Tuesday morning as we head toward the louer part of the week you can see shower chances building for Tuesday into Wednesday and they're going to be very light you can see they're actually coming in from the south and there's a reason why it's due to that area of low pressure that's kind of breaking away from the overall flow and we'll take a closer look at that coming up rain totals though with this front passing overnight tonight into tomorrow are very light you can see anywhere from a third to a half inch across the region some localized heavier amounts but check this out next week actually looks mostly dry that storm system on the Tuesday Wednesday time frame is training a little bit further south so we're going to see mainly dry conditions even for the Tuesday Wednesday time frame and by next Thursday and Friday I would expect mainly sunny skies across the region before what looks like another wet weekend as we head toward next Saturday and Sunday so let's take a broader look you can see the cold front moving through as we head toward the day today that passes off to the east we have drier weather as we head towards Monday afternoon but here's this area of low pressure it's originally up towards BC kind of breaks off from the overall flow Dives down into California bringing the scare Nevada some snow but notice we Trend mostly dry across Oregon and that is going to be the trend at least for Thursday and Friday but that rain does return once again for the Oregon coast as we head toward Saturday again temperatures mainly in the 50s and 60s across areas of Roseberg 60\u00b0 Sunday afternoon as we head toward the rest of the week high temperatures in the 50s overnight lows in the mid 40s for the Cascade passes snow levels are relatively high this week so we're going to be tracking a mix Sunday into Monday but for the most part we're not going to be having issues across those mountain passes and for Eugene and cor Val temperature is kind of consistent today's probably going to be the warmest day of the week Jen and then as we head towards next week we'll see some drier conditions welcome to the morning show thank you I'm excited send the emails in she's doing a great job thank you well I'm excited for Thursday and Friday now yeah mostly sunny Sky it's almost unheard of you're from the Northwest you're from the Portland area right it's almost un of to get uh completely sunny skies this time of year and by Thursday Friday get outside me get my my tan on I'm a little pasty white right

Alberto Gomez, the CEO of the program, ...", "video_transcript": "look over the last 10 years we have seen San Antonio grow by Leaps and Bounds it's grown by more than 20% that means more businesses more jobs more opportunities but with this growth comes a big question how do we better connect the younger generation with these immense opportunities well better Futures Institute it's a local nonprofit co-founded by two successful entrepreneurs and it's dedicated to Preparing our young folks to the evolving job market and all the challenges that come with growing cities they also provide paid internships and fellowships really could be generational changes for so many families watching today it's important so joining us in today's leading essay segment is bethl Gomez the CEO of better Futures Institute good morning bethl thank you so much for making time for us good morning Max good morning Sarah thank you for having me so right off the bat for people who don't know other than the little intro we gave what is better Futures Institute thank you Max yeah I think you started you know a great way the job market landscape is changing at a very fast pace due to the advancement of Technology now we hear AI apps like chat GPT are forcing many of us to keep learning new tools and new ways to do our work now this is true for those in the service industry and Technical professions there is a big need for upskilling and reskilling uh or work and also in the next decade San Antonio's population will be over 2 million people this will stray even further both the job market and the sustainability of our cities now the future of jobs and sustainability of cities these are problems that we are obsessed with these are problems that we are tackling headon and to address this we are launching the better Futures Institute it's a nonprofit organization to promote a culture of innovation and Civic engagement by creating opportunities for young leaders to learn the new skills needed to succeed in their professional life but also to drive the sustainable resilient cities of the future our stem program which is our Premier um program that we are launching is focused on three areas the first one is Civic technology which is using Innovation and technology for social impact think of the 311 mobile application a product that we develop that is in use by the city of San Antonio where with an app on your phone you can snap a photo send a service request and take an active role in improving your community now this program this project is a multi-disciplinary approach using uh disciplines as data science software development um and other disciplines that um we use to learn about how how can we improve our city from a perspective of Civic engagement in sustainability infrastructure and quality of life the outcomes of this work are reports and briefs to inform decision makers ERS about opportunities to improve San Antonio one thing that I find really interesting and that I'm super excited is The Mentor Network which has a stellar Stellar lineup that we have for our program which includes the research head of Snapchat which is a very popular mobile application um we also have the stem director for NASA and former hot secretary and former mayor Henry ciso SOS among others so bethl you've talked about these op you know these opportunities the mentorship programs but why are they so crucially important to this Young Generation that's a great question uh Sarah and that is because as I mentioned right now technology it's really uh changing transforming the way we do our work and this is only going to accelerate technology is automating a lot of the things that we are learning in school and so to really stay on top uh and up toate on your profession you have to be updating continuously and so to do that uh in our nonprofit and our program we are having that as part of our coursework we are teaching uh participants not only to use uh and learn about technology that is being um implemented right now but what's coming ahead so that you can be proactive in learning uh the skills for tomorrow and speaking of the skills of tomorrow look we've seen San Antonio grow exponentially over the last 10 years we've seen more businesses come here we've seen such a huge Market increase for High-Tech jobs but still here in San Antonio there's so many people who fall below the poverty line you know how do you guys address that issue and really make the generational changes that so many our families who are watching right now are trying to make that's right right and to answer your question look our offices are actually based out of the West Side we are the first um nonprofit focus on technology out of the wests side because our mission is to provide opportunities to uner communities um look I'm from Brownsville Texas I'm from the re uh from the RGB and for me making the journey to get to San Antonio and have the opportunities that have allowed me to build my company is something that I want to recreate for other um you know Latinos like me who other Latinos who want to have an impact and improve their community and in the process yes create generational wealth so that's this is why we are focusing on stem education for underserved communities and hey we're taking a step forward and doing all of this from the website in San Antonio so that we can get close uh and collaborate with other organizations to have impact in our community yeah the cycle of poverty in San Antonio it's hard to get out of so this is great opportunity for those younger Generations so last thing before we go what does the future of San Antonio look like well the future of San Antonio is exciting and it's exciting because there's a lot to be done yes you've mentioned we have challenges like any other cities but the history is in our side and we have everything we need to thrive while creating a resilient inclusive and sustainable City we have a lot of young people and there's a lot of opportunities but we have to advance and create more opportunities for them to to get ready to learn the skills that are going to give them their opportunities to have impact and like you said get out of that poverty cycle all right PTO Gomez thank you so much for spending your morning with us today and for anyone out there who wants to learn

immigration because of the predicament of undocumented people there's been a lot of heated debate and conversation about how to find a comprehensive solution that addresses their legal status and acknowledges the contributions they have made to society in spite of this the dignity project has developed as a promising attempt to bring immigration reform to the nearly 11 million undoc dou umented immigrants living in the country it is being led by Congressional members such as Maria Alvira Salazar and it has emerged within the difficulties of politics and various perspectives this project aims to overcome the challenges identify common ground and provide these individuals with a dignified path towards legal status in order to better serve their needs in this video we will discuss the current state of the dignity project the various viewpoints regarding it and the possible influence it could have on the lives of millions of undoc ented immigrants therefore you must pay attention and watch the film all the way through in order to obtain all of the information the dignity project is an immigration reform project that aims to solve the status of the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States today we would like to review the progress that has been made with regard to the dignity project the current status of the project will be investigated by us the efforts that members of Congress such as AIA Salazar have undertaken in addition to the probable practicality of this reform it is essential to ask if this endeavor will result in tangible action or whether it will only remain another suggestion that merely Garners superficial attention without making any real progress in the arena of politics we have frequently witnessed pledges and suggestions that do not materialize into workable Solutions the problem of immigration has been debated for a very long time but concrete action on the matter has been difficult to come by Maria Alvira Salazar a notable Champion for the dignity project has underlined that this is not merely a political activity but rather a proposal for the country as a whole in her statements it is of the utmost importance that the undertaking not become involved in any political maneuvering exorcising people's emotions and selling ideas for the sake of winning support Salazar has emphasized this in several media venues emphasizing her commitment to a fair and necessary solution to the issues the country faces with regard to immigration there is reason to assume that Salazar's motives are honest and that she sincerely desires a comprehensive answer to the immigration issue this is especially true in terms of legalizing the status of individuals who have already established their lives in the United States the purpose of the project is to create a pathway to legal status for those who have made substantial contributions to the country and who have demonstrated moral solvability via their dedication adherence to the law economic contributions and family contributions the project also intends to provide a road to legal status for individuals who have made important contributions to the country these people who have not committed any crimes and do not represent any danger to the country should be given legal status since they are deserving of it Beyond merely offering legal status Salazar goes far further she suggests that people be placed on probation for a period of 5 years during which time they can demonstrate their loyalty to the nation after this period of time had passed they would be given the chance to submit an application for permanent residency this approach guarantees that the immigration process is both respectable and orderly and it gives those who are eligible the opportunity to contribute legally to the country however it is vital to take into consideration the repercussions that this reform would have on a wider scale will the country as a whole be better off as a result of this these people would be able to contribute to the country's economy by working paying taxes and receiving legal status which would allow them to do so they would offer vital resources both financial and human which would help to improve demography as well as the labor force in addition to this legalizing immigration would solve the problem of a lack of available labor that the United States is currently experiencing in the most recent weeks the initiative has made great breakthroughs and substantial progress has been achieved toward the goal of enacting comprehensive immigration reform in the weeks to come we expect to see new breakthroughs that will provide us with additional insight into the Project's potential potential outcomes it is of the utmost importance that the lens through which we examine this proposition continue to be open it is necessary for us to take into account both the potential benefits and the potential repercussions for the entire nation for this effort to be successful political support is absolutely necessary it is of the utmost importance to locate lawmakers who acknowledge the Priceless contributions that immigrants with legal status may make to the nation the economy of the nation will not suffer any damage or be destroyed as a result of this endeavor it is about making the most of the opportunities presented by giving legal status to people who have earned it even though there are still obstacles to overcome such as providing work permits to people who are already in the country there is still reason to have hoped that the dignity project will result in forward movement it is vital that political biases be eliminated and instead this subject should be approached with empathy if we take these steps we will be able to reach a consensus that is in the nation's best interest a substantial Advance has been made in resolving the immigration dilemma that has been plaguing the United States thanks to the dignity project spearheaded by hardworking members of Congress and Advocates such as Maria Al Vera Salazar the goal of this endeavor is to develop a solution that is both Humane and comprehensive for the millions of undocumented immigrants who are currently residing in the country it is essential to approach this matter with open minds and realize the enormous potential and contributions of these individuals despite the fact that we will be faced with obstacles and arguments in the future Congress has the chance to construct a fair and just system that upholds the ideals of compassion dignity and inclusivity for all individuals by furthering the dignity project and working towards immigration reform it is our common responsibility to support and argue for the rights of these undocumented immigrants as we continue along the path toward immigration reform in conclusion the dignity project is an important step towards resolving the immigration dilemma that has been

welcome to Cheyenne we hope to earn y'all subscription so guys we've got a goal for subscribers tonight we're trying to hit 3,000 subscribers last I've looked we only needed 34 34 new people to hit 3,000 which is [Music] amazing never in a million years but I think we'd hit 3,000 I would have bet against it cuz I was thinking to myself one night Fubar and I said yes foar what you're doing is crazy thank you I told myself yes it is then I said your channel will never take off I told myself yeah probably not but I'll make some new friends and have some company when we're out storm chi6 25 dispatch when we're out scammer chasing so I told I told myself I said yeah you probably never even hit a th000 subscribers D's Boutique there's a young child on 911 saying that someone stole from the store and another child in the background yelling they dead H up when has to put on on the phone so but yet here we are on the verge of hitting 3,000 subscribers hold to hey babes how you doing suan in Texas [Music] girls doc thank you for reminding me yes Moody's Rock stop guys they have donated food to the channel to give to the homeless uh for those that are new here usually in between calls we're out looking for uh people that are homeless uh I do have bags of food with me uh Moody's Rock stop has been a huge contributor to helping the homeless out here also they are doing a uh toy drive for Toys for Tots uh they are asking it must be a new gift unwrapped so they are looking for new toys uh still on the box they do have uh boxes there that you can drop off your donations for those that don't know who Moody's Rock stop is uh Ivan Moody the lead singer of Five Finger Death Punch he owns the store but they have been a huge supporter of this Channel and no it's not a paid commercial for them I shout them out just because of all all that they have done there are a bunch of great people over there Reginal 154 with a patient report [Music] do go ahead we're coming in non emerant with a 44 year old female by she complaint of having body aches um she does have a history of multiple sclerosis um greated about an eight out of 10 for the pain uh is a no times 4 no traumatic injuries current vital is as follows BP of 127 over 72 S2 of 99 and R air running through downtown again facility minutes any questions or orders hey dreamer rby how you doing guys sorry if I don't see your chats while I'm driving probably with W 2 County 71 316 serving a lot switching lanes and Crossing into the other lanes of travel yeah sorry if I don't see you guys uh y'all's messages while I'm driving I do gotta kind of keep my eyes on the road I do catch comments here there and so for those that are new here what we're listening to on the scanner is we are listening to Chen PD we are listening to larer County Sheriff's Office uh BMS and fire and also the flight for life so we do listen to all that on the scanner uh some oh and Highway Patrol just kind of the heads up that Highway Patrol if they're pulling people over up on the highway I am not able to uh I'm not able to pull over on the highways and the highway patrol gets real TR patol vehicle I did uh Highway patol get real picture Daniel Tucker how you doing so again guys welcome to Cheyenne you guys are new here I so we're kind of listening the scanner seeing what's going on RP still in contact also in check please keep try to keep it pg3 continu on but it was Head East on College uh also there are certain calls we do not run on uh we do not run on Mental Health calls unless it's a direct threat to the public uh we do not run on calls with miners unless it's a direct threat to the public and we do not run on medical calls at all are but yeah as for the Wyoming highway patrol uh they will ticket me if I pull over on the highway to film cuz there is theoretically no public access on the highways like a sidewalk those lanes that are all the way to the right are considered emergency lanes and part of the highway so real quickly guys I just wanted to show you Moody's Rock stop Ivan Moody has done so much for Cheyenne it is just unbelievable huh oh they're closed early oh but that's Moody it says Saturday and Sunday closed at 8 but yeah it looks like they're closed early there must not have been a lot going on tonight so they're just a little corner store mom and pop store hey Andrea [Music] Lulu hey tte tell that very much could be uh I know Moody's does support the veterans 1,000% he's actually got Awards up in his store uh for uh helping out uh veterans in need and disabled vets so that very well could be they could be closed [Music] today 47 call 47 we out with that light Nissan at the Maverick on South C you need a cover thank you well they caught that guy driving a rad he's up the Maverick on South gy we are way out of position and they're not asking for back for cover unit so they're probably just going to ask him dude what the hell is wrong with you so for those that are new here we are a small town hence the small channel uh if you're expecting act just constant action like they've got in California and Bakersfield or Bakersfield La stuff like that uh we don't normally get that busy Cheyenne's only got a population of 65,000 people but we are the biggest city in all of Wyoming [Music] for so folks I do invite you to jump into chat say hello we have an awesome chat come be a part of the family I think that's what separates my channels my channel from others is we have just got a great great chat well guys I run on a lot of stuff we do run on a lot of pullovers the reason we run on pullovers is because that is where we find the DUIs and the drug busts a lot of times uh I do not run on miners that should be kind of self-explanatory uh the only time I run on miners is if it is a direct threat to the public so that's really the only time I run on miners mental health calls unless it's like a standoff situation or something I don't run on mental Health calls they're having a rough enough [Music] time uh than to have me sticking a camera in their face and making their personal life business or making their personal life public and then I do not run on medical calls and that's kind of self-explanatory as well if you get hurt or you're sick or whatever you don't want somebody sitting there with a camera but pretty much everything else is fair gam so fire shootings uh fire shootings uh car accidents uh pullovers stuff like that we do run on besty thank you for gifting five membership and congratulations to all of our new members so I really do hope turn you all subscription Street Capital Billy I bet you would so right now we're kind of uh been taking a tour of Cheyenne 47 so we do pull over and Stage up uh I know it's kind of boring but it does give me a chance to interact with everybody in chat I really do appreciate all of my subscribers to my channel and I do like uh talking with yall so when we pull over and Stage up feel free to ask me question and I answer him to the best that I can three copy copy thank you so also I am not law enforcement or a first responder of any type I do want to get that out I'm I am what they'd call a Stringer or an independent uh video journalist engine 6 Ms 54 medical alert at 7230 Bridal Drive 7230 Bridal drive it's going to be a non-emergent medical call on an alarm for a 78y old female re corre 78y old male requesting a list assist there is door code information in the call time out 19s unlike other stringers in other cities uh what a Stringer usually does is sells his video to the news agencies uh unfortunately Wyoming they do not buy video they won't even accept it for free so more or less what we do is we work for donations Al [Music] ass so we'll pull over here talk a little bit hey Nico how you doing stylum biker how how you doing so guys that humming I'm sorry if it's driving you crazy in the background but it's cooling fans uh the electronics in here do get very

November 12, 2023", "video_description": "Greg Groogan and this week's panel, Bill King, Wayne Dolcefino, Tomaro Bell, Chris Tritico, and Charles Blain talk about ...", "video_transcript": "And then there were two in the battle to be Houston's next leader, John Whitmire and Sheila Jackson Lee. Move past the pack to a winner take all mayoral runoff. A major new development in the Harris County bid rigging scandal with Texas Rangers serving warrants in pursuit of proof Judge Lina Hidalgo was involved in the scheme. And down at city Hall, Mayor Turner defending his legacy, claiming those predicting future financial shortfalls have got it all wrong. I'm Greg Grogan, and welcome to watch your Point, where our panelists call it like they see it. Let's greet them. Starting us off Award winning Houston investigator Wayne Dolcefino. Next up, Fox 26 legal analyst Chris Tritico in the three spot, longtime super neighborhood leader. Tomorrow Bell Batting cleanup. Charles Blaine, founder of Urban reform and closing us out. Well known businessman and columnist for Real Clear Politics, Bill King. Let's begin there are people that like the status quo. There are people that like the condition that we're living in. It gives them power. They get to look out for their friends. Well, the message is we're going to have ethics. Under John Whitmire. We're going to eliminate conflicts of interest. Let me stand up and say right now I am my own person. I'll be my own mayor. I will fight for this city. As expected, on Election Day, state Senator John Whitmire and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee dispensed with the rest of the field with each earning a spot in a head to head. December 9th runoff to be Houston's next mayor. John Whitmire was the top vote getter, drawing nearly 43% of ballots cast seven points more than Jackson Lee, battling high negative as the congresswoman wasted little time in her bid to close the gap by announcing a high profile endorsement. She shares my vision on where this city is and where this city should be going. Mayor Sylvester Turner's nod to Jackson Lee was also expected. And frankly, cuts both ways. Panel, do you think that shared vision will be viewed by runoff voters as more of the same at Houston City Hall? I'm going to throw that question to you, Bill King. You know, I've never think I've never thought that endorsements make a lot of difference in my race with Sylvester in 2015. He had every previous living mayor endorsed him in that race. The president of the United States endorsed him in that race. And I still came in with a couple thousand votes of winning that election. So I don't think endorsements really make all that much difference in these races. This race is really a question of there just not being enough left over for Sheila between the two of them, they got 78% of the vote. So that's only 22% of the vote. Assuming those people come back, she's got to win two thirds of those. And the last poll we had said 57% of those people said they would never consider voting for. So unless there's some kind of real change in the turnout model, I don't think it's going to be close. Yeah, turnout is the key here because this is going to be on a Saturday in December. There is there enough voters out there for Sheila to turn the tide here? Absolutely Sheila got an A in the race five months ago. Her competitor got in there over two years ago and she made the runoff. I remember sitting at this table when people said she didn't have any chance because she was getting in too late. Let me tell you, she absolutely can't. In Chicago, the current mayor was 20 points behind and they said the exact same thing. It is no way. And he's the mayor and as far as endorsements, not counting wrong, I could be wrong, but I don't think I am. He got all those endorsements and he became the mayor. I'm just saying. All right, Wayne Dolcefino, you covered many mayoral races in this town. And how do you handicap this one? Well, I'm a big fan, as you know, of both Sylvester Turner and Sheila Jackson Lee. And if you want more of the same and you like that, like smelly Pappas airport deal thing that happened a few months ago, if you like that kind of stuff, then you're going to vote for Sheila Jackson Lee. The only question I have is whether Republicans come back out okay. And I think, you know, perhaps they will because Sheila Jackson Lee would be a nightmare, in my view, for this city, if you like, deterioration of our streets and if you like crime, then vote for Sheila. The one thing other thing I'll say is that I just was really happy to see Whitmire's last commercial be about streets and crime and flooding because all we've heard for months from Sheila Jackson Lee is about abortion, which the mayor has nothing to do with. And MAGA extremists like he somehow like a MAGA extremist that for me as a conservative is the most tired line there is. It's a it's a nonsense line. I care about who's going to make my city better. That's it. All right. Chris Tritico, these two finalists have almost a century of public service between them. You've watched it. You've had a front row seat. How do you see this race? So I actually am a big fan of both Sheila Jackson Lee and Whitmire, really, as opposed to my neighbor here, having worked with with Sheila on several cases, when she called me and said, I'm going to help you, and she does. And she works very, very hard. And John Whitmire, I've known for a very long time the offices down the street from me. And so both of them are very, very good public servants and they work very hard for their districts. And so either one of them, I think would be good in the job. Now, the problem I think that Sheila has is, is the numbers and I don't know that she has the time to close the gap here. The poll that that that I thought that was the most significant was the negative number of people that said they would never vote for Sheila. And I don't know if she has time with a short runoff to close that negative number. And that's, I think, the biggest problem that she has right now. All right, Charles Blain, you talk to folks on both sides of the aisle, but you have a lot of friends who happen to be more conservative. Will they come out and choose between two folks who have spent their life in the Democratic Party in a nonpartisan race, so to speak? Will they They see a clear choice here? Well, I think I mean, I think it goes to a lot of stuff we spoke about for the past couple of weeks about crime and public safety, but particularly with District in a runoff, it's going to generate more support for I mean, more conservatives coming out. But I'm going to slightly push back against something Wayne said, which is that, you know, a lot of people don't like the way the city is going. The same poll that Bill referenced said that 77% of Democrats are happy with the direction of the city. 63% of black people are happy with the way the city is going. But when you look at that, where I still have questions is that I don't know how many people Turner's endorsement brings over that aren't already supporting Sheila Jackson Lee. I don't know what numbers come from that. I mean, we all assumed he was going to support her anyway, so I don't really see how him, you know, siding with her changes that calculation at all. All right. Mark Jones is polling with the hobby school shows that, look, crime is by far the biggest issue. Bill who do you think voters see as a better crime fighter? Whitmire or Sheila Jackson Lee? I John, has made that the center point of his campaign from the very beginning. Public safety was the thing he talks about every single campaign he has the long history in the Senate. Sharon Criminal justice. So I think he has the edge on that. But on Charles's point about that poll, that poll is also the first time, um, I've ever seen a poll where a majority of Houstonians said that Houston was headed in the wrong direction. It was 5149. I've never seen that before in a poll. Okay. We got to leave it there. Still to come, trouble rising for Judge Lina Hidalgo as Texas Rangers serve fresh search warrants in the bid rigging. Prosecution of her former aides and our Sunday survey, we're asking viewers if they believe Hidalgo was part of the alleged criminal conspiracy or simply being targeted for political reasons. Tell us what you think. Vote on our Web page. Fox 26 houston.com. Just click on poll at the top of the page or tell 26 using our news app. But up next, we are speaking live in the Fox 26 studio with state Senator John Whitmire, the top vote gett Well come back half a century. That's how long state Senator John Whitmire has been representing this community and its interests in the Texas legislature. Instead of continuing in Austin or just calling it a career, Whitmire is doubling down, offering his leadership and his problem solving skills to the city of Houston as its next mayor. Senator John Whitmire joins us this morning. Thanks for being here. For a content portion of the job interview. Thank you. I'm ready. All right, Senator, Simple question. Why are you the best choice? I think it's based on the ability to bring the city together, experience and what we have to do is solve our problems and I have that reputation of working in Austin for many years of getting things done. I don't have patience for kicking the can down the road. So I believe I offer a clear choice for someone that can get the job done. Senator, the top issue, as we discussed earlier, is crime reduction for everybody. Sure. And on the campaign trail, you have told the story of being a crime victim yourself. How has that formed your career and your mindset when it comes to public safety? Well, it makes me go to work each and every day to see that no Houstonian family has to beg for their life. Like I, my wife and our nine year old daughter did in 1992. To have a gun in your face and assume that you're going to get shot and then worry about your daughter and your wife is it transforms your life. I never pull in my garage at night that I don't relive that experience. So I'm very committed to seeing that no one has that experience in the first thing you have to do to solve a crime problem is admit you have one and the city continues. Leadership continues to say, Oh, we're moving in the right direction. No, we're not moving in the right direction. We have 1900 people in Harris County waiting to go to trial for murder or capital murder. Only 900 of them were in jail. So that means this morning there are 900 people on the streets of Houston waiting to go to trial for murder or capital murder. Most are out on bond and the others are fugitives. We don't know where they are. That's your repeat violent offenders that we've got to hold accountable. Senator you have read the Greater Houston Partnership LPs assessment of the city's financial condition. There are big liabilities that they've identified. And how do you attack them and how would you solve the problems there? Again, you have to admit that we have that problem and we do have a real shortfall. We do not have a $400 million surplus. We're not paying our bills is how they're doing it. They're paying firefighters with one time federal funding. So we have to admit we have a problem. You have to cut out conflict of interest, duplication, look for new resources. You have to cut out duplication, work with the county, work with the tours, the management districts. We just have to run it like you would a business. Okay. You've talked on the campaign trail about ending the so-called war with Republicans in Austin. How would you do it as mayor and what are the potential benefits of getting on the same page? Very good question. We're being harmed in Houston by the lack of relationship between city hall and the state capital. I have no apologies for working across the aisle to get things done in Austin. I will challenge, urge the other side of the aisle on some of their social issues. But when it comes to the finances and the budget, we have to work with Austin. There is no relationship between City Hall and the state capital currently with that leadership also at the county. So I am uniquely qualified to work across the aisle to get things done, bring additional money. The Harvey funding will be determined by the Land Commissioner Office. A former colleague of mine, Don Buckingham. We're already beginning a dialog to get additional resources into Houston, Harris County. It will work. Senator, you've been attacked from all sides by your opponents, yet you've decided to hold your fire against the opposition. Why? And we've got about 20s because I think city issues are so important. I know what Houston fans care about. They care about our infrastructure, our public safety, garbage pickup. That's what ought to be the topics of this discussion. You know, I haven't said one negative word about an opponent because I want to address what city of Houston citizens are concerned about. And I'm going to continue down that path. All right, Senator, thanks for joining us. We're Call. Welcome back. More important than ever, I think that's an accurate way to describe the role of controller, given the credible projection of the substantial financial shortfalls on our city's rapid approaching horizon that said, the campaign to serve as is also heading to a runoff, pitting former Harris County clerk Chris Hollins against former Harris County treasurer Orlando Sanchez. Half the city council races have also yet to be decided with the battle for District G between incumbent Marion Huffman and well-known litigator Tony Buzbee drawing lots of attention on panel. I welcome your insight on any or all of the runoffs. 27 days from now. Okay, 30s Tomorrow I was very surprised to see Leticia Plummer in a runoff, but I believe she'll do fine when it comes to the comptroller's race. I think that Chris Hollins is going to win the race. I just hope as a controller that you do your job and don't worry about what the mayor do because you ran for your own seat and you owe us. You don't owe them, whoever the mayor may be. And then again, I was hoping and praying and hopefully Melanie Miles will win as well. Mary Nan, get them, girl. Get them, girl. You going to do it? That's it. Charles 30s I'm looking at District D, I live there. Travis McGee, community activist, neighborhood leader, has dragged Councilmember Evans Shabazz into a runoff. So that's going to be an interesting one. And District G, because I think what happens there could also lend some shed some light on what might happen in March. Primaries. Take it, Chris, 30s So you can't get over this tomorrow. You get 45. Yeah, that's right. I just want to talk about the Mary Nan and Tony Busby race because if anybody thinks that Tony Busby is going to going to pay attention to a city council position and not pay attention to $100 million lawsuits, they're out of their mind. Mary Nan is the only one that needs to win that race. That's all I want to talk about. Jump in here, Wayne. So look, we need a controller that will actually be a watchdog, okay? And so the reason I like Orlando Sanchez, besides for the fact that I sort of like him, is because he's conservative. We need and I think Republicans should fight for a conservative in the comptroller's race to sort of keep some watch of watchful eye on the Dems cats that actually control the city. Wayne checks and balances is. All right. All right. Mr. King, thoughts on controller Council races. The more Orlando is identified as Republican, the less likely he is to win the race. Wayne So you know, 23% of Houstonians are Republicans at this point. Independents are almost twice the number of Republicans these days inside the city. I think Hollins has a leg up, but I was a little surprised that he didn't come closer to 50. There was a lot of talk about him winning that without a runoff. So I think that may be a real race. I assume that almost everybody that voted for Martin will vote for Orlando now. And I still think Chris has the edge. But I think it's gonna be a pretty close race. I think that in in District G, here's what people forget. Everybody thinks, oh, that's a white Republican area about 25 or 30% of the people that live in there vote in the Democratic primary. So there are a lot of Democratic voters. And by the way, the polling I looked at, they despise Busby because of the Paxton trial. So to the extent those folks come back out, they are not going to be voting for Busby in that race. I think the question in all of these is what is the drop off going to be? You know, this race is very similar to my race in 2015, About 250,000 people voted the first time around. And that race, we had about a 20% drop off in the runoff. It was higher in 2019. So I think the real question is who's going to come back out and vote in the runoff. All right, Charles, you talk to folks all the time. Do you think that people who aren't Democrats will come out and vote for what they may view as the lesser of two evils? That is a Democrat like Whitmire or a Democrat like Sheila Jackson Lee? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think particularly the Republicans in G are going to be encouraged to come out and they're going to vote for a candidate for mayor. And I think because you have a runoff in the comptroller's race, that citywide Orlando Sanchez is very, you know, in with Republican clubs. So Republicans are going to come out again. So, yeah, I do think, you know, I think Republicans are going to come out. I definitely I know way you said that about Orlando Sanchez. Okay. Because I'm like so he 15 points behind. Okay, y'all talking about somebody else. He I'm saying they're going to come out is what I'm saying. You see any path, any possible path, both of you for Sheila Jackson Lee? No, I do not. I don't I don't think. Love it. I love it. Love it, love it. Don't think that she can. You are a good friend, Tamara. I love it. But. But you know what? She is right? If she wins, this will be Chicago. We're going to leave it right there. Still ahead, for the first time in what seems like a long time, zero chaos and incompetence disrupting a Harris County e on sale during Houston. Garden centers. Half Welcome back. Refresh going after back to back election debacles. The mostly trouble free balloting and tabulation of the Harris County November 7th vote was a genuine relief for fans of the democratic process. Free of chaos and controversy. So let's give credit where credit is due to County Clerk Tanisha Hudspeth, who frankly returned sorely missed competence to electoral management after the colossal blunders of the two previous appointed administered voters, Hudspeth returned to the role is a direct result of legislation pushed through this past spring by Houston State Senator Paul Bettencourt, returning management of Harris County elections to office holders who are actually elected and beholding only to voters, not political bosses in the majority city on Commissioners Court panel. Agree or disagree? Bill King 1,000% agree. I'll tell you a quick story that I think will illustrate this. My sister Tamara here had introduced me to Nisha shortly before the election and she'd give me her cell number. So if you see any problems, please let me know. So an Election Day. A friend of mine called and said, Our poll out on the west side is down. This is the Democrats trying to screw us again. Blah, blah, blah, blah. I texted her, she texted me back immediately and said, I will check into it. 20 minutes later, the poll was up and running because she sent a tech over there and she said, I'm leaving there and make sure that it's working before he leaves. Now no lines. Nobody ran out of paper. Minimal equipment outages and the preliminary report that's filed the day after the election in the primary last year, they had 10,000 missed ballots. And this election, there were there was a discrepancy of 65 votes, which she completely explained in the explanation. This is night and day, folks. And I'm going to tell you what I've got to admit that in 2022, I voted for Stan because I didn't know her. Whatever this girl ever runs for again, she will get my vote. Okay. Tomorrow, Bill, That's my baby. Tanisha, I'm so proud of you. You all don't understand. She has been in this department for over 15 years. Experience counts. It matters. And she was so hurt even though she was not even the one over it at the fiasco. Those that continue to happen. Tanisha I'm so proud of you. And for listening. All of y'all that were complaining during early voting about the limited locations, she didn't get to pick that that was established before it was returned to her, and she will take care of that this time. But she couldn't do anything about that. I know in my neighborhood y'all were upset because we didn't have any poles, but it will be rectified. I'm so proud of you, Tanisha. All right, Wayne Dolcefino, you've been a watchdog for the democratic process. Look this is November 20th, 23, not November 2024. A much smaller election than we can expect. Are you do you still have concerns? Well, I mean, a few concerns, but I still want to go back, You know, the headlines the other day were, you know, Judge dismisses election challenges. Right. But the other headline is that the judge confirmed every thing we have been saying. Right. That the that they broke the law. I think and sometimes intentionally that this guy and that woman before him were controlled by Rodney Ellis, who's the real boss of this thing. Okay. And it's a shame that we couldn't trust the county commissioners and the county attorney, Christian Menefee, who thinks everybody who questions an election is a racist. What an idiot he is. He's the guy that protect voted these illegalities after they were exposed. He knew it, right? They lied to judges. These guys are so partizan and this process now and I agree with Bill is in much better hands. All right. Real quick. Yeah, I think commissioners court needs to bring Clark Hudspeth in front of them and thank her. I mean, unbelievable because not even we're just talking about these past two years, but go back to 2019, that mayoral runoff election. We waited all night for an all night for the results. So she exceeded any sort of expectation, even with the bar on the floor. If the bar was higher, she still would have exceeded and she only got the election a couple of months ago because the county was contesting her. We got to leave it there, folks. Well said. When we come back, Texas Rangers on the hunt for missing evidence and the Harris County bid rigging scandal. And inn's morns We're not scared. We care about Harris County and we're not going to let a thug run her office in this way. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo lashing out at district attorney and fellow Democrat Kim Ogg after Texas Rangers were granted five additional search warrants in pursuit of evidence connected to the ongoing bid rigging. Prosecute addition of three former Hidalgo aides, including her chief of staff and his affidavit, Ranger Darren Parker, said there's probable cause. The indicted trio and potentially Hidalgo concealed communications from law enforcement regarding the $11 Million Covid relief contract steered to a little known one person firm. Apparently investigators are certain communications were not turned over because wait for it, they already have them. Courtesy of Felicity Perea, the unindicted benefactor of the alleged bid rigging. Despite deeply incriminating evidence that confidential information was illegally shared and the competitive bidding process corrupted, Judge Hidalgo insists she's the victim here. The interest here is not truth. It's not justice. It's politics. And so, you know, I got to go up because I've got a really exciting lunch today. And All right, panel, as explanation for the missing communications, Hidalgo claimed, and I quote, They asked for a trillion documents. All right, Chris, is that a good is that a good alibi? No, that was that was a really poor answer. The reason why we tell our clients not to talk to the media when they're under investigation, look, this these warrants, there was five of them, I think all of them with largely the same affidavit. But the affidavits are clear that they're going after the Lina Hidalgo and probably several others in her office and others maybe maybe others involved. And what they're looking for on these phones that they seized is evidence that may still be on the phones, but more precisely, evidence that was deleted from the phones right. They already have the evidence. Yes. Now they want to see what they deleted off the phones. And what we what we I say we euphemistically, others who are a lot smarter than me can do with these with our cell phones now, is pull evidence off the phones that you think you deleted. But is still somewhere in the recesses of the phones. And once they pull that off, now we have that evidence recreated and there it is. And you deleted it, but you didn't. And now we've got you obstruction. An I think is the term. Yeah close to it. That's a nice way to say we've got you. All right. All right. Tomorrow, your take on this, the fact that she would have a press conference and say that Kim Ogg leaked this, when everybody knows that if the Texas Rangers come out with something, it's public information. But to say that Kim Ogg is doing the investigation, the Texas Rangers, who do not work for Kim Ogg, is doing the investigation. Now, I don't know what Whatrillion documents look like to you, but I can assure you in Enron, it was a multiple trillions and they still had to turn over every tissue paper, every bubblegum wrapper and everything else. And y'all will have to do the same. Okay Our Sunday survey, 96% of those responding say Lina Hidalgo was involved. Wayne 30s Yeah, I think she's done. You know, the New York mayor, the FBI grabbed his device the other day. That's because in the last several months, including like last month, even WhatsApp, now they can go into those devices and they can get those WhatsApp messages, which is are highly encrypted app. One more thing Lina Hidalgo said last year. Do your question that she didn't use WhatsApp or an encrypted app. She bald-faced lied and we proved it later. Right Lina Hidalgo is in deep trouble and I don't think the therapy is going to help her get out of it. You agree? Bill King? She really is just lying. I mean, blatantly lying about things. You know, she said in the press conference that you were misread presenting that University of Texas won the bid. You know, in the affidavit, they scored 46. She's Felicity scored a 42. She said she didn't know the girl. She's she's calling her by her first name. And all of these text messages back and forth with her chief of staff. You know, the ironic thing about this, the more I listen to her, the more she sounds like Donald Trump to me. Yeah look, I mean, just in basic numbers, they killed UT health science a bid at 7 million and gave it to this girl for 11 million. That's not. Charles, your thoughts in her original bid was 19 million. Then they went back and let her lower the price without talking to anybody else. Yeah, I mean, listen, it doesn't look good. I'm holding my breath, though, because, listen, we've seen investigations into Ellis over the art stuff. We've seen investigations into the housing department. Nothing ever came of it. So I'm holding my breath until we see more. But it does not look good for her. And the lies that keep coming out don't look good for her. And I'll also add that as millennials, you should know that you can't just delete something from your phone and have it get out of the cloud. We're not boomers. We should know better than that. Hey, Chris, I don't know if you got to see that press conference, but Hidalgo was talking about Sean Teare and his candidacy. Is that illegal to be on County county grounds, kind of politicking? Yes, it is. And absolutely is. And I will say, one of the things she also said that that Kim Ogg released the search warrants illegally once the warrants are served, they become public records. They're filed among the papers of the court. I broke the story. I got them off the website. All right. Okay. Still to come, frustrated by President Biden's failure to secure the border, the Texas legislature now poised to pass a Show me your papers law. But up next, Houston's outgoing mayor defending his performance amid forecasts of looming deficits and potential cit ? I have not been perfect, but when it comes to the final management of this city, we have done extremely well. Mayor Sylvester Sylvester Turner pushing back hard against reports he will leave the city of Houston and precarious financial condition. That criticism has come from both outgoing city Comptroller Chris Brown and the Greater Houston Partnership, which both report the end of federal pandemic relief funding and believe and unaddressed liabilities will present major challenges for Turner's successor. The mayor also warned that operating with a budget that's structurally balance out without additional revenue will come at a steep price. You are going to cut police fire and municipal workers and when you cut employees in this city, you cut services panel. The mayor suggested critics are trying to right his legacy before he's even left office. Bill King, is it a legacy or just the record? Look, you know what? The greater Houston partnership said is nothing new to Chris Brown has said it for eight years. Will Jones is own chief financial officer, has been saying we're running an a structurally unbalanced budget for the entire time he's been in that position. This is nothing new, folks. The only reason we didn't hit a wall is because in the last two years, get this and the last two years we have received. $4 billion from the federal government, primarily in all kinds of relief packages. That's the only reason that the city has this $400 Million surplus right now. It's a little bit alarming to me that after getting $4 Billion, all you have left is $400 Million. But that's another topic. But here's the thing. They keep talking about. We're going to have to cut stuff because or get new revenue. The city's revenue is up dramatically for the last decade. Property taxes are up. One, Water rates have doubled in the last 2 or 3 years. The city's revenues are up dramatically. Yeah, we need to cut some, but instead of police and fire, why don't we start talking about cutting turves and stop sending $1 billion to Metro? That is 40% fewer riders than it had you know, two decades ago. There's a lot of things can be cut down there, but they always bring up police and fire because that scares people. There's plenty of other things down there to cut, folks. I promise you. All right, Charles, you watch City hall closely. Yeah, I mean, I agree with everything, Bill said. And the mayor always points out that he's had seven federally declared disasters. Well, with that came seven federally declared relief funds, and he's been able to use that ever since. And if you remove those funds and the costs incurred from those disasters, we still wouldn't be on a good fiscal footing. So to argue that this is better than ever and we're in the greatest position is just untrue and it's for the next mayor to figure out. And that's why we need to start asking candidates for both mayor and council what the future's going to be because this mayor is going to leave it behind for the rest of us. I got to give Wayne 20s 30s 20s Bill is absolutely right. All the money goes to the rich folks, not the poor folk. And that needs to stop. Metro I said years ago that the Uptown thing was the biggest waste of money. I was there a bunch of rich folks just trying to get taxpayers to pay for their water and sewer improvements and stuff. So I got to tell you, we've been hiding the ball this mayor has for years playing games, right? So it wasn't on his watch. He screwed over the firefighters to. All right. Real quick, I mean, I've got to go to break. Okay Can I talk about it after the break? Yeah. Okay. Up next, forging consensus on the deeply divisive issue of abortion of all places. A path presented at this week's Republican comes to cash, the choice. If you don't believe that people get pulled over for broken tail lights, according to you, it doesn't happen. That's what you said. It does not happen. I wish you were black and I wish you were brown so you would know that it happened. Sir it's happening. The four special legislative session of 2023 will likely produce a Show me your papers Law authorized in all 80,000 Texas peace officers to arrest individuals without documentation and remove them to the border panel. Is this a necessary policy or just a cry for help? I'm going to start with you, Chris Tritico. That that that's unconstitutional is what it is. And that bill will get state aid as soon as it's signed by the governor and hopefully overturned. It's just unconstitutional to pull people over because of the color of their skin and ask for them to prove their citizenship, period. All right, Wayne. Well well, okay. Constitution aside for the moment. Yeah Forbid that. Why should we worry about the cost for justice? Look, I met with homeland security guys the other day that are investigating public corruption up in that colonia up near Liberty in Splendora, the police department says that every body they pull over pretty much doesn't have a driver's license, doesn't have insurance. Right. We simply cannot afford this nightmare to continue. I always say this. We got enough of our own criminals in port and more criminals or terrorists or whatever the hell they are. I, I am done with it. And I think it is about time that we enforce this, the law in this country and that is not with everybody, but at least with the criminals to say, get the hell out. I called it a cry for help. Let me tell you this, as somebody who was pulled over in Timpson, Garrison in that area, driving a Ford Taurus at five in the morning with my two year old and my six year old back and my husband asleep. And when I'm pulled over, the guy and I'm looking at the guy and I just nod and he pulls me over and he said, Oh, you look sleep when you drive by, empty your truck and empty your truck. I want to look in your trunk. And I'm like, Why did you pull me over? And then you call the drug people before I can even make a move. And I say, I'm calling my sister. And he said, Who the hell is your sister? I said, Sheila Jackson Lee, Bob Hand goes over Badge boys, stand down, Stand down. I slap his hand out the way he talked about, You better get your black. You know what out of here. You going to tell me people don't pull people over for color? That's because your white brother ain't never been pulled over. Oh, I've been pulled over a lot. But that was because you were drunk. You should have been. Oh all right, Bill. Cry for help. Yeah Look, you know, our colleague Bob Price, who is tough on border enforcement as anybody is and really knows this issue, said that this is mostly theatrics because it's just not going to work in the real world. Look, if somebody gets pulled over for not having a driver's license or not having insurance, then we enforce that law. We don't Then try to go figure out if they're in the country legally or not, because, frankly, that is a complicated issue. I mean, you know, are we going to turn every police officer on the beat into an immigration lawyer to find out, are they here because of an extended visa or did they overstay the visa? Did they come as part of a of an asylum claim? I mean, there is no way police officers can enforce this law. Wayne wants to respond. We're going to do it later. You're up next. Breaking the gridlock over school choice. Will the unholy alliance of Democrats and rural Republicans crumble or. On tonight's edition of Texas, the issue is airing right here on Fox 26 at 945. We talk with a lawmaker in the Texas House fighting to block school choice in the Lone Star State. Say this We have wasted the better part of a year talking about vouchers. And I'm done. We need to start talking about what we do for 5.4 million school kids currently in our public schools who are desperate need of investment in their education. All right, Chris Tritico, you have fought on behalf of school districts and teachers unions. What's your take on school choice? School choice does nothing to improve education. All it does is it is it takes tax dollars and allows people who already have their children in private school and take some tax dollars from public school and let those people defray the cost that they're using, that they're already spending. And deprive children in left in public school, have less money. That's all it does. That debate will continue on overtime tomorrow. Bell wanted to talk about city finances. Exactly. You got one minute accountant on the on the on the on the panel. It's funny how y'all kept talking about is the federal money the federal money, the federal money for you all who will be voting in this upcoming election. Let me tell you, the federal representative who brought most of that money to here and because of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that allows something that has never happened before in the past, and that is for 60% to go to the to the state and the other 40, any governmental agency can bring it and help the city get better. And I'm going to tell you, Sheila Jackson Lee is that person. There are people who say that perhaps she should stay where she's most effective. Right They're delivering voting in that district. That ain't what we say, right. Right. Right Wayne speechless. I rare I really am. I will just say that I think most no offense tomorrow to tell about the Darrell Jordan thing most sane people will vote for John Whitmire most of them because they want the city to actually fix stuff that are city problems. Sheila Jackson Lee's been talking about abortion and MAGA people and her record will just continue. What's been going on in this town, which is the deals with the buddies and the friends and Whitmire does what he says he's going to do. And he's told me he will. He knows who all the crooks are. We all do. He should, because you see that golf alignment that they did out of the pension for his friend to get money for that. That's what you call or somebody who gets a law passed at the legislature where you can take the bar exam without going to law school. Then after you do it, it's out for me. That was the thing. We've got overtime. Come watch us on Fox26houston.com. Thanks to this week's panel and thank you for joining us. The conversation continues on a national level next on Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream.

book, \u201cPrequel.\u201d Then, Martha ...", "video_transcript": "[Music] welcome I'm Tracy Smith and this is Here Comes the Sun a closer look at some of the people places and things we bring you every weekend on Sunday morning journalist Rachel mattow is no stranger to political drama she covers it weekly on her MSNBC program but in her book prequel an American fight against fascism she explains how today's political climate Echoes the sentiments in the US ahead of World War II she's talking with Rita braver do you think we are now seeing a Resurgence of fascism in our country I think we are seeing another iteration of the ultra right and it has a lot of the elements that are the most worrying things that you look for when you're looking at a democracy that's in trouble of yielding to authoritarianism we see violence and intruding into the political process we see the scapegoating of minorities and cons dangerous conspiracy theories about AR rise in anti-Semitism Rising anti-Semitism is an absolute red flag anti-Semitism almost always goes with the rise in fascist ideation later in the show Rachel mattow addresses how misinformation is used to attack democracy we are also seeing a new form of disinformation I mean a lot of people think of disinformation as something modern that comes to us over social media but you're telling us hey this has been around for a long time and we need to be aware of it it's another one of those key factors you look for when a democracy is really under attack is there a well-funded comprehensive disinformation assault that is designed to make people not believe their Ling eyes make people believe that there is no knowable truth make people distrust journalism expertise science from the political circus to the classic big top wringling brothers and Bar Bailey Circus is relaunching after shuttering operations in 2017 Martha tner shows us how the revamped show plans to capture the attention of 21st century audiences the most death defying acts the world has ever seen and any hearten your stomach act from the old Ringling now it's exponentially more so instead of a single Highwire the Lopez family Ringling veterans are walking three at once 25 ft up that's all coming up right here on here comes the sun in her book prequel an American fight against fascism journalist Rachel mattow examines a rarely discussed part of American History the rise of ultra right beliefs in the United States ahead of World War II a time when some sided with Nazi Germany Rita braver sat down with mattow to explore the stories of extremism from three4 of a century ago and what we should learn from them today it may be hard to Fathom that some 20,000 Americans would gather under an image of George Washington for a bone Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden in 1939 so this is just a tiny sample of what you've amassed yeah my apartment food got is a real a real mess of this stuff at this point but Rachel mow has spent the last few years sifting through a ream of sobering stories for her new book prequel an American fight against fascism it's a cautionary tale about threats to democracy set in the era of World War II not only were there lots of Americans who didn't want us to fight but there was a lot of them who wanted us to fight on the other side with the na with the Nazis madow who of course hosts a show on MSNBC first explored the story in a series of podcasts focusing on surprising connections between Americans and Nazi interests the organizational diversity of people who were on that side of the calculus ahead of World War II is shocking to me some of the most unsettling stories madow tells are of a nationwide network of underground pro-nazi anti-semitic groups like one exposed by Arnold Eric seide who would become a renowned CBS news commentator Eric seide was a very young reporter when he uncovered what the silver shirts there was a group of very far-right extremists that were meeting secretly all over Minneapolis they were forming themselves into armed cells all across the country to mount a war against the Jews and to set up a Hitler style dictatorship here this little Bookshop is the California headquarters of the silver shirt movement and Friends of the new Germany and seide infiltrated this group and basically decided yes they're crazy but they're also serious and this New York Armory essentially became a Supply Depot for another anti-semitic militia the Christian front they had a captain on the inside in the 165th infantry unit that was willing to give them all this ammunition and cordite and hand grenade explosives and they used it to stockpile bombs what did they plan to do with it that is why the FBI arrested them in mid January 1940 the FBI they thought they were only about 7 days ahead of the Christian front plan to murder a bunch of congressmen to firebomb and bomb a bunch of sites in New York City that they thought would be sensitive enough that they would set off essentially a race war 18 people were charged with seditious conspiracy and theft of government property and what happened they got off either a hung jury or an acquittal for all of them the way it was received was that was a Brooklyn verdict for some Brooklyn Boys that they were seen as being sort of Hometown Heroes and being rabidly anti-semitic even violently so was seen as a form of sort of patriotic anti-communism and long before the internet became a conduit for disinformation the harmony Club where mattow and I sat down to talk figured into a Sinister attempt to demonize Jews the harmony Club is the second oldest private club in New York City it was specifically a club for Jews who were restricted from entering the other private clubs and in 1939 some unsavory characters including a former Army General claimed to a congressional committee that they learned of a plot being hatched here at the harmony club that might involve prominent Jews affiliated with the Roosevelt administration including Supreme Court Justice Felix Frank further and Treasury secretary Henry morganth house on American Activities Committee which had just started heard from a pair of witnesses who brought them a story about this place these guys came to Congress and said those Jews are plotting a takeover of the United States to destroy the United States and put the Jews in charge and we're here to blow the whistle on it and it was all fabricated completely fabricated and this conspiracy theory they hatched about this place this room was part and parcel of trying to turn Americans into feeling about the Jews the way Hitler was making Germans feel about the Jews so this address right and Hitler had plenty of tentacles in the US including right on Riverside Drive in Manhattan so George Sylvester verc lived here in a beautiful 10 room apartment he was very well off and the reason he was so well off is because he was the highest paid and most senior Nazi propaganda agent in the United States he was known for being a spy during World War I and then in the runup to World War II he's at it again actually convicted of spying V gets off on legal technicalities and goes on to run an operation directly linked to Capitol Hill they'd get Nazi propaganda into the United States they'd persuade a member of Congress or a senator to put his or her name on it insert it into the Congressional Record once it's in the Congressional Record they can send it out in bulk all over the United States madow calls out world two era Senators like Ernest lundine of Minnesota and Burton wheeler of Montana as well as House member Hamilton Fish III of New York as being in cahoots with verc us indicts its top fascists and then we but when the federal government finally indict some two dozen people including George Sylvester ver and several Congressional staffers in a seditious conspiracy why are none of the members of Congress in inded good question a lot of pressure was put on the justice department by members of Congress who are implicated in this scheme and even that case SPS the trial is chaos bedum a circus the prosecution is actually presenting a pretty compelling case and S months into it the judge dies that's right the judge dies from a heart attack and after Heming and ha for a few years the justice department decides not to spend time retrying the case and the American people start to turn their attention to the war rather than to any sort of fight like this at home in 35 US cities BS headed by local gloen fearers though mad's book takes place 3/4 of a century ago there's a reason it's called prequel after all it was written in the wake of the attack on the United States capital do you think we are now seeing resurgence of fascism in our country I think we are seeing another iteration of the ultra right and it has a lot of the elements that are the most worrying things that you look for when you're looking at a democracy that's in trouble of yielding to authoritarianism we see violence intruding into the political process we see the scapegoating of minorities and cons dangerous conspiracy theories about arising anti-Semitism Rising anti-Semitism is an absolute red flag anti-Semitism almost always goes with the rise in fascist ideation and it's just something that we can't ignore there's a history here that we ought to learn from Americans before us just as smart just as resourceful just as funny just as clear-minded as any of us could ever hope to be fought those fights before us we can learn from what they did up next an exclusive excerpt from our chat with Rachel mattow something you can only see right here on CBS News streaming stay with us we need to make make sure that our democracy is strong and ways big and small as promised here's more from Rita braver and Rachel mattow you're saying here in your book that President Harry Truman hid evidence of the complicity of members of Congress of the US with the Nazis why would he do that he never explained himself I wish he had he definitely did that you don't find any records of why no and true was very aggressively criticized for it we found sheaths and sheaths of letters in the Truman Presidential Library of Americans writing to President Truman saying are you kidding John raggy ought to be attorney general and fired this guy Tom Clark can't believe you fired this what are you doing protecting these members of Congress John rgy in defiance of the hups actually starts spilling some of the information that's in this report and he ends up getting fired yes and you know John rgy is in some ways a hero but in some ways he's breaking some very important rules cuz it's now classified information it's at least secret information it's not cleared by the justice department to be public information and he never the less makes it public and that's not okay the investigative powers of the justice department are only to be used for official purposes we don't have secret police in this country we don't have secret criminal proceedings and so when Rocky decides I'm going to tell everybody anyway he really is going Rog and so you can judge him for that and it makes sense that they fired him but we can also understand his reasons for doing it we are also seeing a new form of disinformation I mean a lot of people think of disinformation as something modern that comes to us over social media but you're telling us hey this has been around for a long time and we need to be aware of it it's another one of those key factors you look for when a democracy is really under attack is there a well-funded comprehensive disinformation assault that is designed to make people not believe their liing eyes make people believe that there is no knowable truth make people distrust journalism expertise science that is a way of dislocating people from what they know is true and right so what do we need to do about that in this country as we see the rise of these kinds of elements again I think we need to learn from the lessons of History I think we do need to protect law enforcement protect the justice department from political intimidation I think we need to protect our real political system from the intrusion of violence from paramilitary groups which are illegal everywhere in the United States but we nevertheless have this proliferation of them we need to protect people who are involved in even the lowest levels of politics from physical intimidation we need to protect minorities and we need to protect the Jewish community in America from the scapegoating that we are seeing and the attacks on them we need to make sure that our democracy is strong and ways big and small we need to make sure that people feel like the way you change things in this country is by voting and by working for Poli political change not by trying to bring about some sort of violent revolution up next flying high

Hopkins so I don't know that there is a lot of logic there perhaps it's not trying to get knock him off his game when he is the only reason you have points on the board right now three field goals from Dustin Hopkins that would be stupid it would be because what I mean you're not gonna break Dustin Hopkins he's confident in himself even if he misses it it's a 60 yard or he gave it a go his career long is 58 and that's a stretch for him and he did it so maybe that's where you're going but again you want to get more points on the board and PJ Walker throwing up that Hail Mary is not the plan I'll say this you know when you're kicking a long field goal you have to drive it low okay so stefansky is probably saying drives it low there's a chance this gets blocked maybe returned or they block it and recover it and they're in field goal range with one second left whatever that is a hell of a stretch and if that's the case then take a knee on the ball because that Walker Hail Mary should have been picked and should have had a ton of room to run I mean that could have ended up just as poorly can we talk about let's see Robert or Michael which one of these is because it's more appropriate Robert we get what you mean uh that was something the only thing I can say about deshun Watson's performance in the first half is that it happened it happened that's all his career worst quarter awful that first quarter and it hasn't been I don't know what it six for 20 79 yards an interception the interception was the pick six on the second play of the game which is by the way exactly what happened week two on D-Day in Pittsburgh the worst game that I've ever seen in my life um you know Nick chub and uh and people are trying to tell me on Twitter that that's not deshun Watson's fault I get it's an incredible defensive play I get it it's an incredible defensive play you could also not throw directly into the oncoming safety Blitzer you could not do that an unblocked wide open he's he's he's been absolutely Terri that's a bad decision three best plays and I know that there's only six completions so we're you know the pool is not huge his three best plays is when he gets to the end of his drop gets rid of the football and they're five six yards down the field it allows their receivers to run right the one that set them up for that last field goal um got rid of the football quickly it just seems like every time he drops back and I know the Browns are playing with a peace meal offensive line I get it it looks like he's pressured on every play he looks confused 98% of the time he drops back yep and I and people are gonna say oh you know what he he's practiced sparingly or he played last week after not playing for four weeks and it just so happens this guy played for the Browns and that's it's not the reason I'm bringing it up Josh dos rolled into Minnesota last week no to Victory he's said one week of practice with this team he's 18 to 22 for like 240 and two touchdowns at halftime it can be done don't give me this he hasn't had a lot of time I know things I know timing matters I know that that the chemistry with receivers matters if you're an elite quarterback which this guy is supposed to be you should be able to overcome some things and we have not seen any of that and to Leroy's Point here or Leroy still in the game oh there goes my that's how fired up I am I saw ET uh it's inexplicably they're eight points uh behind the Ravens here and had they you know who knows made that field goal then you're you're Five Points by them they didn't kick it whatever but they are in the game you're one score away somehow be because even though the defense is not playing what they need to do even though the defense is not playing the way that they the brand of defense that they want that last I mean it was the it was the Cardinals but holding the Cardinals to 58 yards it's unheard of of that's in that's Insanity they're not playing that kind of Defense but they are still playing strong defense and they're having they're H they're making big plays Mike Ford's interception gave the Browns another shot on offense right there before that half that's a big time play the block field goal by Jordan Elliott that is a big time play returned by Anthony Walker they are putting the offense in positions in which they can still remain in this game the offense is just not doing what they anything there's nothing going on The Shining point is the and this is what we talked about on the Browns countdown this morning is what does the path to success look like for the Browns to win the game they had to get turnovers and so far they've gotten two they've prevented the three points from getting on the board on that block and defensively they've held a very good Ravens team to just 10 points now like we have seen right in Indianapolis like we saw in Seattle early on in games this defense has struggled Baltimore went right down the field and scored then went right down the field again kicked a field goal and all of a sudden it's you know 17 to3 in the blink of an eye and then now the defense has settled down so what we need to see in the third quarter is like we saw in the third quarter in Indianapolis and then continue to see that into the fourth quarter but you're right offensively this Browns team looks lost lost lost and you know what Al right here there is a little confusion from that offensive line there's a lot of mixup right now Dewan Jones is out jedric Wills is out this is the first week of this restructured reformatted offensive line while they're dealing with injuries but the blocking has been solid there's been moments of course but the blocking has been solid and the Run game has been able to be as solid as it can be with another again you're dealing with injured an injured running back room but Jerome Ford has held the held things down and he's done pretty well what do the Browns have rushing team total 98 total rushing yards that's pretty damn good you're down to your fourth tackle down to your fourth tackle that's pretty damn good and and I think again it's deceptive that it looks like the offensive line they've been beat a few times but it looks like the offensive line is not performing all that well because DeShaun Watson is not getting rid of the football we said that this morning with this offensive line you have to get rid of the football and maybe part of that is Watson clearly is not reading this this defense well and is not operating this offense well and we can spend an hour and a half talking about why that may be all I know is they made adjustments offensively in Seattle with PJ Walker they got rid of the football they they threw some scre have we seen a screen pass today that's their and that's their strength that is what they were really honing on that's something that they took pride in something that they knew that they could do and I don't know what it is why they've shifted away from it what it if it's the Raven's defense the looks they're giving him that make them feel like they can't but they do need to go to it and yeah and Michael gamble wants to talk about coaching and you can all day obviously and Leroy said the same thing play calling not playing to our strengths it's um it's a perfect example in this game right when when the Ravens I always go back to this when the Ravens drafted Lamar Jackson they threw everything out and Harbaugh said we're going to play to the strengths of the guy we just drafted a quarterback Okay Kevin Stans can scheme Guys open that is no question and you and I can argue about this we know he can schem guys open as good as anybody in the NFL what good is it if your quarterback can't find him and that's what do you and that's that's what I I keep going back to everyone that is on the fire stansky train and looking for the next best I'm not there I'm not there no you're not there but other people are and here's the thing where do you go from there how can you be on that train what do you think happens what do you what what do you cater your offense to if if DeShaun Watson can't perform what that it comes down to consistent execution from Deshaun it really does and like you said earlier I think the excuses have run out he has had plenty of time he needs to start stacking games where he looks like he knows what he's doing that he's comfortable that he's back he had the opportunity to build on that he seemed to find a Groove against arguably the worst team in football last week but that's a stepping stone that's that roadblock that you get over so you're prepared for this game so you come into this AFC North matchup and you know it's a game that you need to win because you already lost to him once and you think that that might be what he needs to build himself up and he's six for 20 with 79 yards and Inter so bad it's so bad and I get why this is a difficult ask today you have a offensive line that's put together with popsicle sticks and chewing gum I get it um receivers have been there they've been open and he has thrown some bad balls that ball that he threw to Cooper that back shoulder he was attempting there near the end of the first half that was eight yards out of bounds and even the analyst who I don't even know who it is today Solomon wilcott maybe is like that's just a really bad throw that's just a really bad throw and this is a guy who came in and and had been accurate early in his career I mean that's what made him so dangerous in Houston and man we haven't seen that at all save for some deep balls and yes he threw some incredible deep balls last week against Arizona this is a guy who looks confused damn there it goes he looks confused he looks lost and he doesn't look all that confident and Hanford Dixon was saying this morning it looked like he got a Swagger back a little bit last week I agree it did look like that last week that Swagger's gone that Swagger is he left it here in in Cleveland because it ain't it's not there in Baltimore all right well what do you want to see in this second half more Dustin Hopkins field goal I tweeted after the second one I said they're only four field goals away from taking a lead in this game they're only three away now so uh they got a chance gotta have more turnovers defense is gonna have to score get close damn it Cameron Gotta Get In The End Zone you gotta get in the end zone but the defense is gonna have to score I want I want some kind of consistency with deshun Watson I don't need him Point accuracy passes but give me something other than confusion and Chaos out there you might not be deshun Watson because we're doing this says the game is going

I'm Amber Frias. A new plan that some city leaders hope could tackle San Diego's housing crisis could soon become a reality. Tomorrow the San Diego City council will discuss the housing package 2.0. It's a plan from Mayor Todd Gloria. It adds incentives to develop granny flats for seniors and people with disabilities. It also proposes creating dorm style student housing near Universal stores and transit centers and it prioritizes housing over parking. The most controversial piece of the plan was denied by the city's planning commission in August, SB ten would have allowed more multifamily homes to be built on single family plots. The San Diego City Council is set to meet tomorrow morning at ten and the Israel-Hamas war has become a flashpoint on college campuses across the US. Rising tensions have led to violence or threats of violence at several universities. Even here at home. Right now, CSU is responding to a video circulating on social media. It appears to show someone ripping down posters of kidnap Israelis. Students told us they believe the debate over the war should remain civil. When I see people taking stuff down, I don't know, kind of disrespectful. >> I feel like there isn't very much like awareness and like attention that should be like brought up with like what's going on and, you know, I feel like people should be like, more respectful. >> CSU says it does not tolerate instances of harassment, discrimination or acts of violence targeting individuals based on their backgrounds. The school encourages us all to uphold their core values and principles of an inclusive community, and tensions are also running high at UC San Diego. Earlier this week, students with personal ties to the conflict told us this is not how they envisioned college. >> There was one day where I like texted my friends that are Jewish and I was like, Are you going to class today or should I just stay in my dorm? >> You can't control what you look like or who you are, but it's just when people make that the biggest difference, it's like, why? Like, are we all like , not the same. There have been at least five student led protests at UC San Diego in the past month. >> And on this, veterans Day weekend, one veteran and his family in Bonita had a celebration of a lifetime. It ended with them being handed the keys to a brand new mortgage free, smart home. NBC 7's Dana Williams shows us what makes this home so life changing every inch of this house is created with such intentionality to really improve the life of who's going to be living here. >> Even simple tasks like getting out a mug are made. So much easier. The Armenta family has been waiting more than a year for this day. >> It's very special. Morning Yeah. Wow >> This 2900 square foot house was created specifically for them. Jose Armenta is a retired Marine. He served for four years right out of high school and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011, along with his K-9 partner, Zenith. There he was part of more than 50 combat missions. >> I served with some of the toughest guys I've ever met recon Marines. And that was one of the greatest honors of my life. >> But on August 28th of that same year, he lost both of his legs. After stepping on explosives. >> Even though the war is finished now, we're still living with our injuries and we're still living with struggle. And so knowing that we have that support, it means a lot to us. >> It's been more than a decade, but even the little tasks never got easier. >> The hardest part of losing your legs is going home. And then realizing you can't do half the things you used to do in the home from extra wide hallways and doors to adapted countertops and bathrooms. Being able to cook for my kids, being able. To go outside and play with my kids, having more room around the kitchen to move. >> It's thanks to the Gary Sinise Foundation in it's the small things, right, that playtime cooking laundry and work will become so much more doable for Jose, his wife and their three kids. I'm looking forward to waking up and knowing that I have a lot less barriers in life. This is the 89th House. The foundation has created for a wounded warrior. Overwhelmed, But it's up to the mentors to make it a home. >> We're going to be able to make a lot of memories here and my kids are going to have a beautiful home to grow up into. So we're super happy. Yeah. Dana Williams Wow. It's hard to put into words NBC 7 and NBC 7 and Telemundo 20 proudly hosted our annual salute to Service Festival aboard USS Midway RV. Eddie on Navy. >> That's the Chula Vista High School Choir giving a salute to service. Our annual event is centered on gratitude for all San Diego military families. NBC 7's very own Monica Dean Sheena Parveen and Mark Mullen emceed yesterday's event and what we love most is meeting our local heroes. We spoke to Vietnam War veteran Ralph Womack. The former naval petty officer says he was 18 when he was sent on a secret mission flight over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. >> When I think about the guys I served with and I think about all the other people served in all the wars and it's very gratifying to see people remember that and recognize veterans, Mr. Womack says. >> In 1998, his secret Navy mission was declassified, and in 2006, his squadron was awarded the presidential unit. Citation. The honor is given to veterans for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy on or after December 1941. And we will have a look at your weather right after this. >> Nice looking for NBC San Diego on Roku. The easiest way to find us is with Roku. Voice commands.

NBC San Diego News on Roku. >> I'm NBC 7's Brooke Martell The Veterans Day Parade is happening downtown starting at Harbor Drive. Here's a look at those conditions. Looks great. We have temperatures above seasonal norms really across the entire county, at least for the valleys and the coastline for today. But you can see upper 70s when things kick off. We stay there going into lunchtime and even through the rest of your afternoon, hovering right around those mid to upper 70s with the potential for your max daytime high to be right around the low 80s. Here's a closer look at that your area forecast shows that downtown San Diego could be reaching 81 degrees mid 70s for imperial Beach, La jolla, Oceanside. Closer to the low 7070s for Encinitas. But a great day to hit the beach over the inland valley communities a little bit warmer. We're staying close to the low 80s. A few exceptions to this El Cajon could be a bit warmer than that, right around 87 degrees for that Max. Daytime high, mid 60s for Julian, upper 60s for Pine Valley, low 80s for Borrego Springs. Wanted to give you a preview of what we can expect for the upcoming week. Warm and dry today we have that elevated fire threat because of the model that Santa Ana wind conditions that are still in the forecast for Sunday. But you can see a low pressure system, this Pacific storm moving in from the north. It could bring some rain to San Diego for this upcoming week and really for a lot of California. Let's take a look quickly here at the preliminary rainfall amounts. These will change as we get closer to the event. But between Wednesday and Friday is when we could see the most of this rain. And in some cases, we could be between 1 to 2in, possibly for the coast and the valleys. More than that, though, for the mountains maybe up to an inch and a half, even 2.5in of rain and around a half inch of rain right now for the desert region. Again, these totals could change or estimates could change as we get closer to this event. I'll send it back over to you. >> Thanks, Rick. And take a look at this. A San Diego holiday tradition officially comes back today. The old Globe will host its opening night of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The show is back for its 26th year based on the 1957 children book by the late La Jolla. Author Dr. Seuss The Musical premiered in 1994 at a children's theater in Minneapolis. In 1998. It moved to the Old Globe, where it's been in an annual tradition ever since. Performances run through December 31st. And there's more coverage you can count on on NBC 7.com.

that we have to be concerned about even here in America and we pray for our military uh the hostages 200 plus 10 of those Americans 1,400 that died tragically on October the 7th so I'd ask you to join with me as we pray again father as um where could we go but to you at a time like this and uh our hearts literally are breaking as we think about the uh pain and suffering that's going on not just in different parts of our world but um but right here close to home we pray for those who are pushing back on the darkness there in in Israel for the safety and well-being of those soldiers those Sailors and those Airmen we pray for those hostages Lord that U that somehow they could be protected from the uh the pure evil that has that has bound them we do pray that they'll be found safe and released pray for the families of those hostages cannot even imagine the struggle that they're going through right now but we pray for them a comfort that can only come from you a peace that passes all understanding or for these right now who find themselves U walking through that Valley the shadow of death personally we pray God that you might give them a peace in their hearts and for Kathy and for

the Coast Guard we we pray for their safety for their well-being we're here and relatively safe sometimes we forget that there's a lot of folk out there who are standing between us and darkness but not today we remember and we give thanks to you for them for their families for the sacrifice for the service and we pray this in Jesus name and all God's people said amen we're going to continue the uh passage that we were looking at last Sunday in Ephesians chapter 6 and you know we started out in verse in verse 10 where it speaks about finally and then he describes putting on the whole armor of God and I I took noted the fact that as we were singing stand up stand up for Jesus the emphasis was on putting on the gospel armor last last week we were we were introduced to a phrase that sometimes can be um um not so much misunderstood but more added to it than it needs to be when think about the evil day in the evil day that's the phrase that I'm referring to and sometimes we think about that as an approaching death uh you know a life and death moment sometimes when we read that phrase We think of it in the context of U uh the last days but but in reality the phrase itself really just simply means when things are at their worst I don't know about you but as I look around the so world today and I can't think of another moment in the history of my life and perhaps and I've asked others who are older than me if they can think of another moment when life was at its worst struggles so it's in the context of that phrase that Paul admonishes the church at Ephesus to stand and to withstand the battle the enemy the war that's being waged one practical application of that is what's happening right now with regards to the Jewish people I understand that uh some struggles are happening all over the world a lot of hatred a lot of meanness in fact we we've written a point in history and if you go back and read the history particularly the the rise of of Hitler and Nazi Germany and you begin to see how some of there's there's some correlation between how that movement took place and what we see happening even today the hatred of the Jewish people and the demonizing of Israel is quite rampant today just this weekend Muslims in Sydney Australia are chanting gas gas the Jews if you're familiar with the history of the Holocaust that's how they killed a great number of the Jews nearly six million died those gas Chambers those concentration camps sadly over the last several weeks Jewish students at Elite universities in America have been afraid even to go to class and some have been frightened so much so that they were hiding in the library and having to lock the doors from from the anger misplaced anger over in Germany Jewish children just the other day were afraid to go to school because because of the animosity and the anger the evil in fact the children were told do not wear the Star of David in public because you could be attacked in Germany the British Broadcasting Network had a headline British Jews are full of fear like never seen before even in our own Congress an individual stood Rashi Talib stood with a crowd in Washington DC Enchanted from The River To The Sea and that's not an aspiration that is a admonition to destroy the state of Israel completely to annihilate she defended it but there is no defense of it in her own Congress in her own Congress hatred and yet the hatred that that we see being exemplified at this moment with regards to Israel is not a hatred that would simply stop with Jewish people it was would simply be giving permission to continue on Martin Neer back in the early days of the the movement with regards to Nazi Germany a Lutheran Pastor he was taken prisoner and put in a concentration camp himself because he defended defended the gospel he said first they came for the Communists I didn't speak up because I was not a communist and then they came for the Socialist and I didn't speak out because I was not a socialist and then they came for the trade unionist and I didn't speak out because I was not a trade unionist then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew and then they came from me and there was no one left to speak out for me we're at a very critical point an evil day I say that because uh Harvard and Harris pole a Harvard and Harris pole of just of recent recent days said that 51% of Americans age 18 to 24 believe that Hamas was justified in the barbaric attack on Israel October the 7th 2023 51% of 18 to 24 year olds Justified that brutal barbaric evil attack Jewish people in America make up only 2.4% but yet the Jewish people in America are the target of 60% of all the hate crimes toward religion evil is rampant so we are in the evil day when things are at their worst and yet the admonition of the passage of scripture is that we might stand and withstand stand with freedom liberty and justice for all why don't we want walk through the passage together and we'll come back and make more comments in verse 14 Paul says stand therefore take a stand got to speak up we need to be speaking up we need to be speaking up and speaking out stand therefore having girded your waist with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness to gird speaks of tightening up you see Warriors back during that day that Paul is writing they had the loose fitting type clothes a tunic and so so there was a belt and they would tighten that and when they went into conflict they would tighten that belt up which held their sword or their knife so that they could move freely and Loosely basically so what Paul is saying here is he is literally handcuffed chained to a Roman Centurion he said when you're in battle like this you have to tighten the belt tighten up G your waste with truth truth is we live in a day sadly where the deceiver deception is so rampant and you know deception with regards to the difference between a male and a female so to speak or or or shim or something along that line that that there's this effort on the part of many to somehow Common Core the the genders that God has ordained between male and female the truth with regards to what is marriage between a man and a woman in the eyes of God the truth of the of the fact what is life and the sanctity of life that truly life begins at conception and we hear the words of our God our God himself when he looks down and he says to with regards to Jeremiah and he said while you were in your mother's womb I knew you I knew you truth we live in an age where this AI artificial intelligence is many are busy busily rewriting the Bible I Was Made known of a book that conversations with God that's come out that hypothetical conversations with God and when it comes down to things that we know in the Bible or or explicit and plain and in writing and that object is brought up it's like God is saying well you ain't got to worry about all that you see we live in a day and time where we need to hold to the truth and understand that there is an effort on the part of darkness and evil to to change the truth to a lie deception having put on the breastplate of righteousness the breastplate is covers the neck from the neck down to the thighs all of the vital organs and so Paul is saying we're going we're going into battle we're going into battle with an enemy that that doesn't take prisoners that just soon take you in fact the devil steal kill and destroy righteousness what is Right verse 15 he says having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace those combat boots tightening up the bootstraps preparation of the Gospel it speaks to be ready to be ready with regards to the gospel of peace and the peace that he speaks of there is peace with God the greatest hope that we have the in fact the only hope that we have in this day and time is the gospel it is the hope of the world it changes the heart from the inside out verse 16 he says above all taking the Shield of Faith taking as and receiving the shield of Faith holding that in front armies coming together joining Shield to Shield pushing back on the darkness with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one I believe that what we saw on October the 7th the year 2023 was an outright movement of darkness and evil that has been set loose demonic Al within our land the wicked one throwing those darts verse 17 it says and take and and the word take there you know words have usage and when you look at that word it's like take you know take something but but in reality it's a word which simply says to receive that there's something being offered to us and that something is salvation the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God the sword of the spirit is offensive weapon Gates of Hell not Prevail against the church that's an offensive term an illustration pushing back on the darkness so in these these moments this evil day a season season I pray that this season will end quickly and that once again there would be a law in the battle that's raging but the reality is we got a ways to go and we need to be be ready when things are at their worst we need to be ready Paul says the the whole armor of God to withstand the evil day crisis demands not an inch of territory be be given up it comes to you and I as the body of Christ so the first thing that Paul says here is that we need to tighten up the belt of Truth those ancient warriors those loose-fitting clothes that they wore they would hold they would pull tight the belt of the tone that tunic there and they would be free in their movement to freely and quickly move toward pushing back on the enemy prepare for action it's exactly what Paul is saying here the word truth there is is the word the truth of the Gospel that he talks about truth without and I took note of the fact that In this passage it is truth but it's without the article the and that's that's significant because what that means is what Paul is saying here in all sincerity and truthfulness sincerely he's saying at this moment in all sincerity and truthfulness you need to tighten the belt for the battle that's raging around you truth without that article what we believe is important the devil seeks to throw our faith our belief into chaos and moral confusion he's a liar the devil's a liar efforts to debunk The Ten Commandments that we've seen Through the Ages as simply 10 suggestions Adam and Eve when they were in the garden and the devil came and he looked at Eve and said did God really say that plant that seed of deception in the wilderness when Jesus was being tempted and the devil came and tempted him tested him he said if you be the Son of God if John 14 Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life and nobody comes to the father but through me you see the closer you and I get to being and doing what God has will for us to do the more intense the battle truth the sense of the word itself speaks of Integrity it speaks of ethical and moral consistency inner integrity and stability simply put we cannot separate our private life from our holy life we are what we are what this tells us is why belief is important truth you see belief leads to Faith and Faith leads to commitment and commitment leads to a closer walk with God and a closer walk with God leads to study prayer to seek God's wisdom discernment his will about who he is and who we are in relation to him because it matters what we believe and to whom we've placed our trust everything matters put on the breastplate of righteousness he says thorax the breastplate the thorax heard to Thoracic Surgeons anybody's had open heart surgery has you see we we have our standing before God by reason of the righteousness of Jesus Christ not because we are good enough but because he was good to us his righteousness we're not perfect only by the grace of God are we saved we stand before people today by reason of his righteousness enabling us to be right with God the vital parts of the body are protected like a bulletproof vest as we Face the enemy that surrounds us so to speak it is literally it covers our body from neck to the thigh bronze medal for the common Soldier for the officers it was the coat of male metal pieces Isaiah 59:1 17 says Yahweh he put on righteousness as his breastplate and the helmet of salvation on his head righteousness stands for the Integrity of character a reputation for fair dealings our protection is found in what Christ has done for us and in US words are no defense against accusations but a good life is we are righteous not because we're good but because he's been good to us by the way we live what we say and what we do we give witness to the presence of God in our lives in verse 15 he talks about what's been described the gospel Boots the kigga half boot they were made of leather the toes were free they were heavy studded Souls I mean they had cleats basically I remember playing Little League baseball and coming on up and I was I was so anxious to reach that point in bab Ruth where I could get a a pair of metal cleats and and I thought man I have made it to the big times cuz I had a pair of baseball cleats that were metal but then one day I was playing second base and a guy slid into me with metal cleats and I didn't I didn't want no more metal cleats they'll leave a mark you want to see I'm no I'm really not they'll leave them Mark but the reason that they had these heavy studded Souls was because they could hold their ground to Stand Fast and to withstand they were tied at the ankle in the shin they were equipped for long marches for a solid stance to keep from sliding on slippery slopes today stand your ground stand your ground he says do you have firm footing in the faith the word preparation there speaks of equipment it speaks of Readiness it speaks of being prepared it speaks of firmness literally just simply to be ready to be ready I was talking to some some people who currently serving in our military and some of them an order had come down to be ready to move out in 24 hours if need be I me they had to go get all their equipment and look at it and have it ready at that point when that order came they would grab their equipment and they would get in and go it's kind of like our volunteer firefighters and our First Responders here that when that call comes out you have to be ready you have to be ready and we need to be ready in this evil day in which we live firm footing for all difficulties and the Readiness to announce the good news this is what he's saiding they announce the good news any and everywhere the gospel the gospel of peace do you think for a moment that there can be peace in this world without the gospel it's not going to happen the only hope we have is the gospel Isaiah 52:7 says how beautiful on the mountain are the feet of those who bring good news the gospel of peace God's power to rescue peace with God and the peace of God to live in community with him or I should say to live in communion with him the gospel is the good news and that there is savior there is a savior who died on the cross for you and I and that we can trust him as our savior and our Lord to ask him to come into our life to be our savior to say Lord I've sinned and I ask you to forgive me to cleanse me from this unrighteousness to be my savior to be my Lord that's the good news Romans 10:15 says preach the gospel of peace peace with God Jesus is a friend of sinners like us you see we are f fighting today we are fighting to rescue the perishing and as the old hymn says to care for the dying when I look at that verse he's literally saying just hold your ground dig in stand and withstand the good news of the Gospel is the only hope for today and any day and it's up to us to let the light shine we're in a spiritual battle today like no other time in history our history this is it's not a subtle discret effort on the part of Darkness it's a fullscale Invasion that's taking place literally 43% of Millennials listen to this 43% of Millennials born between 1980 and 1994 don't know don't care and don't believe that God exists 43% of Millennials don't know don't care don't believe that God exists researchers are warning that belief and behavior of younger Americans especially Millennials threatened to reshape the nation's religious parameters beyond recognition in fact this radical spiritual revolution has created a generation seeking a re-imagined world without god without the Bible and without churches George Barner well-known research researcher took it a step further he said 2third of teens and young adults agree that many religions can lead to eternal life 2/3 of teens I I I read in the book where it says Jesus the way the truth and the life nobody comes to the father but through me none the only way one way that same study found that overall younger adults are significantly more likely to embrace horoscopes as a guide Karma as a life principle to accept evolution over creation to view owning property as fostering economic Injustice as in socialism on a spiritual matters Americans younger than 55 are for more are far more likely to distrust the Bible and to believe that God is uninvolved in people's lives such as the day which we live and one in six generation Z that's between 1995 and 2012 1 in6 Generation Z also known as Zoomers identify as lgbtq one and six the highest percentage of any generation in history the day stand withstand verse 16 he talks about the shield of faith 4T tall 2 and 1/2 ft wide rectangle wood with overlay animal hides or cloth it was tongue and groove on the sides which meant that they that that the soldier next to you could hook his uh Shield next to your onto yours and that one over here and like a wall going through and pushing back on the enemy that was coming and I got to tell you if there was any moment in time when we as the body of Christ need to bring our Shields together and go forth together it's right now it's right now we need each other whenever the writer of Hebrews was saying not forsaking the assembling of thyselves together as the manner of some is but so much the more as we see the day approaching this is the day this is the day the day of evil when things are at their worst because of the devil's schemes we need to unite to confront the enemy the devil divides the fiery darts the devil don't play he uh he's wicked he's cruel you know you hear about what happened on October the 7th in Israel you hear about the the children the babies that died you hear about the men the women the young women the older women you hear about all those atrocities the there's only one explanation for what they did it was just purely demonic evil pure the devil don't play he's wicked he's cruel same people who are waving the flag of AAS whether it's in Australia or whether it's in England or whether it's in America the same ones that are waving the flag with regards to AAS are the same ones who are advocating the killing of The Unborn even up to the point of birth Shield of faith you know the the word faith there is not simply saving Faith but it's Living Faith as in trust in the promises and in the power of God as in practice for for Paul it was trustful obedience or we would sing the old hymn trust and Obey for there's no other way to be happy than to trust and Obey in Jesus so we got to work we got to fight we got to push back on the devil together United the greatest challenge today is for us to stay together stay United verse 17 the helmet of salvation again I make reference to the fact that word actually in the language got a little bit of experience with it means to receive it's not something that you take we uh several years ago I had a had a wedding over ke over over in Auburn and the couple had invited Ed all their friends to come and to bring their dogs so there was like maybe 30 dogs and about half that many humans and so in fact the best man was a Great Dane and there was a there was a guy that was holding him and I said if you think I'm going to get that ring you that's not going to happen you going to get it for me and cuz that that's a big old mouth that's looking at you like that and uh so so it it was It was kind of interesting because none of the dogs got into it thank thank goodness there was no dog fight that unfolded um so after after the wedding you know they're taking some pictures so I walk back toward the back of the Pavilion there and there's this nice table laid out I me got the most beautiful cookies you can imagine over there so uh there's a lady standing behind it so I reach out to take one of the cookies and she said I wouldn't do that if I were you honest to God and I said okay she and then she you know she came back and said well those are for the dogs the human food is up in the uh on the other side over there so I went over there and um I I received a cookie I didn't I didn't take one I didn't reach for one she looked at me and said would you like a cookie and I said yes ma'am I would and I received it so there's a difference between taking and receiving and we receive this salvation it is a free gift that God gives to to us you see the devil wants to get in our head and mess with our minds and deception in himself but God wants to give us his presence that we can push back on the darkness and he wants to remind us that salvation is costly on a Hill Called Calvary but freely he gives it to us freely he gifted us we received freely given freely received verse 17 sword of the spirit that's the holy spirit it's the word of God power and Power in this book I find myself reading the Bible but then I realize the Bible's reading me have you noticed that sometimes I think that people look at this is simply a book of history or events in time but the reality is it is the Living Word of God to each and every one of us such as the day in which we live this moment when things are at their worst and we have a word from God for this moment it's the sword the sword of the spirit the sword is an offensive weapon one that you take to the enemy when Jesus was being tempted in the wilderness and and you know the devil was saying you know eat this and jump from here and do that or bow the knee to me what was the response Jesus said it is written you shall not live by bread alone it is written now no other gods before are my Lord himself it is written that you don't tempt the Lord God by the word of God it is the powerful word of God Hebrews 4:12 says Thy word is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword the word of God gives us the ability to speak to the time in which we live it's God's Own weapon it's ready to attack it's ready to defend it's a spiritual battle it is for such a moment as this so Paul says uh Hey when things are at their worst you need to suit up from head to toe and you need to stand and withstand the forces of Darkness this morning uh somewhat early I try to get here kind of early before daylight I'm I'm sitting at top of the hill there and just reading through notes and listening to uh The Inspirations or whatever's on whatever's on Enlighten 65 serus XM so I notic this this is like before maybe about 10 minutes till 6 a truck comes pulling into the driveway it's just me and pulls in and comes up and pulls up right next to me and I recognized the individual and uh he and his wife and rolled the window down it's an old marine and he looked at me he says we just want you to know we love you and we praying for you praying for your church rolled his window back up took off same guy that when David and I were in Birmingham and I was getting the stitches out of my head we stopped at Lloyds to celebrate that right and David had gone to wash his hands and this guy intercepted him and said hey is that brother Rusty sitting up there and David did like I could I don't know what he said I could see David doing like that and that guy looks at me and and I didn't I didn't know him at the time so he comes walking deliberately over to where I'm at he said are you brother Rusty and I said yes sir he said the Lord told me to come over here and pray for you and he knelt down right there in Lloyd's restaurant and he said a prayer for me and then this morning he pulled up beside me and said hey we're praying for you I I took that as because I there was a story that I wanted to share but I didn't know exactly how to share it but at that very moment I said you know I I know it needs to be told so let me say you this April the 22nd 2008 the battle is Raging in Iraq there are two marinees so two marines Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance corporal Jordan hater H AE t r Jonathan is 20 years old Jordan is 22 years old The Outpost is as I said is in Iraq and there's a makeshift Barracks that are housing 50 Marines and there's another building right next to it that is home to 100 Iraqi police officers it's in ramdy which was on owned by Al-Qaeda it's an intense moment fighting the terrorists in ramadi Jonathan and Jordan were assigned that morning as the change took place to guard the entrance to the compound where our Marines were and where these Iraqi police officers were the the staff the sergeant has said you know you you keep anybody in everybody out don't let anybody in here and no vehicles in here so they took the their position there at the entrance to the compound they're standing guard and in a few moments a large blue truck turns down the alleyway less than a 100 yards away and speeds toward the entrance just before it got to the entrance the truck stopped because the gunfire and detonated this bomb two Marine soldiers were killed instantly Jonathan and Jordan they say that the trucks engine was that it landed 200 yards away an explosive expert estimated there were 2,000 pounds of explosives Jonathan and Jordan didn't run they stood firm they found a security camera that was on that entrance way there and that had been damaged and they retrieved the footage from it and that that recorded that very moment it took exactly 6 seconds from the truck entering the alley till it exploded six seconds 1001 100002 13 1004 1005 1,6 no time to talk just instantly react following orders stop anybody any vehicle what it showed was that they raised their weapons fixed it upon the Target and began to shoot non-stop that's the reason the truck stopped where it did because they had taken out the driver it showed two marines standing their ground who never hesitated they never stepped back they didn't go left and they didn't go right what they did was they leaned in they leaned in we we live in a day if I can put it in the context of spiritual context we don't need any left or right we don't need any running we need to stand and withstand and lean in the day in which we live here's what's at stake the honor of Our Redeemer at stake did he die in vain what's at stake the hope of humanity Christ in us the hope of glory what's at stake our own deliverance and the Deliverance of our children our grandchildren and great-grandchildren what's at stake the glory of God the reputation of our God last week the emphasis was on soldiering on this week it's stand withstand and lean in these are critical times we we have to do our best to push back on the darkness and to call out evil and light it up with the word of God amen amen let's pray father thank you thank you for your word thank you for the day in which we live the time for such a moment as this we're burdened we struggle as we think about the struggles and the heartache the pain we think about Lord this the pure out evil that we've witnessed in parts of this world God how we pray we pray for the sake of the Gospel that we'll do our best to push back on the darkness starting right here in our Jerusalem it's just like the old song says all to thee Lord all to thee so I pray we'll take to heart your word and apply it to our life and I thank you for those who by their own example in life and in death have taught us that it's no greater loveed than one who's willing to lay down their life for another and God we remember Jonathan and Jordan today and we remember those 50 marines that were were saved that day and those 100 Iraqis that were saved because two marines stood and with stood and leaned in such as the moment in which we live we must lean in for the sake of the gospel and we do pray this in the name of Jesus our savior and our Lord who when it came to that moment himself he didn't go left he didn't go right he stood and we with stod and he leaned in gave him life for each of us power of the Gospel we pray and ask in Jesus name and all God's people s amen let's stand as we sing I've heard

{"doc_id": "0pd4BWiX", "video_title": "What's No Labels' plan for 2024 election?", "video_description": "It calls itself a home for the politically homeless. The No Labels Party is wooing presidential election voters who want a choice ...", "video_transcript": "we start with no labels one year from now the self-described Centrist party's presidential candidate could play a role in deciding the 2024 election if the group nominates a presidential candidate I spoke with no labels National director Joe Cunningham late last week about the party's plans and much more Cunningham who's a former Democratic congressman from South Carolina started by describing No Labels Mission here's an edited version of our conversation well I think the numbers speak for themselves uh the majority of Americans do not like these two presumptive nominees and so for the last year plus no labels has been working to get on the ballot in all 50 states plus DC to give voters another option because I think it's very evident that folks are just unhappy with these choices we're on about a dozen states right now uh look to be on about 20 by the end of the year we're on the boutot here in Arizona and again we're fighting to give Americans the choice that they deserve so you mentioned uh no labels is on the ballot in Arizona 4 million registered voters here about 18,000 have registered with no labels that is 0.5% or so uh of registered voters is that a movement does that tell us this is working because it's not taking off well look no labels has been around for over 12 years and so when you go around the country I go around the country speaking to people more and more people know who we are and what we're doing and we've been around for a Dozen Years mainly operating within Congress you know I was when I served I was a member of the problem solvers caucus which No Labels helped start with Kon Cinema yeah yeah she was a congressman exactly yeah and Cinema moved over to the Senate side when I was coming into the house but we worked with moderates like her uh like Joe Mansion Susan Collins uh all the folks over on the Senate side who wanted to bridge that partisan divide um I was able to get two my bills through a divided Congress and signed in law by President Trump because I was working in organization and in a caucus that valued by partisanship and look I think you know where we are as a country most people are somewhere near the middle you know they're not off to majority of the country is not off to the far left or the far right uh and no labels is stepping up and given that Common Sense majority of voice because a lot of people feel either politically homeless or they feel like they're not represented uh so they should have a voice and that's what we're doing so let's talk about the questions about No No Labels uh you say voters want this choice so do donors who have helped to fund um no labels getting on the ballot who are the donors who want this no labels um again it's been around for 12 years and some of these questions that come up now I I find a little bit um interesting about the timing because we've been operating in this space for over a dozen years but now you're putting up a presidential candid the game has changed we're putting up a ticket we're not going to be running a campaign and I think you know whoever runs a campaign whether it be the Super Pac and obviously the presidential election they should abide by the the letter of the law right no labels a C4 it's a nonprofit all we're doing is securing the ballot line and we're operating like a C4 and this goes back to um a lot of people want to say who who are the donors this or that in an effort to intimidate the people that are working to try to get another option uh people have been very very vocal about that this goes back to the Supreme Court case Alabama versus the NAACP where you know the Supreme Court ruled that no you can't intimidate people and you can't you know force people to to show their roles or their members or their donors in this this realm of C4s but isn't that a fundamental piece of information you're asking voters to come along before they even got involved there's some people who they don't know whose identities they don't know who want this it's being presented as a Centrist organization right no labels how do they know this is truly a Centrist organization the people behind this are truly Centrist well take a take a look at the organization you know I'm a I'm a former Democratic congressman who serves but it does it takes money to get the organization it does take money and for for example you know harlon Crow's name has been mentioned as a donor I don't know to what extent is that accurate I I mean I can't say whether it is or it isn't again we we don't release the names of our donors but I would tell people this look at Who's involved in look who's putting their names out there whether it be Senator Joe leverman Dr Ben shavis a civil rights hero um you know again I'm a former congressman who voted to impeach Trump who voted you know to put country ahead of party uh the group was started by Nancy Jacobson uh former Finance uh uh chair of the DNC and worked for President Bill Clinton um so a lot of these allegations are coming out to try to discredit it but voters want transparency we're we're we're exercising our first our First Amendment right and again when a ballot line is is launched when a ticket is launched they'll VI by that uh but again we're just securing the ballot right now so no labels is suing Arizona Secretary of State Adrien Fontes right now what's behind that lawsuit well you talking about no labels has been very clear you know we're running this on the presidential level uh not interested in Fielding candidates in in uh in all areas and um and so there there my understanding and I can let the attorney speak more to it but my understanding is that there's an individual who try to get on the ballot in multiple States and we're trying to protect our ballot line because we're offering it to president vice president ticket the question is the petitions that were circulated to circulating to get no labels on the ballot here said there would be primaries would be primary candidates were you aware of that yeah and again our attorneys on the ground been dealing with this I would defer to them as speaking to the legalities of that but you know operating in 50 states 50 different jurisdictions plus DC and getting on the ballot is obviously an arduous task um and so again we we deferred our attorneys as it relates to those so specifics okay and just just to finish that that part of the conversation uh Secretary of State Adrien Fontes who did allow no labels on the ballot after the petitions were filed said uh he believes uh this is part of a plan this uh no labels as resisting because quote it might actually hook them into reporting their finances they want to manipulate the system that way so I basically told them to pound sand that's a quote from he gave to the New Yorker any response no I don't have any interest in going tip for tat I what I will say is this we've been complying with the rule of law in all in our efforts to get on the bout in all 50 states plus Washington DC so my understanding is you plan an April convention to select a nominee we're in the process of of finalizing you know what that looks like as far as Recruitment and selection but look to have a named ballot by sometime next spring we're set on running this ticket under two conditions number one Americans have to want another choice and if if Trump or Biden or both uh fall off and they're replaced by uh candidates who the majority of Americans want to vote for instead of vote against and we'll stand down or if our Pathway to Victory uh closes up and our our modeling and our polling shows that we have a pathway to the 270 electoral votes No Labels has a pathway to 270 without a candidate who's with a candidate who won't be named until April when when when our polling and data uh shows are you open to voting for a bipartisan ticket the ceiling was so high and again let's let's remember that in a majority of States 48 out of 50 in order to win all electoral votes you just need the plurality biggest slice of the pie so in in a standard duopa you need 50% plus one in a three-way race that number can drop down to 35 so if you don't get to 50 will there be a candidate if you don't get the 50 States state on the ballot and 50 states we're we have a strategy to get on all 50 plus DC you know if if that strategy or if that pathway closes down then we're not interested in running we're not interested in being a spoiler or you know coming on taking votes from one party or another and so when people talk about a spoiler that's usually in regards to Fringe candidates you know people who take overwhelmingly from one side or another like a Jill Stein or Ralph nater uh our number suggests we draw evenly from both sides but I think for being inally honest you're not going to know exactly what kind of impact it has until you have names on the back it's it's a very you know you recognize L people don't do this every four years because it is a very cumbersome Audis and and timec consuming process to get on the ballot everywhere and then a Monumental task an expensive task to run for president it is but you know again looking at these these current choices and I think the viewers would agree U nobody's thrilled to go to the polls in November people want another option and we're prepared to give it to them got to end it there Joe Cunningham thanks so much for joining us thanks for

voters another option because I think it's very evident that folks are just unhappy with these choices we're on about a dozen states right now uh look to be on about 20 by the end of the year we're on the boutot here in Arizona and again we're fighting to give Americans the choice that they deserve so you mentioned uh no labels is on the ballot in Arizona 4 million registered voters here about 18,000 have registered with no labels that is 0.5% or so uh of registered voters is that a movement does that tell us this is working because it's not taking off well look no labels has been around for over 12 years and so when you go around the country I go around the country speaking to people more and more people know who we are and what we're doing and we've been around for a Dozen Years mainly operating within Congress you know I was when I served I was a member of the problem solvers caucus which No Labels helped start with Kon Cinema yeah yeah she was a congressman exactly yeah and Cinema moved over to the Senate side when I was coming into the house but we worked with moderates like her uh like Joe Mansion Susan Collins uh all the folks over on the Senate side who wanted to bridge that partisan divide um I was able to get two my bills through a divided Congress and signed in law by President Trump because I was working in organization and in a caucus that valued by partisanship and look I think you know where we are as a country most people are somewhere near the middle you know they're not off to majority of the country is not off to the far left or the far right uh and no labels is stepping up and given that Common Sense majority of voice because a lot of people feel either politically homeless or they feel like they're not represented uh so they should have a voice and that's what we're doing so let's talk about the questions about No No Labels uh you say voters want this choice so do donors who have helped to fund um no labels getting on the ballot who are the donors who want this no labels um again it's been around for 12 years and some of these questions that come up now I I find a little bit um interesting about the timing because we've been operating in this space for over a dozen years but now you're putting up a presidential candid the game has changed we're putting up a ticket we're not going to be running a campaign and I think you know whoever runs a campaign whether it be the Super Pac and obviously the presidential election they should abide by the the letter of the law right no labels a C4 it's a nonprofit all we're doing is securing the ballot line and we're operating like a C4 and this goes back to um a lot of people want to say who who are the donors this or that in an effort to intimidate the people that are working to try to get another option uh people have been very very vocal about that this goes back to the Supreme Court case Alabama versus the NAACP where you know the Supreme Court ruled that no you can't intimidate people and you can't you know force people to to show their roles or their members or their donors in this this realm of C4s but isn't that a fundamental piece of information you're asking voters to come along before they even got involved there's some people who they don't know whose identities they don't know who want this it's being presented as a Centrist organization right no labels how do they know this is truly a Centrist organization the people behind this are truly Centrist well take a take a look at the organization you know I'm a I'm a former Democratic congressman who serves but it does it takes money to get the organization it does take money and for for example you know harlon Crow's name has been mentioned as a donor I don't know to what extent is that accurate I I mean I can't say whether it is or it isn't again we we don't release the names of our donors but I would tell people this look at Who's involved in look who's putting their names out there whether it be Senator Joe leverman Dr Ben shavis a civil rights hero um you know again I'm a former congressman who voted to impeach Trump who voted you know to put country ahead of party uh the group was started by Nancy Jacobson uh former Finance uh uh chair of the DNC and worked for President Bill Clinton um so a lot of these allegations are coming out to try to discredit it but voters want transparency we're we're we're exercising our first our First Amendment right and again when a ballot line is is launched when a ticket is launched they'll VI by that uh but again we're just securing the ballot right now so no labels is suing Arizona Secretary of State Adrien Fontes right now what's behind that lawsuit well you talking about no labels has been very clear you know we're running this on the presidential level uh not interested in Fielding candidates in in uh in all areas and um and so there there my understanding and I can let the attorney speak more to it but my understanding is that there's an individual who try to get on the ballot in multiple States and we're trying to protect our ballot line because we're offering it to president vice president ticket the question is the petitions that were circulated to circulating to get no labels on the ballot here said there would be primaries would be primary candidates were you aware of that yeah and again our attorneys on the ground been dealing with this I would defer to them as speaking to the legalities of that but you know operating in 50 states 50 different jurisdictions plus DC and getting on the ballot is obviously an arduous task um and so again we we deferred our attorneys as it relates to those so specifics okay and just just to finish that that part of the conversation uh Secretary of State Adrien Fontes who did allow no labels on the ballot after the petitions were filed said uh he believes uh this is part of a plan this uh no labels as resisting because quote it might actually hook them into reporting their finances they want to manipulate the system that way so I basically told them to pound sand that's a quote from he gave to the New Yorker any response no I don't have any interest in going tip for tat I what I will say is this we've been complying with the rule of law in all in our efforts to get on the bout in all 50 states plus Washington DC so my understanding is you plan an April convention to select a nominee we're in the process of of finalizing you know what that looks like as far as Recruitment and selection but look to have a named ballot by sometime next spring we're set on running this ticket under two conditions number one Americans have to want another choice and if if Trump or Biden or both uh fall off and they're replaced by uh candidates who the majority of Americans want to vote for instead of vote against and we'll stand down or if our Pathway to Victory uh closes up and our our modeling and our polling shows that we have a pathway to the 270 electoral votes No Labels has a pathway to 270 without a candidate who's with a candidate who won't be named until April when when when our polling and data uh shows are you open to voting for a bipartisan ticket the ceiling was so high and again let's let's remember that in a majority of States 48 out of 50 in order to win all electoral votes you just need the plurality biggest slice of the pie so in in a standard duopa you need 50% plus one in a three-way race that number can drop down to 35 so if you don't get to 50 will there be a candidate if you don't get the 50 States state on the ballot and 50 states we're we have a strategy to get on all 50 plus DC you know if if that strategy or if that pathway closes down then we're not interested in running we're not interested in being a spoiler or you know coming on taking votes from one party or another and so when people talk about a spoiler that's usually in regards to Fringe candidates you know people who take overwhelmingly from one side or another like a Jill Stein or Ralph nater uh our number suggests we draw evenly from both sides but I think for being inally honest you're not going to know exactly what kind of impact it has until you have names on the back it's it's a very you know you recognize L people don't do this every four years because it is a very cumbersome Audis and and timec consuming process to get on the ballot everywhere and then a Monumental task an expensive task to run for president it is but you know again looking at these these current choices and I think the viewers would agree U nobody's thrilled to go to the polls in November people want another option and we're prepared to give it to them got to end it there Joe Cunningham thanks so much for joining us thanks for

Johnson and Marc Short join the Meet the Press roundtable to discuss the ...", "video_transcript": "the panel is here NBC News managing Washington editor Carol Lee former Homeland Security secretary Jay Johnson and Mark short former Chief of Staff to vice president Mike Pence thank you for all of you for being here today Carol let me start with you and just set the stage because you have some news that you just reported out moments ago which is basically that the president's top adviser in the Middle East is heading to Israel what do you know well that's right Kristen Brett mcer the president's Top Middle East ad visor scheduled to head to the Middle East this week he'll go to Israel and his his mission is to focus on the release of hostages he's also going to qar which has been key in these negotiations over the release of hostages and they're exploring multiple options the administration is and one of those options is securing the release of about 80 women and children who are being held hostage and in exchange for that the release of Palestinian women and teenagers that are being held by Israel it's one option there's no guarantee that any of this is going to succeed but Brett mcer is going to travel there to try to move this forward and it all comes as the administration is trying to weigh its support with Israel and its growing concerns about how Israel is carrying out this war in particular there is concerns officials tell me that Israel is not doing enough to try to minimize civilian casualties there are officials that that don't believe that Israel cares that the Israeli government cares that public opinion is turning against them and it all comes as conversations I'm told between Israeli officials and US officials are getting increasingly testy and at the same time Kristen were told that there's no change in strategy that the the administration is going to stand with Israel they're continue to give the support that it needs that President Biden feels like his approach has given him the influence that he needs to get things like pauses and humanitarian Aid well it's such great reporting and Jay it takes me to my next point because you heard prime minister netanyahu's defiance when I pressed him on this idea that there are protests all around the world calling for a ceasefire calling for an end to the civilian deaths if the reporting is to be believed uh civilian deaths in Gaza are about to become 10 times the number of Israeli deaths on October 7th uh prime minister said that the Israeli Defense Forces are not targeting civilians of course they're not targeting civilians no one really believes that they're targeting civilians however you can Target the enemy the terrorist and have a callous disregard for civilian deaths and violate the laws of armed conflict and that's the rising concern across the globe right now I give the administration the Biden Administration a lot of credit for firmly standing behind Israel right after October 7th but also publicly and privately uh warning the government of Israel about civilian casualties about the possibility of a ceasefire uh getting humanitarian Aid they're walking a fine line but I think our government is doing the best it can right now and Mark weigh in on this because politically speaking Republicans this week had a debate they largely stood firmly by Israel just as the Biden Administration has been doing on Capitol Hill a battle is playing out about how to get funding for Israel it's not included in this first proposal to keep the government open how much urgency do you think there is to get something ped on Israel Aid I think there's urgency and I think speaker Johnson is uniquely positioned right now in a very uh divided conference to help United and get that done I don't know that I accept the premise though Kristen your question that the house of Republicans and the people on the stage are the same position as the Biden Administration I do think the Biden Administration is getting weak need on this I think it's concerning there's never been there's not been an attack in 80 years like this on the Israeli and Jewish people we're seeing a rise of anti-Semitism like we have not seen and yet the messaging is concerned about  islamophobia I think the reality is we need to stand with Israel right now and I think the Republicans on that stage and Republican members of Congress are willing to do that Jay what's your reaction to What March has said I I mean I agree I think we need to stand by Israel uh I see public opinion political opinion in this country shifting as Carol pointed out and uh increasingly as the civilian deaths in Gaza are highlighted every night on the news um you know the opinion in Congress May shift as well but um this is a very tough situation it's sure is and it's all coming against the backdrop of these election results that we saw on Tuesday Carol and because you never sleep you have more reporting about all of this as well and the fact that this was a mixed week for Democrats they had wins on Tuesday night on the flip side they had some uh poll numbers that were really troubling to them the fact that Biden Trails Trump in five out of six key Battleground States and then Senator Joe Mansion announcing he's not running for re-election if you look at the Battleground map it shows you just how tough it is for Democrats to hold on to the Senate there you see Ohio Arizona the toss-ups what's the strategy that you're hearing within the Biden campaign well first on Senator Mansion the White House tried to convince him to run for re-election obviously that that didn't work the the officials that talked to said that they don't think he'll ultimately run third party but they don't actually really know they think that he's worried about his legacy he doesn't want to be seen as electing former president Trump and also has a good relationship with President Biden and wouldn't want to do put him in that position so there's that in terms of where the president and his team are after those polls and the election I'm told that the president is feeling really good after that Tuesday's election that he also heard privately from allies of his that he needs to take the fight to president former president Trump much more directly and he made a concerted decision to do that at an event with union workers where he went after the president former president and said look I've been there for you and I hope you remember that and he also took him called him out on abortion and it's supposed to increase he's going to increasingly do that and and Jay I mean take us inside what Democrats are saying are alarm Bells going off and and is this the right shift in strategy as Carol says they're president's going to shift to taking on Trump he's in campaign mode now despite the fact the White House said they were going to wait until the spring first of all we are a year from the election I agree with David Brooks polls are where people vent it's not where they vote and you look at you you look at history you look where Obama was in 2011 you look where Barack Obama was in 2007 30 points behind Hillary Clinton right now so it's it's still a long way to go I do not believe Joe Mansion is going to be a third party candidate for president I don't think he wants to be perceived as the spoiler that handers the hands the election of Donald Trump so it's still a long way Mark what do you make of this moment and what we all witnessed on Tuesday night how much do you think abortion is a motivating factor for the Democratic base and how concerned are Republicans about that well I think the Republican party needs pro-life voters and the reality is the party needs to continue to be the party for Life uh there's no doubt that right now the left is more energized since the do's decision than the right is I think that's apparent but I also think that accepting I think as Tim Scott said on your debate stage accepting a a press a minimum that says when a baby can feel pain that's where we're going to protect life I think is generally supported by a majority of Americans I don't think we've articulated that well and I think we need to contrast the Democrat position which is abortion on demand up until birth Which is far is more in line with North Korea and China than it is with developed world I mean the the position of taking a a limiting abortion once you can begin to feel pain is even to the left of where France and macrone is where the limit is 12 to 14 weeks all right okay thank you guys for a great conversation really appreciate it thanks for watching stay updated about breaking news and top stories on the NBC News app or follow us on social

wins the State title we caught up with Sophia after the game as Resurrection wins it for the first time since 2014 we came from kind of an iffy season um and really showed up during State and it really showed um and during the last point I was just ultimately confident in every one of my teammates um yeah University is a great competitor but I knew we had it and in 48 Thompson Valley taking on Palmer Ridge whose Ace would also win the State title this one would go all five decided by just two points and last but not least in 5A fil Ridge taking on Valor Christian for all the marbles and in an exciting twist Fel Ridge would take set one and the F know just how big that set win is and this one would take all five Grace Langer with the kill for Valor but to set point ellton set outside to Fair Ike but it's dug up fil Ridge hits the net and game over Valor wins backto back state titles marking 58th consecutive wins mostly on the timeouts on the sideline we just come in and we always say heart and smart and serve and pass so always first Contact always loving the game having a huge heart for it and playing smart proud of these ladies I mean we all have worked so hard for this and I mean words cannot really describe how beautiful this was it was amazing over on the soccer field the crested but Titans taking on Bishop match buff in the class 2A State title game now to the 55th minute Titans possession and look at the footwork Junior Sawyer Barney with the left would score the game's only goal now crb defeats Bishop match one ZIP at wierfield for its fourth state championship in program history they're third in the last four years here's Barney it felt so good I mean that's like that's the stuff I'm thinking about last night of course um it's like the best thing it's the best feeling in high school soccer it's going to go in the final so that was awesome of course but I really just can't words can't explain it in 3A is Colorado Academy taking on coold Ridge and CA wasted no time Caleb Miz to connects in the seventh minute to take the lead but gold Bridge would make it a game Isaac Thompson ties it up in the 52nd minute one a piece but in attack mode Simeon W johanes scores the go-ahead goal in the 61st minute in Colorado Academy goes back to back as 3A boys state soccer Champions here's what your HZ on what it feels like to run it back it's pretty hard cuz every we're going to get everyone's uh best game so you know we uh we struggled in the middle of the season with Pak to beig we lost and they really wanted to get us back but you know we we galvanized the troops and uh we brought it back so we're just happy over in 4A it's Battle Mountain who says they're ready to take on the Northfield Nighthawks for it all and Battle Mountain would strike first Leo Martinez attacking in the 20th minute and scores the first goal of the game and then it will be Cooper Skidmore in minute 72 and the Huskies win it preventing The Nighthawks from capping off an undefeated season we caught up with senior Ford Cooper Skidmore after the huge win it's just awesome you know we we came here last year um same situation same team and they they sent us home so we worked so hard together and it's so nice to be rewarded for it and in 5A Broomfield taking on Denver East but look at this entrance made for Champions at least one of these teams will be but to the game Broomfield possession and my goodness Marcus Von with a bicycle kick to get the scoring started what a goal but Denver East would tie it up on a free kick by Theo Scott two overtimes later and we head to a shootout Broomfield leads by one and it comes down to this keeper for the Eagles Evan goad makes the save to win the game for the Eagles ninth State title in program history here's senior Marcus Von after possibly the kick of the year I saw it up and I was like Hey a shot's a shot I'll do it as soon as I connected with it it was the best connection I've ever had and I was like wait a minute and I turned around see it in the goal it was surreal it was a surreal moment and before we go basketball season is approaching and this year arapo and Heritage high

Head coach ...", "video_transcript": "um excited for our team uh come back and uh get another win at US Bank Stadium was our goal um coming off of our last performance and what the crowd was like um a few weeks back and and then to have them show up again today thought the crowd was phenomenal the juice the energy um and it really fueled and and really got us going especially in that first half uh complimentary effort all the way around in the first half would have liked to you know maybe uh have the chance to put the football G football game away you know got a touchdown pulled off the the board there on a short yardage situation but good defense over there um some really good skill players and um you know offensively uh they've been doing some good things so it was going to take a complete team effort 60 Minutes of football and and uh we got it done so excited for that group locker room uh you know feeling very strongly about you know where we're at as a football team right now but also total awareness that it's back to work and a continued emphasis on um improving I want to give you guys an update Jordan Hicks uh you know a low lower leg um kind of contusion um and he did not return once he came back in the game for a few plays did not return um we'll see how that swelling looks and and if we can get that uh to go down um Caleb Evans did not return with a calf um and then Alex Madison did not return with a concussion um suain there but uh you know a lot of guys stepped up you know didn't have KJ didn't have you know some guys that we've been without for a few weeks and that next man up mentality continues to flourish with guys ready to step on the grass and and go do their jobs to help us win football games thought TJ hackinson was you know as good as I've ever seen him when we absolutely needed him the most just like he was last week uh you know can't can't say enough about TJ and then of course Josh um you know having fun coaching him right now just because you know there's a lot that goes into it but then when we get to play football ball he goes out there and he looks like he's enjoying himself I know his teammates are enjoying watching him continue to get acclimated to our team um and just really proud of Josh and and Josh knows for he's he's ready to get back to work and continue the momentum on this thing this was not a shut out but you didn't turn the ball over yeah that's you know knowing kind of historically um it's always a win a win or lose type stat um we learned that lesson uh quite honestly early on in the year um when I talk about uh our team and how we're built from substance uh there's some there's some football things in there now too as far as what we've learned uh you know how we need to play technique and fundamentals of how we carry the football decision-making timing accuracy and then the defense's ability to continue helping us win the turnover battle by making some critical plays especially in the second half when you know we were we scuffled a few drives there and and it's totally on me uh got to give our guys a better opportunity to move the ball offensively but um that's where the complimentary phasing comes in I had guys coming up to me on the sidelines we got you coach hey next snap's going to be the best snap um even when we got the touchdown taken off the board offensively the expectation was um that we could still convert had a chance on that third and uh 11 but uh you know compliments to our football team our leadership um and just the way these guys now believe in in the man next to them and they believe in each other to go continue to improve there's still a long way to go we got to continue to get a lot better um I've got to continue to you know coach better and and get our staff which I thought our staff did a hell of a job today especially uh you know Flo and his guys again U you know that's a that's a talented outfit over there I do hope that uh you know Derek Carr's okay um got a lot of respect for Derek and and everything he's done in this league but when jamus Winston comes in the game and and you know how physically talented he is for our defense to keep them out and and let us you know hold on to that Victory I was really proud of that those guys said you're having fun coaching Josh do give yourself a second on the field during the game to enjoy it or is it no during the week kind of thing that yeah I think it's just looking back on the week uh Kevin off of last week's game and then knowing you know the time spent with Josh and and just watching him with our coaches watching him with our offense I thought he had a fantastic week of practice um really when you know Thursday and Friday uh you know you would have thought he been in our offense for a lot longer than just uh the previous five you know days leading into last week's game um he attacked the game plan how we prepare our guys um how we teach them about you know coverages and fronts and pressures and what we're trying to attack and um he handled a full game plan today um and it was Josh dobs out there playing quarterback and we saw it again today gamechanging plays with his athleticism were really a defining thing to kind of fill in some of the gaps for us offensively in the first half um and I just can't say enough about you know his last two performances to to be two and 0 with him and and with so much room for us all to improve um it's what I'm excited about the most playing through a couple injuries there did did you have to you find yourself having to manage his workload at all the day or yeah yeah we we tried to get you know on some of those early down calls we tried to get Johnny in there a little bit more use Josh in some of the 11 groupings a little more and then you know mixing and matching Personnel making sure you know I give Brian Angelo a lot of credit because um you know just howling into the headset a bunch of gibberish but I want the right guys on the field and make sure we're managing TJ so he can make some of those huge plays in the P game but TJ wanted to be out there for everything um and you know he was out there made some had some big big blocks in the Run game um and just all the way around uh TJ was phenomenal today had if you had to change things up and dig a little creatively you and the coaching stamp to make sure that the players you put out there are successful yeah absolutely absolutely especially against a you know that's another top you know top 10 defense they've always been tough physical um hard to you know they're going to force some negative plays and we were trying to avoid those knowing that we can then you know get into the different phases of our offense to try to uh you know it's one thing to try to marry it but um there's other things especially with you know Josh's athleticism and um kind of an inside out passing game still wanting to get Jordan and Speedy and and Brandon Powell going as well you know the screen game um there's a lot that goes into it but the creativity I give our guys you know I love the love the design we had on on the uh you know Tai chanders touchdown there um even on both of them even the one that got called back situational calls there um and then we'll continue to build on our inventory because um I think our Personnel give us the opportunity to do that to to try to give ourselves advantages buyback some numbers and angles and things like that um but back to work and we'll we'll keep on trying to improve on that stuff the Los of these great players and just continue to get win yeah I think it's uh putting together plans to try to maximize the guys we do have uh up for us uh you know guys like TJ and Jordan um Alex and Tai but then continuing to ask you know guys that have stepped up already like a Brandon Powell um great to get Speedy back in there today um which which I I was really proud of the way he went out there and um he might have not always got the ball but you know I know he was separating and bursting and playing fast and that's going to be a great uh great addition back into our offense you know but it's truly about you know how well can we execute uh the scheme what we're trying to get accomplished can we give our guys that Premier Premier mindset um regardless of who's in the game and then the expectation is if it is a one-on-one go win uh pitch and catch uh you know progress in Rhythm I thought Josh did a really nice job in this game especially in the first first half I've really trust in that protection oine gave him time and he exhausted some progressions and then still used his legs that's really hard on a defense and and you saw them kind of respond a little bit spying them a little more doing a little bit more of that in the second half and that's when you know it it gets exciting to think about when we do get a Justin Jefferson and KJ and and our full group back um you know defense is having to account for for his ability to activate his legs will only help other things we want to do goad sorry how has that running ability like change the play calling for you Chang the offense yeah I think it just um you know it allows me to you know be aggressive knowing that if we get the premere look I'm hunting or looking for some scouted looks that you know have a lot of confidence there but also his decision making and and then knowing kind of the perfect balance I mean when he found TJ off schedule uh you know drop eight to Tampa and and he's you know working it knowing he's got time you know a veteran kind of feel of three-man Rush still buying some time getting out and keeping his eyes up I mean those are all really exciting things um that that Josh did today and then there were still some uh you know dynamic throws from the pocket in Rhythm play passes third down I thought the third and long conversion in the second half was was a nice one kind of feeling the zones and being aggressive right there to BP over the ball um you know so there was just there's a lot to build off of there's like I said there's a lot of things that uh I'll continue to improve on to try to help Josh and the rest of our offense um but really encouraging kind of two performances in a row um that we can operate with that group of guys on the field and continue to move the ball against a really good defense more impressed by the fact that he's what he able to do last week with almost no time the offense or what he did this week against a good defense that prepared for yeah I think last week was you know I I can't you know emphasize enough what the circumstances were for him and in our offense last week but what I think was really special this week is even coming off of that performance his work how he prepared um you know he was you know essentially living at the facility and going through his normal process while also allowing us to kind of show him how we do things how we try to you know enhance his ability to play fast while also giv him really good plays that he can be responsible for getting to one versus the other at the line still using Tempo commun communicating the way he is um so I thought uh it was pretty pretty outstanding day from Josh and the best thing about it is uh we're all still getting to know each other and uh getting a comfort level to where we can continue to apply layers to this thing to try to be the most successful we can be on offense the direct snap when did you guys put that in and what made that the moment to call it there at the go yeah um we put that in you know we put it in this week uh we've had a couple things kind of similar thoughts up um at at other times um but uh you know we just wanted to try to you know find some different unique ways against it's a really really good front that it's hard to just get big with them and think you're just going to run in the ball down there not very many people have um so we wanted to try to see different ways we can try to get numbers at the point uh still still have a chance to you know punch it in but also give ourselves an advantage of making them react on the Fly and and I thought our guys executed it you know soon as I saw a big CD out there with really one guy left thought we were in good shape how big has DJ W been for you guys these last few weeks yeah huge I mean there was a sequence there where he individually kind of wrecked the game with a sack and and you know tripping up I think he tripped up Derek on a on a scramble that got them off the field uh DJ's been really it's been as consistent uh as any player on our football team this year and denil has been outstanding for us but I think DJ has really fed off that as well we ask him to do a lot of different jobs that maybe don't jump out at people as far as you know impactful but he's making an impact on every snap and he just keeps doing it week after week you know I I gave him a game ball in there and and you know he's one of those guys that you know I've said this before but the guys in that locker room know they know the coaching staff and his teammates know um and they went crazy for him you know knowing that DJ is one of those guys that maybe doesn't get all the headlines but all he does is show up every Sunday and play winning football but when you have a big lead like that in the second half how difficult can it be to kind of find that balance between wanting to run the ball and move the clock but also yeah not wanting to take your foot off the gas yeah I think it comes down to you know knowing the fact that you want to be aggressive but you also want to walk out of the stadium still winning the turnover battle and and one of the I was that confident in our defense uh that if we didn't give them anything um and we played you know smart with the clock uh that we could get it down to a situation where uh maybe we can get a third and one and and and get a touchdown on that play we did and and that would take us to 34 and then you know it gets pulled back and we don't convert and we end up punting and trying to pin them deep there but um you know I've got to try to find that balance where I do believe in our guys I do believe um that I can stay aggressive for four quarters with our guys um and and I'll continue to work through that to make sure I'm giving them some premium Ops we had some chances there um that uh maybe we didn't make the play but there were certainly a few that I'd like to have back and and knowing that situational management and milking the clock is one thing but staying aggressive is something we've got to do as well when Josh does what he does spins around and scores and you're turning and looking up at the crowd like what's going through your head yeah I mean a lot of times you know I like to fist pump with the best of them but that was one where I was kind of just wow you know they I was going to tip my hat to the Saints they you know ran a you know Zone coverage there on third down they got a little pressure in there on them um had a couple chances here and there but U when a guy makes a play like that um it's exciting it's exciting because you know that uh he just overcame a lot with an indiv idual effort right there to finish it for six points um huge huge momentum play by him and that's one of the reasons why you know listen Josh dobs didn't just start doing those things um that's been a part of his game since he's been an NFL quarterback and before that um our job is continue to allow him to play the position the way he he he thrives playing it while continuing to do our jobs which we feel pretty good about schematically helping him as well um but like I said we'll continue to build on it um I'm proud of Josh and we'll get right back to work tomorrow how does that impact you as a play caller when you have a quarterback now that can do those things and adds that element to the offense with him being able to run yeah I mean you guys know we've seen a lot of shell coverage even even with you know Justin and some of our guys out um we've seen a lot of you know coverage where people are saying hey we're just going to rush four potentially even drop eight and Rush three uh and and you know he made he you know made some big plays to today against some of those looks um can we get more man coverage can we be effective executing against man coverage two I mean this team I believe led the league and interceptions coming in and they're very very good the corner spots the safeties are are really good and they have two of the best inside linebackers in football um so when you look at their you know and I didn't even say anything about a front that I think with 94 and that group um it's a challenge at every level of their defense so as a play caller you know you can start to feel like hey I can call anything on this call sheet but then uh you know I want to be smart I want to be making sure that the calls uh reflect you know my intentions of of trying to attack certain looks and then when Josh makes a play it's it's a huge huge bonus and um what I love is just you know how all of our guys you know are finishing those plays you see when he finds TJ on that scramble who' you see down there bar barreling through the pile probably Dalton Ryner if I if my memory serves me right so our guys are you know they understand now it's whistle to whistle and uh we might be playing through the echo of it a little bit more on unique things that maybe we didn't before uh when we were you know you not that we didn't have Mobility at the position but M cirk was playing as well as anybody in this league uh you know really ripping apart coverage and attacking things and kind of running everything U Josh in two starts is kind of shown us U what Mobility you know in addition to what we do offensively can do for us um in this tough time where we're trying to overcome the loss of of a guy like Kirk last one yeah Kevin you start 0 and three you lose Jefferson you l cousins been in locker room where things looked like they were the sky was falling how are you guys in this position right now yeah the sky was never falling uh to those guys in that locker room I can remember vividly standing in front of them you know the Monday after we we did go 0 and three um and I can remember the message was I felt um you know all of us together included working forward to accomplish something special was one of the greatest opportunities uh we would have professionally U you know adversity truly if you look at it as an opportunity and you have your football team all looking Inward and trying to be the best versions of themselves for that greater good of trying to accomplish something special um I am of the belief that we can continue to go out and and uh Write Our Own Story and we're holding the pen there's a lot of challenges out in front of us we've got to laser our Focus like we've done each opportunity each day each meeting each walkthr each practice and when you do it the way these guys have um and we've got the leadership that we do uh my expect a is things will continue to be um you know what we've been thanks guys", "aigc_title": "Kevin O'Connell's Remarks on Vikings' Victory Over Saints and Team's Performance",

the right guys on the field and make sure we're managing TJ so he can make some of those huge plays in the P game but TJ wanted to be out there for everything um and you know he was out there made some had some big big blocks in the Run game um and just all the way around uh TJ was phenomenal today had if you had to change things up and dig a little creatively you and the coaching stamp to make sure that the players you put out there are successful yeah absolutely absolutely especially against a you know that's another top you know top 10 defense they've always been tough physical um hard to you know they're going to force some negative plays and we were trying to avoid those knowing that we can then you know get into the different phases of our offense to try to uh you know it's one thing to try to marry it but um there's other things especially with you know Josh's athleticism and um kind of an inside out passing game still wanting to get Jordan and Speedy and and Brandon Powell going as well you know the screen game um there's a lot that goes into it but the creativity I give our guys you know I love the love the design we had on on the uh you know Tai chanders touchdown there um even on both of them even the one that got called back situational calls there um and then we'll continue to build on our inventory because um I think our Personnel give us the opportunity to do that to to try to give ourselves advantages buyback some numbers and angles and things like that um but back to work and we'll we'll keep on trying to improve on that stuff the Los of these great players and just continue to get win yeah I think it's uh putting together plans to try to maximize the guys we do have uh up for us uh you know guys like TJ and Jordan um Alex and Tai but then continuing to ask you know guys that have stepped up already like a Brandon Powell um great to get Speedy back in there today um which which I I was really proud of the way he went out there and um he might have not always got the ball but you know I know he was separating and bursting and playing fast and that's going to be a great uh great addition back into our offense you know but it's truly about you know how well can we execute uh the scheme what we're trying to get accomplished can we give our guys that Premier Premier mindset um regardless of who's in the game and then the expectation is if it is a one-on-one go win uh pitch and catch uh you know progress in Rhythm I thought Josh did a really nice job in this game especially in the first first half I've really trust in that protection oine gave him time and he exhausted some progressions and then still used his legs that's really hard on a defense and and you saw them kind of respond a little bit spying them a little more doing a little bit more of that in the second half and that's when you know it it gets exciting to think about when we do get a Justin Jefferson and KJ and and our full group back um you know defense is having to account for for his ability to activate his legs will only help other things we want to do goad sorry how has that running ability like change the play calling for you Chang the offense yeah I think it just um you know it allows me to you know be aggressive knowing that if we get the premere look I'm hunting or looking for some scouted looks that you know have a lot of confidence there but also his decision making and and then knowing kind of the perfect balance I mean when he found TJ off schedule uh you know drop eight to Tampa and and he's you know working it knowing he's got time you know a veteran kind of feel of three-man Rush still buying some time getting out and keeping his eyes up I mean those are all really exciting things um that that Josh did today and then there were still some uh you know dynamic throws from the pocket in Rhythm play passes third down I thought the third and long conversion in the second half was was a nice one kind of feeling the zones and being aggressive right there to BP over the ball um you know so there was just there's a lot to build off of there's like I said there's a lot of things that uh I'll continue to improve on to try to help Josh and the rest of our offense um but really encouraging kind of two performances in a row um that we can operate with that group of guys on the field and continue to move the ball against a really good defense more impressed by the fact that he's what he able to do last week with almost no time the offense or what he did this week against a good defense that prepared for yeah I think last week was you know I I can't you know emphasize enough what the circumstances were for him and in our offense last week but what I think was really special this week is even coming off of that performance his work how he prepared um you know he was you know essentially living at the facility and going through his normal process while also allowing us to kind of show him how we do things how we try to you know enhance his ability to play fast while also giv him really good plays that he can be responsible for getting to one versus the other at the line still using Tempo commun communicating the way he is um so I thought uh it was pretty pretty outstanding day from Josh and the best thing about it is uh we're all still getting to know each other and uh getting a comfort level to where we can continue to apply layers to this thing to try to be the most successful we can be on offense the direct snap when did you guys put that in and what made that the moment to call it there at the go yeah um we put that in you know we put it in this week uh we've had a couple things kind of similar thoughts up um at at other times um but uh you know we just wanted to try to you know find some different unique ways against it's a really really good front that it's hard to just get big with them and think you're just going to run in the ball down there not very many people have um so we wanted to try to see different ways we can try to get numbers at the point uh still still have a chance to you know punch it in but also give ourselves an advantage of making them react on the Fly and and I thought our guys executed it you know soon as I saw a big CD out there with really one guy left thought we were in good shape how big has DJ W been for you guys these last few weeks yeah huge I mean there was a sequence there where he individually kind of wrecked the game with a sack and and you know tripping up I think he tripped up Derek on a on a scramble that got them off the field uh DJ's been really it's been as consistent uh as any player on our football team this year and denil has been outstanding for us but I think DJ has really fed off that as well we ask him to do a lot of different jobs that maybe don't jump out at people as far as you know impactful but he's making an impact on every snap and he just keeps doing it week after week you know I I gave him a game ball in there and and you know he's one of those guys that you know I've said this before but the guys in that locker room know they know the coaching staff and his teammates know um and they went crazy for him you know knowing that DJ is one of those guys that maybe doesn't get all the headlines but all he does is show up every Sunday and play winning football but when you have a big lead like that in the second half how difficult can it be to kind of find that balance between wanting to run the ball and move the clock but also yeah not wanting to take your foot off the gas yeah I think it comes down to you know knowing the fact that you want to be aggressive but you also want to walk out of the stadium still winning the turnover battle and and one of the I was that confident in our defense uh that if we didn't give them anything um and we played you know smart with the clock uh that we could get it down to a situation where uh maybe we can get a third and one and and and get a touchdown on that play we did and and that would take us to 34 and then you know it gets pulled back and we don't convert and we end up punting and trying to pin them deep there but um you know I've got to try to find that balance where I do believe in our guys I do believe um that I can stay aggressive for four quarters with our guys um and and I'll continue to work through that to make sure I'm giving them some premium Ops we had some chances there um that uh maybe we didn't make the play but there were certainly a few that I'd like to have back and and knowing that situational management and milking the clock is one thing but staying aggressive is something we've got to do as well when Josh does what he does spins around and scores and you're turning and looking up at the crowd like what's going through your head yeah I mean a lot of times you know I like to fist pump with the best of them but that was one where I was kind of just wow you know they I was going to tip my hat to the Saints they you know ran a you know Zone coverage there on third down they got a little pressure in there on them um had a couple chances here and there but U when a guy makes a play like that um it's exciting it's exciting because you know that uh he just overcame a lot with an indiv idual effort right there to finish it for six points um huge huge momentum play by him and that's one of the reasons why you know listen Josh dobs didn't just start doing those things um that's been a part of his game since he's been an NFL quarterback and before that um our job is continue to allow him to play the position the way he he he thrives playing it while continuing to do our jobs which we feel pretty good about schematically helping him as well um but like I said we'll continue to build on it um I'm proud of Josh and we'll get right back to work tomorrow how does that impact you as a play caller when you have a quarterback now that can do those things and adds that element to the offense with him being able to run yeah I mean you guys know we've seen a lot of shell coverage even even with you know Justin and some of our guys out um we've seen a lot of you know coverage where people are saying hey we're just going to rush four potentially even drop eight and Rush three uh and and you know he made he you know made some big plays to today against some of those looks um can we get more man coverage can we be effective executing against man coverage two I mean this team I believe led the league and interceptions coming in and they're very very good the corner spots the safeties are are really good and they have two of the best inside linebackers in football um so when you look at their you know and I didn't even say anything about a front that I think with 94 and that group um it's a challenge at every level of their defense so as a play caller you know you can start to feel like hey I can call anything on this call sheet but then uh you know I want to be smart I want to be making sure that the calls uh reflect you know my intentions of of trying to attack certain looks and then when Josh makes a play it's it's a huge huge bonus and um what I love is just you know how all of our guys you know are finishing those plays you see when he finds TJ on that scramble who' you see down there bar barreling through the pile probably Dalton Ryner if I if my memory serves me right so our guys are you know they understand now it's whistle to whistle and uh we might be playing through the echo of it a little bit more on unique things that maybe we didn't before uh when we were you know you not that we didn't have Mobility at the position but M cirk was playing as well as anybody in this league uh you know really ripping apart coverage and attacking things and kind of running everything U Josh in two starts is kind of shown us U what Mobility you know in addition to what we do offensively can do for us um in this tough time where we're trying to overcome the loss of of a guy like Kirk last one yeah Kevin you start 0 and three you lose Jefferson you l cousins been in locker room where things looked like they were the sky was falling how are you guys in this position right now yeah the sky was never falling uh to those guys in that locker room I can remember vividly standing in front of them you know the Monday after we we did go 0 and three um and I can remember the message was I felt um you know all of us together included working forward to accomplish something special was one of the greatest opportunities uh we would have professionally U you know adversity truly if you look at it as an opportunity and you have your football team all looking Inward and trying to be the best versions of themselves for that greater good of trying to accomplish something special um I am of the belief that we can continue to go out and and uh Write Our Own Story and we're holding the pen there's a lot of challenges out in front of us we've got to laser our Focus like we've done each opportunity each day each meeting each walkthr each practice and when you do it the way these guys have um and we've got the leadership that we do uh my expect a is things will continue to be um you know what we've been thanks guys", "aigc_title": "Kevin O'Connell's Remarks on Vikings' Victory Over Saints and Team's Performance",

on a fourth quarter drive, with kicker Matt Ammendola drilling a field goal to ...", "video_transcript": "[Music] we are running out of superlatives in this Sensational campaign 30 to 27 the Texans win at Cincinnati and it got real interesting and dramatic down the stretch we're live from The Mattress Firm broadcast Booth as the Texans Come Away with back-to-back wins for the second time this season and raise their record to five and four adversity struck several times and they dealt with it and they've dealt themselves fifth Victory on the season with Arizona coming up next cocacola memorable moments there's nothing like football season and you watching and enjoying and listening to football with family and friends drinking ice cold Coca-Cola Coca-Cola together tastes better well Cincinnati got the ball first and they went 75 yards and 10 plays Joe burrow 32 yd touchdown pass to Trent Irwin Trenton Irwin and it was 7 nothing B but the Texans eventually responded with a 66 yd seven-play Drive of their own CJ strad going three for three on the drive and here was one of the throws one back Devin single ter here's the snap CJ looking throwing right side Dell at the six takes it to the goal line he's in touchdown Houston stoud to Dell for six 77 after Matt amendola's extra point and that occurred in the second quarter so tie game late in the first half and the Texans defense dealing in the first half by the way amandola 45 yd field goal and that was big probably giving him some confidence 107 at the break Texans up three they added a Chip Shot from amandola in the third quarter 13-7 and after a three and half by the Bengals the Texans went to work again a two-play drive big Pi on tank Dell helped the cause they got it down to the six and this happened first and goal inside the six St under Center CJ pushes the ball to single ter right side run and Deon is in touchdown Houston single Terry with the rushing TD his first as a Houston Tex and that made it 20-7 all right so Cincinnati you knew they'd make a run kind of like an NBA game everybody makes a run well they did they got a field goal to make it a 10-point game then they got a three and out by their D and then they exploded 64 yard touchdown pass to Jamar Chase to cut the lead to three 20- 17 would Houston be able to respond yes they did a 75 yd six-play drive and CJ strad decided to run it in himself on first and goal Stroud gets the snap CJ looking scrambling forward CJ on the run across the five he's in touchdown CJ strad the quarterback with the touchdown run and the Texans go back up two scores on Cincinnati that was a drive that started in the third quarter ended in the fourth quarter and built the lead back to 10 and along the way in the fourth quarter the Texans got two interceptions on Joe burrow you thought it was their day for sure but the Texans trying to drive out of their end of the field CJ strout on a bootleg play was picked off the ball returned in a goal too situation eventually Joe Mixon short yardage one yd run got the TD and it's a three-point game uh-oh Texans had the ball they had a third and three if they had gotten the first down the game would be over they couldn't get it had to punt back to burrow and guess what happened Cincinnati drove down field Texans eventually made a big stop field goal make was good by mcferson and it's a tie game 2727 but with a little over a minute and a half left for CJ Strat in the Houston Houston offense to get to work plus they had a timeout left in too Ryan's pocket well they got the ball and they drove stoud magnificent Noah brown big catch and run down to the 20 yd line part of his career day back-to-back games over 150 receiving yards for Noah Brown they got it down to the 20 and you thought are they going to be able to make this no fair bearon Matt amandola first game as a Texan could he do it let's listen 38 yd field goal attempt from the left hash mark for the victory for Matt amandola here's the snap here's the spot here's the kick plenty of leg and it's good the Texans walk off with a win in Cincinnati they take it 30- 27 Matt amandola at the buzzer it was beautiful to see field goal drive after last week's walk-off basically a walk-off touchdown drive this week the field goal ends the game by amandola and the Texans go to five and four on the season and Andre on the morning show of our Flagship Sports Radio 610 Sean Pendergast said this week we now have there's too much time on the clock guy and I think the Bengals would certainly Echo that that CJ strout is too much time on the clock guy for them they tie the game they left too much time for CJ Strat in this Houston offense they went to work and got the win were worried about uh about leaving too much time for Joe burrow mhm and all of a sudden they when they scored now it's too much time for CJ to lead to uh to go back and and put the game away couple of big plays Noah Brown I thought played outstanding football he has been the last few weeks I didn't know coming out of Camp because of some drops and you know unavailable because of injury the beginning of the Season well boy has he made up for the time that he missed early in the year he has come surging back how about this last two weeks for Noah Brown 13 catches 325 yards sweet that's insane and the Texans offense last two games 1,40 yards 69 points Bobby slowick has gotten in a rhythm uh especially the last two weeks uh there is one play that I might stay away from the third down in uh or three three or so late in the game late in the game that that uh to throw the tank throw the tank on the fade route because that invites CJ to go there if tank wins right away it's a lower percentage pass on third down and two and in very inviting for a quarterback because you're you lose the concept you have it going to the line of scrimmage but once the ball is snapped now you're just playing football and if something presents itself where a guy is open right away you're going to go there but that's not a high percentage pass in that situation so I'm might change that but I thought otherwise he called one heck of a football game talk to me about this Strat throws the pick obviously super costly but he shakes it off he's able to shake it off for that final drive to get the victory what does that mean what does that say about him well it says that there's growth there and that he's proving to be what everyone has said about him all along that he doesn't make the same mistake twice because on that play uh you don't go to the Crosser after you've already eliminated him and so that's a quick learning experience for him once he sees it on film that I was on him he was covered I went somewhere and then I tried to go back to him well he's out flanked me by then and there's not a throw you can make that you're going to get the ball there that led him into the interception an amazing day total team Victory you have to say that because you picked off burrow twice in your end those are burrow bullets coming your way they deflected enough at the end obviously burrow got the TD when you had the inter reception but he didn't get the final TD to put them in front he got it to Boyd Boyd dropped it they kicked the field goal the rest is history how about single ter today Dre 30 carries 150 yards at a touchdown that's going to strike up a lot of conversation right there that that's a Wally pip moment uh if there ever was one uh running behind this type of this line who has been now I said that they it would be better today because it's the same exact offensive line that has played together for 3 weeks now now consecutively so it's showed in the running game in in uh in motor production yeah you made that point in the pregame show so I got to think even when Pierce gets back that's going to be good for him it's good for anybody to have continuity on the line what about the sack situation our sack our HB sack report the Texans had four sacks in today's game how about Sheldon rankins coming back after missing a couple of weeks he gets three sacks Jonathan grenard continuing his special year uh leading this team in sacks he gets one sack that's a total of four as part of sacks for Hunger HB will donate $11,000 to the Houston Food Bank every time the Texans sack the quarterback the HB sack attack it's brought to you by HB the official tailgate headquarters of your Houston Texans 544 total yards fourth most in franchise history in a 30 to 27 Victory Jaguars lost today to San Francisco so they're six and three Texans a game back and they've already beaten the Jags once let's not get ahead of ourselves eight games left regular season three game home stretch coming up now we talked about Reliant power players of the game so many to highlight here but our featured player of the game happened to have a career day in the sack department and it was huge it's Sheldon rankins and John Harris catches up with Sheldon in the locker room here all right man it's a Victorious locker room in Sheldon rankins I wasn't sure I wasn't sure it was going to be victorious but then I saw 130 left on the clock and I know Seven's got it how are you feeling on the sideline yeah uh we understand if if if if a team going to give seven that much time he going to be able to process it get us down the field get us in position uh operating at a high level to win this game and and that's what he did it's no surprise to us we just understand that you know as a defense we just got to get him back the ball give him as many opportunities as possible to help us win games and he's going to do that before this week Joe bur called you guys a sound defense you think you guys delivered a message today how good your defense can be absolutely I think uh I think today we showed that for for for 60 minutes yeah we're going to fight scratch claw uh do everything within our power to to put ourselves in position to win games make plays and uh put this team on our back and uh and I think we showed that today but there's still another level we can take it to a level for you you went to today three sacks I'm sure you know this it's a career high for you you were all over the place you were making plays even there a couple plays you could have got sacks on they got one yard gains on it what was working for you up inside today yeah uh I just trusted my preparation through the week you know understanding uh you know I missed a few weeks coming you know know with the injury but just understanding my preparation through the week watching tape watching film study uh executing that plan and practice and then understanding that when you get in the game don't don't don't deviate from everything you worked on throughout the week trust in the process trust in the plan I went out there and executed at high level when amund doa's kick goes through the uprights what are you thinking Victory Monday Victory Monday you know absolutely you know coming into a hostile environment like this against a real tough team a playoff team a team that's that's fighting for Super Bowl you know this isn't a team that's just scratching to see how good they can be this is a team that you know in their mind they're fighting to play in the Super Bowl so they're coming to this hostile environment and uh fight all the way to the end to get a victory know seeing that ball go to the upright you know you're thinking wow we're we're putting ourselves on the map the type of team we can be the type of Team where we are and uh Victory Monday absolutely Victory Monday well I'll be working but Sheldon you can come in studio anytime my friend congratulations a hell of a game and thank you very much hey thank you for having me all right that interview brought to you by Reliant proud to be the official energy provider of the Houston Texans Reliant Dre quick note on the defense here because they were doing so well for most of this game fourth quarter got a little sticky of course the 64 yard bomb to chase that got away from them 64 yd pass that got them in range late in the game as well Texans handed them field position with the pick but what did you make of the defense overall and as they get people back should get a lot better yeah it should get a lot better but before I go there I I thought the defense had one heck of a performance they gave up some explosives in the second half they really hurt him uh the big pass to Jamar Chase got the Bengals right back in it quickly I think Tyler boy Boyd made a heck of a play at one point in time but when I listen to that interview one thing that really comes to mind and and we're talking about CJ being a rookie quarterback Sheldon rankings is a is a vet okay he is talking about his rookie quarterback in that manner in which if we get the ball we do our job and we give seven another opportunity we feel confident that he's going to get us to the promised land that is way a bunch of respect and mad respect way ahead of time like years ahead of time because you don't feel like that about your quarterback till down the road a little bit CJ's way ahead of the curb and and it's showing because of the respect that the defensive side of the ball and Veterans on that side have for him well the entire city is excited about CJ strout and Beyond the whole league is unless you're playing against him and the Bengals tasted some of that today with CJ strad constructing a field goal drive to win the game 30-27 Matt Amendola 38- yard kick at the buzzer a glimpse at the Cardinals who are in action now they're next for the Houston Texans primesport tale of the tape primesport.com for your VIP experienced needs and Andre Arizona up next and oh good Kyler Murray and J James Connor are back for the Cardinals and that is tough for the Texans next week we'll see how they do they're playing Atlanta as we speak but your thoughts on facing Arizona at home next week well my thoughts my initial thoughts are yes it's Arizona bring them on we need to win to go two games over 500 but I also caution fans that this is the NFL it is a professional football team and you still got a game plan line up give effort and go play them and not make mistakes because you saw that what mistakes will do will get a team back in this in the game quick that's the quickest way for an NFL team to get back in it no matter who they are uh yes Arizona's made a lot of Trades and dumped a lot of players at the trade deadline but uh it's still a professional football team that's going to show up and they're going to show up and play hard and they have Playmakers and Kyler Murray um Hollywood Brown Conor James Connor they've got they've got players so you're gonna have to show up and give the same effort so I expect uh NRG to be nice loud and proud and and uh root this team on as they uh as they come home next week you want to be part of the ride and it has been fun and stressful these last two weeks but each of the last two resulting in Victory backto back for the Houston Texans for the second time this season and as we are done here in the booth it's the flagships

the viewing area so pretty nice for a November day if I don't say so myself uh 47 out in Flora 48 Remington 46 renier 51 Attica Pine Village and Covington we got some 53s out in Peru sorry Peru and gram Air Force Base uh and then when we take a look at winds they are fairly calm we're 3 to four miles an hour across good chunk of the viewing area so current conditions we can still see the remnants of that Sunset right there we are nice and clear we will stay clear through that throughout the entirety of the night we're at 51\u00b0 the winds are from the southsouth East at 3 m hour and a very low due Point means we don't have to worry about any fog or any Frost in the overnight hours so take a look at the nighttime planner we'll be right around 48 by 700 p.m. 45 by 9 we'll drop down to 41 by noon or Sorry by midnight uh 40 by 3 a.m. and then 39x 6 this is all before that cold front has really worked its way through so uh temperatures are still a little on the high side we will see them drop even more past the 6: a.m. uh hour so winds will start to ramp up right as that cold front starts to pass through around the 2 to 3 a.m. hour it'll be around 11 M hour from the South Southwest but you can see that the wind is starting to shift and that's an indicator that that cold front has made its way through taking a look at tomorrow we continue the trend of being dry and having nice clear skies but we get down to 35 by 9 a.m. that we warm back up fairly quickly even though we have a wind from the Northwest the sun being out will help and not having any clouds will help as well be 53 by noon 60 by 300 p.m. and then 56 by 6: p.m. now taking a look at Future cast this is going to show we are completely dry over the course of the next couple of days as well as free of clouds uh Tuesday we we'll see a couple of clouds work their way in but we'll be mostly sunny uh all day on Tuesday as well we're getting to Tuesday right now you can see those clouds to the South starting to work their way back into the area but overall there's not a whole lot to talk about taking a look at the extended forecast though we can see Wednesday we are nice and clear as well Thursday we get couple of clouds that work their way in especially as you get into the afternoon evening but then Friday this is our next best chance of rain this will set up along a cold front it will not impact us for very long and it looks like it'll move out of the area very quickly so I'm not expecting very many rain uh very much rainfall totals out of that whatsoever and then after that Saturday looks to be a nice day Sunday looks fairly nice and then the system Moves In from the West that'll bring us true truly our next best chance of rain come next Monday so not tomorrow but the Monday after and this will impact us until Tuesday as well and with that cold air wrapping around the backside of this low pressure system man maybe we could see a couple of flurries it's still a little far out to tell for sure but in the 7-day forecast we're at 61 Monday 59 Tuesday 62 on Wednesday fairly warm highs and low lows then clouds work their way back in Thursday it's nice and Breezy uh 63 Dees as a high 56 Friday with a Chance of some isolated showers 53 by Saturday 54 by Sunday and then showers work their way back into the forecast Monday and Tuesday before we dry out again come next Wednesday now that's the day before Thanksgiving so uh looks like it'll be uh probably a fairly chilly one you think so it does right now but like I said we are still over a week out plenty can change during that time uh it looks it'll be chilly but fortunately it'll be dry it looks like and also uh fairly clear so it might be a fairly Sunny Thanksgiving as well well I just hope the turkeyy is not dry on Thanksgiving that's what I'm hoping for I hope to eat all the delicious foods watch some amazing football hopefully you know you never know these days um just you excited I'm excited I'm excited I go dark meat so that I can avoid the dry turkey but well that's all we have for our Thanksgiving chat", "aigc_title": "Evening Weather Forecast: Clear Skies and Steady Temperatures",

matter if you're on hag Lake if you're down Green Peter uh if you're up at mwin there are great opportunities that way as well these fish know it's coming and it's called winter uh and they will typically be very Cooperative as long as you can find them and I wish the Ducks would do the same thing but that's the whole other story real quickly though let's check in with Dwayne Dwayne's from long viw he's got a question about sturgeon uh we'll do the best we can to help him with that Dwayne what's going on hey not much hey Owen yeah uh fish on the cge quite a bit right now it's blowed out but I was talking to a fish counter and he said they might open the sturon fish in in January you mean down in the main stem of the Columbia below Bonville yes okay so well the very first thing that I'm going to tell you here when you're talking about opportunities to Target sturgeon so everybody knows you can fish for sturgeon year round but it is Catch and Release unless they have a a retention fishery in specific areas either it be the Estuary sections of the Columbia above Bonville whatever it might be you have to pay attention to those so don't let the idiot on the other side of the TV screen that would be me get you in trouble you need to look got the websites and make the phone calls to verify what and when things are open so to answer your question yes they are talking about a retention fishery below Bonville in February uh where that's going to be and if they've approved it or not I honestly can't say the only thing that that I know that they did approve is the fishery in Bonville pool uh after the first of the year uh above vonville uh for retention of sturgeon so that that's the only return retention season that I'm aware of currently now of course that can change quickly it's it's very difficult to keep up with their management of sturgeon uh it's ridiculous as that sounds it's true um but so the best way I can answer it is they were talking about an opportunity below Bonville for a retention other than the Estuary don't know if that's been approved or not really you got to go to to uh ODFW or Washington department of fishing wild wildlife's website and look at current updates it's easy to find both of their Pages has a big link right there on recent changes and once you click on it it'll give you all that relatively new info uh but the the fishery above Bonville has been approved uh so that is going to happen so if they are talking about that one that's yes if they're talking about blow Bonville not quite certain uh but again just verify before you go and don't let me get in trouble D thanks for your phone call partner we appreciate it uh real quickly though let's go to the river levels before we pull up uh Katie snea and find out what the weather's going to be nothing's really changed uh since yesterday everything's very stable my home river right here uh at 129 like I mentioned could be you know this week I haven't run the boat since I put the pump on so I might who knows just go run for a little bit see if I can find a ro see if I can find a rock that I didn't know about uh and who knows maybe find late silver wild silver running around uh the will smer same thing a little bit of a bounce yesterday with that rain that we had coming in uh I didn't really expect it to make that kind of a bounce but that is so awesome remember there are a lot of rivers in the North Coast that's a good one but some of the other options right now in those kind of conditions good night right here the selet another one great opportunity I mean you're talking some very good conditions with this up and down the fish are going to smell I mean you got so many things that are good right now uh moving along heading further south on thec another one very stable uh no real uh bounces that are expected to happen and and I don't see anything in the future that's going to change that the Halen by the way is almost a foot below uh its forecast which is interesting uh all by itself it hasn't really been getting that cold in the mountains to do that but we'll find out let's talk to Katie SGA and find out exactly what we can expect but before we get there here's your prize pack from procure thanks Ryan did everybody catch that I totally blew it and he just threw it in there uh send an email Jason atpr here.com tell you want to win and uh now you can see that that prize pack is all about winter steel head and uh yeah it's the kind of kick kit that you need uh to be a little bit more successful when you get on the river uh but Katie what can we expect I know that uh uh this morning I kind of followed along a little bit um but it looked like we may have a little rain in the forecast still or is it just going to dry out it's it's a little we have probably about a qu inch to a third that we're looking at tonight into tomorrow and then we have a cut off low which I'm I'm going to show you which could give us a few we call them wraparound showers Tuesday night into Wednesday our forecast our extended forecast is more dry than wet but we have almost by the time we're done tomorrow about 4 and a half inches for the month so far five and a half is our total we're not even halfway There Yet here's what it looks like up the mountain we had a beautiful sunrise this morning the sun peaked out just a bit and those clouds and the fog is mixing out a bit in the wamit valley we're starting to actually be able to see off that camera okay here it is this is is the trough that's going down and giving us this cut off low so here's Tuesday afternoon you'll see it starts to shift and move up just a bit and we have this right here which wraps around and could spray some water back up on us basically the way I call it is like a garden hose you kind of go like this not exactly sure where it's going to land but you know it's going in a general Direction that's what happens with these cut offs because some can go here some can go here that's our Tuesday into to Wednesday as far as today let's bring it back a little we get to tonight around 7 o'clock you can see a few showers they last all the way till around 10 o'clock tomorrow morning maybe a little Mountain snow I love that let's add that on to what we already have up there and then right there those are those wraparound showers that I was mentioning to you Tuesday night into Thursday how much are we going to get well that's what we were just talking about over the next three days at this point it looks like we could see right around 410 of an inch if we get that that'll surpass us into just a little more than 4 and A2 for the month and then that wonderful extended forecast the 7 day I mentioned a little more dry than wet and temperatures pretty mild at or just below average in the 50s overnight we cool back to average once we get through the middle of the week so you're saying there's no snow in the immediate forecast to the valley floor no not for the valley floor no we had a a podcast talk about that this last week at this point we we saw our first Valley snow I think the record is in like October obviously we've surpassed that and we're not seeing anything likely right now Katie have a great week thank you very much looks like it's going to be nice everyone if you do get the chance to get out there least the weather would be kind of nice but yeah I'd like to see some cold some rain again I'm a duck hunter that's kind of what we like anyway we're going to C to a quick break when we come back I've got Tony

to avenge what they view as the destruction of ...", "video_transcript": "I love those rocks yes they're my friends I've known them forever so I take it very personally when people def face them and put terrible things on them artist Holly flag has good reason to be protective of the picturesque rocks that Define the 400 miles of Rhode Island's rugged Coastline it's the view right outside the window of her third floor Studio in the home her family has lived in for Generations this was her childhood playground grew up there picniced there ran all over the Rocks know them like the back of my hand also I'm an artist so I really love the beauty of them they're just unique rocks raw natural beauty is the Bedrock of flag's work she's currently painting watercolors of nebula from images captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope this is mad butter why flag is also a graphic artist creating designs for the Metropolitan Opera and the Museum of Natural History in New York but when so-called street art spray painted graffiti began proliferating along the rocks in her Naran at neighborhood the artist saw red when you see somebody defacing them and writing their personal messages which they think are going to be immortal all over the Rocks it's really upsetting to me and I it's visceral flag was so outraged she took Justice into her own hands forming the citizens group anti-graffiti Vigilantes just lightly brush over it like this armed with only a brush and cans of latex house paint she started taking a swipe at what she views as crimes against nature but what might critics think of their attempts to obscure the colorful Doodles of others you see this as restoration of nature others might see it as destroying Urban art they say graffiti is an art what do you say I say go somewhere else and do your Urban art and some people do really fabulous art and uh I respect that I admired it just not in nature let nature be nature see what color you got that's looks good soon a small posi of like-minded volunteers took up the charge their restoration of these geologic gems requires wiping out the words and pictures in such a way it tricks the eye instead of just a cover up the Rocks magically appear as they once were I judge how close I am with the color that I've put on really the key to a good job is to just feather it in really lightly let the texture of the rock come through at first in an effort to be truly natural the anti-graffiti Vigilantes tried to clean off the spray paint with wire brushes even chemicals nothing worked because the Rocks were too porous the beach was too steep for sand blasting equipment so I know about painting and colors and Nuance so we said let's try let's try painting over it camouflage how did you come up with this technique of camouflage uh I didn't really think about it I mean it's just very basic how do I make this look like the rock there I keep adjusting my paint colors as I go along you keep doing it until you like the effect that you've gotten cuz the rocks are different some are Granite some are brown so you have to pick the colors yeah and you do many colors over one little area of rock you don't just say Okay this rock is gray here's gray get a big dry brush and you just smash it into the Rock I think it's more just feel than anything Joan pavlinsky is a social worker artist and Ardent anti-graffiti vigilante it's just a way of kind of making my own Mark by marking over others people's work if you think about what art really is it's Mark making you know and hopefully we're creating an environment so that it's not going to be you know vandalized again if we do a good job then they can't tell where it was so that's what we're hoping that as you walk around here you don't even think about graffiti it's just not what you came here to see volunteer Maryann cronley joined the anti-graffiti Vigilantes a decade ago spring and autumnn the band of Avengers attack rocks at places like this along blackpoint trail at Scarboro North Beach near the iconic remains of the 19th century Mansion Windswept itself the victim of vandals cronley says they gather tips from informants we watch for it you know and and we hear about it people tell us about it when we hear that it's down here we say all right well we got to get a crew together and come on down the anti-graffiti vigilantes go to Great Lengths to disguise the work of vandals sometimes hiking through outcroppings and sea spray just to reach their targets you have a large canvas you know a large graffiti canvas and you're like oh you know this is going to take forever you just there's like no way we can do this within like an hour or two it's done and you sit back and and you're I'm often amazed myself these before and after pictures are testimony to the results some photos we can't share because of objectionable words and images the last thing you want to do when you a hard day of work you're out with your dog you're out with your kid you're walking along the path and you see a large pink profanity like written on a rock you know it's like it just it just sort of just creates this energy that just drains you I think the anti-graffiti Vigilantes say those who come to stroll along the shore often voice appreciation and sometimes offer to help a lot of people say oh I'm so glad you're doing that they sympathize and they totally agree with how we feel and then other people are totally blank they have no clue what we're doing and they just think there's a bunch of weird people undaunted the graffiti Vigilantes keep chipping away true rock stars of rhod islands Shores it's with great satisfaction so as I step over some of the Rocks I can think ah we've been here and we did that one and we've done that one many times we'll probably have to do it again but it's nice to know that we were here and it looks better now I want you to be able to look at these beautiful rocks and not read things no words no images just say wow these rocks are really beautiful this ocean is beautiful and we're so grateful to have [Music] it [Music]", "aigc_title": "Rhode Island Artist Fights Against

malnutrition-related death by an Ocean State ...", "video_transcript": "I think it's our most basic need in life is is food and nutrition so without that we really aren't setting children up for um their best chance that they would have in life giving a child a chance in life serves as the compass for naven Salem she's on a quest to end malnutrition for children around the globe under the age of five and she's doing it here in a plant at quanta points industrial complex in North kingtown Around the Clock they manufacture these simple squeeze packets of a fortified peanut butter called plumpy nut the nutrient enriched paste doesn't need water or refrigeration and is easy for kids to feed themselves it has been proven to take a child from the brink of starvation to Salvation in just 6 to 8 weeks Salem named her company Adia which means Adia is the Roman goddess of food and so we thought that she really represented what we wanted to be and what we wanted to create here she's created a social Enterprise and what Salem has accomplished since founding edia in 2010 is astonishing running 247 allows us to deliver products through UNICEF the world food program and USA ID to 64 different countries so far we've been able to reach 22 million children and I always believe we're just getting started Salem got started when her four daughters now grown were all little girls the idea was born when her father brought her to visit his homeland in Tanzania where generations of her family settled after leaving India she visited a clinic like this one in Chad and her humanitarian Mission took shape as she witnessed heartbreak the first time that I saw a 2-year-old that looked like my newborn at home I realized that this is an incredibly urgent situation that is something that I could never unsee or or forget about it stayed with me all the time you tackled a world problem as a young mom with babies of your own how did you find the energy the willpower and the time to do it we're all busy um and we can make excuses for why we can't do things I thought myself now's not the best time to start a business but how can we wait how can this issue wait one more day or one more week without doing something to address it Salem has traveled the world seeing the transformation Plumping up produces first hand they have to eat one packet in the clinic in order just to prove that they can eat it other and they don't have complications after they've exited the severe program and they're in the moderate these children don't look anything like the ones that you just saw in in the severe acute malnutrition space they they are already being interactive They're laughing they're playing with you what's the magic in it it's it's fortified it has nutrients and calories and it tastes good I mean even if you're very hungry child the food needs to taste good because children no matter where they are they can all be picky UNICEF says5 million children under age 5 are malnourished and the World Health Organization estimates 45% of deaths in Children of the same age are linked to malnutrition Salem says the crisis is being fueled by two things climate change and armed conflict climate change is causing droughts years long droughts and floods that are catastrophic they're biblical right like we've never seen before so this is forcing huge amounts of people to migrate new conflicts are rising every single week also forcing migration I have seen children take their last breaths but Salem says while addressing climate change will take time addressing the politics of hunger at the United Nations security Council this summer was Swift and direct her briefing how to combat malnutrition we control the conflicts we right here in this room just as we decide to wage war we can decide to end War you're literally sitting around a round table with Russia and China and and all the powers of the world and your job their job our job is how do we create World Peace really trying to get across the humanity of it that we're not looking at statistics you know we're talking about real lives that are affected yeah we seen the entire operations and um it's it's a much more bigger role Andrew Kamar Vice President of Operations at Adia was once one of those affected by Rebellion his family had to flee Sierra Leon during its long Civil War my two sisters and I ended up in Guinea West Africa as refugees so we had to learn how to survive how to stay resilient how to fight um to really make it another day I think that experience prepared me for the work that I'm doing today I felt like um during my many many years of uh leaving in in a refugee setting and seeing suffering human suffering hunger and starvation and malnutrition and all kinds of uh difficulties that folks were going through in that part of the world it prepared me to stay focused how you doing man and Kamara is not the only one working here who has lived that experience Adia staff of 100 includes workers from 25 countries many of my colleagues have been through the same path as me they've lived in refugee camps they were once hopeless not knowing um where help was going to come from and today they're in a position of um giving back to those same refugee camps um they take that job very seriously there's no giving up here folks come in they would start the shift fired up they would end the shift fired up no matter how tired they are because they see the result of their work and the impact is making globally there's a life is saved for every time you produce a [Music] box Camara views each package as a box of Hope the plumpy nut inside provides meals for two months enough to rescue a severely malnourished child these could be your children these are our children these are the world's children and we all have to be part of the fight to give them a life that is full and naan Salem is also concerned about children here at home idesia has developed a plain peanut butter packet there's a need for protein and something that was easily distributed and ended up Distributing it through food banks and school lunch programs across the US there's a lot of people in the US who are doing that though and there's not a lot of people who are supporting and just um planning for Yemen and Afghanistan and while her main focus is International Salem is always seeking ways to expand programs for all children she says it's not about treating malnutrition preventing is the priority currently Adia is creating a new plumpy nut for pregnant women meantime Salem continues navigating everyday challenges to to make a world of difference I have some words on my door that say find a way like we don't have the luxury of saying H this isn't working so well today because yes we're going to get interrupted everywhere on a government level a policy a a war zone that a truck's trying to get through pirates in Somalia you name it we've had it right but how do you get around that and how do you make sure because every minute counts it's pretty powerful to be able to take something that you made and understand that it's traveled Halfway Around the World to a child whose actual life

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, discusses the House issuing subpoenas to Hunter Biden, James Biden and Rob Walker for testimony ...", "video_transcript": "joining me right now in this Sunday morning Futures exclusive is the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee Congressman Jim Jordan Mr chairman thanks very much for being here today you bet what did you learn from David Weiss that we need to better understand well well it most certainly was a denial because he asked for it in the spring of 2022 and he wasn't given it and he asked for it the timing I think is important Maria because he asked for it right before he went to the US attorney in the district of Colombia to ask about partnering with the District of Colombia us attorney and I asked him specifically I said when you ask to partner with another us attorney what does that mean he says partner in Prosecuting the case so he asked the US attorney the District of Columbia can you partner with me to prosecute Hunter Biden in the District of Columbia and guess what years that was focused on guess what that charge was was was going to be that was going to be the tax years that dealt with the barisma income and the US attorney told him no and at the same time before he goes there he asks can I have special attorney status and the Department of Justice turns him down that to me is hugely significant because the barisma years where all that income coming into Hunter Biden that t that statute of limitation let they let it expire and I think it expires because if they go there that takes them right back to the White House right back to Joe Biden well I mean I want to get your take on where we are in this I know that you and your colleagues have sent out subpoenas uh this past week around this story for Hunter Biden uh other family members tell us where that fits in in terms of the impeachment inquiry well overall understand that the I think the large context is this is this is a tale as old as time you got a politician who takes certain actions that benefit his family financially and then there's an attempt to sweep it all under the rug which is what we're investigating on the Judiciary Committee how David Weiss handled this investigation and we know they tried to sweep it under the rug because of two Brave whistleblowers who came forward and gave their testimony which by the way Maria that testimony has stood up under cross-examination from the Democrats and the oversight committee every witness we've deposed has confirmed what Gary shapley and Mr Ziggler told us so that's what we're looking at but then we have these additional subpoenas that went out this past week to Hunter Biden to James Biden to Eric Schwan I want to talk to Kevin Morris I want to talk to the guy who paid Hunter Biden's taxes just come out of the come out of nowhere paid paid all this tax uh burden that Hunter Biden had I think there's a number of people we need to talk to we will continue to do that and and as we build this case as we look at this case and gather the facts well if the doj has been covering all of this up for so long then why wouldn't they cover up the subpoenas I mean will they get in the way of those people actually coming forth and talking with you on the record no I don't think so I mean uh everyone else has come forward we've now in Judiciary Committee we've deposed seven different people who were involved in the investigation of Hunter Biden I think they will come forward and we will get that information um so I do even ABY LOL said he expects Hunter Biden at some point to come tell his story I think was the words that that Hunter Biden's lawyer you used so I do believe they will come forward and we will we will gather that information I think the Crux in the matter is still the barisma income understand four Central facts Hunter Biden gets put on the board of barisma fact number two he's not qualified to be on the board fact number three he is asked by the barisma executives to weigh in with DC to relieve the pressure that the barisma this Ukrainian Energy company is under five days after that Joe Biden goes to Ukraine and starts the process to fire the prosecutor and he uses our tax dollarss holds up American tax dollars that was already approved to go to Ukraine he holds it up to accomplish that that I think is the central focus and then you have the investigation where they're trying to sweep it under the rug they let the statute of limitations expire for the very tax years that deal with the barisma income that's coming in because I believe they didn't want to get back into this issue and Joe Biden's actions that benefited his family because his family was making money off the brand as Deon Archer Hunter Biden's business partner told us the brand was what they were selling unbelievable how long will this take tell us what your expectations are in terms of this in investigation and will it lead to an impeachment of Joe Biden that's driven by the facts I believe we will get the the the depositions and the interviews done in this calendar year and then make a decision early next year whether there are actual the evidence warrants going to articles of impeachment and moving to that that stage of the uh of the investigation but I think this year November December we will depose all these people we still need to depose uh and then we can make a decision I I'm most concerned I think over Biden's handling of China given China's goal of overtaking the United States as the number one superpower and is he compromised in terms of making the right decisions uh for America's national security based on money he's taken from Chinese Communist party members well we'll see I mean look that the CFC this this this company that sent money and then that's where where this $40,000 check came from We're digging into all that as well uh again we're D we have a constitutional duty to do oversight we're now in the impeachment inquiry phase of our oversight Duty um we're driven by the facts we're driven by the evidence not by the politics like the Democrats are when they attacked president Trump not just with their impeachment four years ago but with all these other investigations that you you just talked about the one in New York uh which is all driven by politics and out to get president Trump we're driven by the facts we're driven by the evidence and we will continue to operate in that fashion well the timing is important we've got an election next year president Trump is facing four indictments uh and you've got this dereliction of Duty yeah it's h look I I I think the best line I think was what president Trump said earlier when you uh when you had that clip on yeah he said they come after after him because he's fighting for us that is true that's what the swamp does they're going after president Trump cuz he kept his word and he's fighting for us con real quick before you go margorie Taylor green is going to bring to the floor impeachment articles against Alejandra mayorcas are we to assume this dies in the Senate what happens with Alejandra mayorcas after 7 million people have come into America uh apprehended on his watch well we'll see what happens Tuesday when that resolution comes up I'm not sure if it's tabled if it passes whatever I would support it uh I mean I think I think this guy's done just a pathetic job and we know the million tubs come across we asked this question in a hearing a while back of all the million come across how many have went through the adjudication process and actually been removed and of of the several men only 6,000 people have actually been removed that's how bad it was and this is also the same guy who when he was asked how many people have come across who were on the terrorist watch list he said well I I don't know I'll have to get back with you a year ago that was his response so it's been terrible we know the situation we'll see what happens with the resolution on Tuesday and and two years later we're worried about another terrorist attack in this country Mr chairman will be watching your work thanks very much hi everyone I'm

Rachel Phillipson what a treat we have for you on this Sunday afternoon as you can see I'm joined by UTEP head Ben's basketball coach Jo golden coach thanks so much for spending some of your Sunday with us great to see you again Rachel always know when I'm seeing you this closest to the basketball season so obviously excited to be here with you thank you so much so two games into the season of your third season at the helm of UTP and starting the season 2 and 0 I know they haven't been against the toughest opponents but it must feel good to kind of start the season this way yeah we got off to a good start obviously uh against two opponents that were nonis One games but it was good for our guys we have a bunch of new players that got the opportunity to put on the uniform play in the bright lights and play at the at the dawn so there was a lot of positives to that and everybody that says that we can't score the basketball this team's obviously got off to a good start and was able to score the basketball a little bit and and have a lot of fun with each other but uh you know there's some obviously some things that we can take out of those games but um moving forward as we navigate the schedule from here on it gets much more difficult I don't know about school a little bit coach last year we talked about scoring was an issue and this year you put together two games first back toback 100 plus games since 1968 and 1969 you've had uh 17 guys or 15 guys sorry in double digits in those two games what's been the difference from last year this year yeah obviously the opponent has something to do with that but but to get to the score like that you have to do some things right you have to make shots and we were able to make a bunch of three-pointers and we were obviously able to get out and transition and get easy baskets I think we had 33 assists the first night and 26 or 27 the second night so uh you know I like that I like the the the fact that the ball's moving we have multiple guys in scoring and I also like the fact that we got to play a bunch of guys right our depth was was important to us coming into the season we got the opportunity to play a lot of guys a bunch of minutes we'll see what happens tomorrow night um you know in the game I I still think we'd like to play 10 guys uh tomorrow night maybe even possibly more uh but obviously some of our veterans and some of our new guys minutes will get extended a little bit but uh yeah obviously being being after last year when we when we were one of the worst three-point shooting teams in the country and worst freeto shooting teams uh in the in the country to be able to see the ball go down is obviously uh makes me happy you talk about tomorrow night and a massive massive game over at the Don UC Santa Barbara coming in a team that's gone to the tournament twice out of the last three years what can fans kind of expect from that game yeah you know we we didn't really uh talk to Joe he was having a hard time scheduling we were having a hard time finding a home opponent and so credit to him uh for for coming down here uh to play us at home and then we'll return the favor to him next year we'll go but uh you know we have a ton of respect for their program to your point they've been Nate tournament two the last three years won 27 games last year have three starters back had the player of the year last year um he actually didn't play uh the other night but we fully expect him to play uh tomorrow against us so they're very well coached they they've got high level transfers and again guys back and honestly that's where we want our program to get to right is where the success that they've had over the last three years is where we're trying to get you to and to get there you have to challenge yourself against those opponents and so uh it's a great opportunity for our team to play one of the best uh teams in college basketball at home uh then the national television just makes it even better right and I think that uh you know the people on TV understand that uh the dawn is great when there's people in there and we're going to have a great crowd in there tomorrow night it's going to show great on national television and obviously have a great opponent in and we're going to be challenged and we're going to be a better basketball team coming out of it so it's going to be a great night you talk about having a lot of people in the D tomorrow night it's being talented as the 915 game just explain a little bit about that and how fans can get the tickets yeah it was obious say marketing campaign that we started last year that uh you know we're kind of 915s team it's the area code uh around here and so uh we want to embrace this city and we're not only utep's team we're the city's team as well and so to do that we came up with a the marketing slogan and then each year we get to pick one game which is a 915 game um that we kind of help Market a little bit more

postgame press conference following the LA Chargers ...", "video_transcript": "the outcome wasn't what you expected but what can you say about the effort of the team especially when you see Keenan Allen going back into the game how is firing about that yeah there's a lot of fight in this team uh you know obviously not the outcome that we we would have wanted um but those guys didn't quit you know offense defense special teams they gave everything they had all four quarters um and we fell short so it wasn't good enough today um but I I don't question the the effort the the dedication by this team at all now scored 38 and 34 at home and lost what's the frustration level right now when you keep on the offense keeps doing the job um we play as a team you know there have been games where we haven't put up enough points and there have been games where um you know we put up some points but we play as a team we win and lose as a team and um all three phases um you know we believe in each other we we believe in this team this this coaching staff um it didn't happen today um there are definitely things that we could have done offensively a lot better in the first quarter um so there's a lot to look uh watch the film and get better at the first half was kind of different story than what most of the season has been we made good adjustments and we really good after every scoring last five possessions in in the second half um something you can build on moving forward with the how you play after halftime yeah I I think there are some good things that we can take away from this game offensively um you know I thought we moved the wall well in the second half and being able to convert and um you know get those third downs and and score points in the Red Zone I think that's huge and we just have to do our best to eliminate turnovers and that starts with me and um you know that first quarter we have to be better and I have to be better as as a quarterback um but there are definitely things that we could look um you know to look forward to building off of for mck came back and made that play in the fourth quarter after having the shorter issue just you talk about just how how hard he plays and how badly he wants it even you know a decade Plus in he's an incredible player uh the teammate the the player um you know he he does everything he means everything to this offense and to see him battle and fight and go back out there um you know he leads by example and he's an incredible teammate qu Johnson scor his first touch today how has that relationship kindr what did you like from him today yeah uh you know I thought he's he's stepped up big time in the past couple of weeks um you know whenever you lose a guy like Josh Palmer and Mike Williams someone's going to have to step up and replace that and K's done a great job picking up the offense and and we know how special and how talented he is um it was only a matter of time to to get him the ball and something special will happen just on was that kind of a fun game to play in knowing that you know you're coming back they scor it's like a basketball game they they score you come back yeah well losing's never fun but uh you know I thought uh we battled today you know and there are a lot of good things that we can look at this film and and say you know what we we can build off this but there are a lot of things in the first quarter that you know we didn't do a good job of and I didn't do a good job of in the first quarter and um if we're not fighting back maybe maybe The Story Goes differently and so th those are the things that we're going to look at when we watch this film and realize hey you know at least we turned it around we did our best in the second half but if we're not put in that position if we're not if I'm not turning the ball over in the first quarter um you know maybe the story looks different do you feel like sometimes you just don't have a margin of error given the number of close games you guys have been in I think that's the NFL um you know you can't afford to make mistakes and expect to be able to win games like that and um you know it's an awfully good team that we're going up against in the Lions you know they're a very good team offensively defensively special teams um and you know I can't make mistakes like that and expect to just be able to come back and win games like that you just have one two lost two one two how do you maintain consistency and not continue that Ro coaster for the second half uh we take each week as they come you know it's week by week and and we we understand that we've got a tough task this next Sunday um and we have to do everything we can to have our best week of practice not let this one affect our next one um and do everything we can to learn from this one and move on Justin you control only what you can control but what did you see out of your defense today uh a lot of battle you know they they're tough and we believe in those guys and and we've got complete trust and faith in them and we know how special they can be and um you know it didn't go our way today and and that's the the tough part about the NFL is you know offensively we've been there before where hey things aren't going our way um but I don't question or doubt them for a second I know how special they are they're they're coached well they've got some incredible players on that side of the ball and we stand behind them 100% um was the no offense was that something that's born out of necessity today or part of the game plan um I think maybe a little bit of both uh you know having to come back like that you know offensively not being able to move the ball in the first quarter like that you know I think it's one of those things that we looked at and said hey if we get on the ball and um you know maybe we can start scoring some points like that uh we can cut the deficit a little bit going back to the wide receivers um a long road back for Jaylen but to get his first touchdown today how special was that yeah it's awesome you know he he's battled so much over these past couple of years and and we know how special he is and um an awfully great teammate too uh you know I've really enjoyed being able to play with him and work with him and um you know it's never easy coming back from an injury like that um but he's he's done all the right things and I was really glad to see him score today Justin was this loss particularly disappointing at all because of the way you had been trending with with two straight wins and dominant wins yeah I think every loss is is is tough to to to go with um you know it didn't go our way today but um you know there's nothing we can do now to change that outcome all we can do is watch this film tomorrow get our bodies back do everything we can to attack next Sunday and some of the like guys on defense were talking about how they felt like the loss was on them and they told a bunch of the guys on offense that it was on them what were you saying to those defensive players if if any came to you or what would you say to them if they came to you saying that exactly what I just said you know we we believe in those guys and it's a team game you know the NFL is tough winning these games are are very tough um and it takes all three phases and we offensively we weren't good enough in the first quarter we put ourselves in a position like that and you know kind of like I said earlier if we're not scrambling like that maybe the picture looks different so it's not all on the defense it's on the offense it's on the Special Teams uh we win and lose as a team would you say there's a bunch of stuff you could have done better in the in the first quarter what are the things that you're referencing uh turnovers converting on third Downs you know there are some third Downs that we'd love to have back um you know I threw a pick that I'd love to have back as well but uh there's nothing we can do about that now second half you get pushed right by Hutchinson complete one across the field to to Quenton and he got back up and pointed made the first down signal right and Aiden he was right next to you did you know he was there that just a little bit of little bit of fire trying to get every fired up or was it more coincidence than he was right next to you uh it's em it's an emotional game um you know I think that was a big part for our offense being able to convert that third down I didn't have realize that he was right there I meant no disrespect by it I know how tough a competitor he is I got a lot of respect for him so I didn't mean any disrespect by that and uh running on short third and one fourth and one wasn't working between the tackles today is that something the lions were doing to to stack it would maybe missed blocks you could see it pretty well from where you were what was leading to the lack of success in short yardage situations uh you know they got a good front seven uh we have to be better up front and uh you know I thought we did a good job running the ball today um you know we we had our opportunities to to be able to run the ball and I thought OS Kelly they ran the ball really well up front um those guys pushed they made their they made their stand and you know we we really believe that uh we we've got a great offensive line a great running back group that if we do have those third and short fourth and shorts we believe in them um didn't go our way but I know next time we're going to fight for it and today's loss you guys fall just under 500 and just looking at the standings and it being the Midway point of the Season How concerned are you with your guys playoff uh we're just one week at a time you know we've got a good Packers group coming up next week so uh we're do everything we can to have a good week of practice and look forward to that game", "aigc_title": "Justin Herbert Discusses Team Effort and

emphasizes Israel's success against Hamas as key for worldwide stability on ...", "video_transcript": "hello America I'm Mark lvin and this is life liberty and lvin we have a special guest former ambassador to the United States from Israel Ron durmer he's also the Israeli strategic affairs minister and War Cabinet member a very close Confidant to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcome Mr Ambassador great to be with you mark it seems to me here in the United States the better the odf is doing the more Israel and the IDF are under criticism from the American Media the better the IDF is doing the more people around the world are rooting against Israel and the better the IDF are doing the more I don't want to drag into politics in America let me just say the more hostility there seems to be against Israel now I don't want to leave the impression that the American people feel this way absolutely not the American people I deal with want you to kick butt and kick it as hard as you can and as fast as you can but that said do you get that impression in Israel well you know I said it Mark from the beginning of the war that everybody stands with Israel when we're a victim the question is will they stand with Israel when we're a Victor and that's a very different conversation and we're dealing as you know with a brutal enemy that not only uh attacked us in the most horrific way uh on October 7th which was given the size of our country was the equivalent of about 2911 kidnapped 240 uh hostages uh in in the wake of this brutal attack and you see as we go and we go in to actually win against this this brutal enemy that is deliberately targeting us and using their own people as human Shields as you know they have an entire Terror tunnel Network underneath Gaza it makes it very hard to prosecute the War and what their plan as you know Mark is they want us to go in and civilians they're keeping as human Shields and they're hoping that when Israel unintentionally targets doesn't Target the civilians but what unintentionally harms those civilians and those civilians are killed that the whole world will turn against Israel because that's what's happened before and instead of blaming those civilian casualties on Kamas they blame Israel and they call for ceasefires they called for us to uh to end this uh this war against Kamas but we're not going to end the war against Kamas we're not going to agree to ceasefire just like you would agree to a ceasefire a month after the bombing of Pearl Harbor a ceasefire with Japan or after 911 you'd agree to a ceasefire with your enemies Israel is going to prosecute this war until Kamas is eliminated this round round with that we've had in Gaza as you know many rounds over the last decade or so this round in Gaza is going to be the last round we're going to eliminate hamas's military capabilities we're going to end their political rule of Gaza and we're going to ensure that Gaza never poses a threat to the people of Israel again that's the mission that we're in and the country is United behind that mission in a very powerful way and whether there's people uh in the United States or in Europe or elsewhere that doesn't want Israel to win too bad Israel's going to win we are going to finish off Hamas and in doing so it's not just going to be a victory for Israel it's going to be a victory for all the forces of peace and moderation in our region as you know Hamas is part of an access of Terror that begins in tan they control Hezbollah in Lebanon they have Shia militias in Iraq that are attacking you they have houis uh in Yemen that have attacked us and they've attacked Saudi Arabia and they have Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza and they have terror militias all over the world there's this AIS of Terror and they want Israel to lose and on the other side there's Israel there's Saudi Arabia there's the United Arab Emirates they're all of America's allies in the region and it's very important for us to win because when we win the forces of peace and progress win and if we lose which we're not but they want us to lose if we lose that access of Terror is going to grow and it's going to be a threat not just to Israel it's going to be a threat to your uh moderate Arab countries in the region it's going to be a threat to Europe and ultimately it's going to be a threat to the United States that access of Terror Mark I told you begins in tan remember those people in tan they refer to Israel as the small Satan they refer to the United States as the great Satan they're leading chance of death to America and death to Israel so in actually winning this war in Israel against Hamas we're actually protecting America and we're protecting all the forces of civilization around the world and I know people who are on our side and there are many many as you say throughout the United States and throughout the world they're pulling for us to win and we appreciate the solidarity and support and we are going to win and we're going to win for us and win for all the world you know Mr Ambassador I'm a little perplexed even before you folks are done uh there are countries like ours like mine that already has decided how a post Gaza territory is going to look who's going to be involved a two-state solution I imagine this annoys you a little bit you may not voice it that way those are Israelis who are losing their lives their blood is being poured into the sand in Gaza seems to me Israel should have some say on what happened since Israel took that territory after they were attacked by Egypt in the first place and gave it to the Palestinians so really a two-part question here number one do people understand that terrorists really aren't interested in managing a state a country what Hamas wants what Iran wants what Hezbollah wants is a caliphate that's why they're in all these other countries that's why they're trying to topple these so-called moderate Arab countries and these moderate Arab countries under their breath really want you to defeat Hamas and they really want you to help take on Iran so they don't lose as you were just saying their own countries so that's number one and number two what is this idea that the International Community or one country or another except for Israel gets to decide the fate of the Gaza territory well look Gaza is not a we're not in a war thousands of miles away where you would be in Afghanistan or Iraq or somewhere this is literally hundred hundreds of yards away from uh from Israel it's right across the border uh and so obviously we're going to have to make sure that we don't have a force that will emerge in Gaza after we finish the war that could possibly threaten Israel we're not going to allow the world to just decide what's going to be in Gaza because we can't have what happened on October 7th happen again so we're going to be involved in this throughout uh the Prime Minister said that Israel for a long time is going to have to retain overriding security responsibility and a lot of people got upset about that what he was saying is I think the most obvious thing in the world we have to be able to ensure that a terror organization does not reemerge in this post Chamas Gaza we're going to get rid of Hamas we're going to get rid of Islamic Jihad but what's to say that two years from now or four years from now or 5 years from now 10 years from now 20 years from now that we're not going to have a new Terror organization emerge there and who's going to stop it who's going to go after the terrorists and kill them so you see what's happening and your uh viewers may know about Judea Samaria and the West Bank you see you have a Palestinian Authority there they're not stopping terrorism there Israel has to go in on the ground Israeli troops have to go in to cities like Janine and tabis to make sure that we're rooting out terrorism there so there's no question that Israel is going to have to retain overriding security responsibility for the foreseeable future as for what we will see in Gaza the day after Hamas that's an interesting conversation we'll have to have that with our partners in the United States Arab Partners in the region and around the world and there's a lot of different opinions about that but I'll tell you a mark what we're not going to have as I said we're not GNA have Hamas we're gonna have to have a fully demilitarized Gaza and here's another point that I think is critical Gaza has to be deradicalized we cannot allow any Force there that's going to educate the next generation of Palestinians to hate Israel to hate Jews to hate America by the way as well we can't allow that to happen so we have to look into the schools you have to look into the Moss you have to make sure that you don't have a media and and a cultural environment that is just poisoning the Next Generation and the best historical example I can give you for that is what happened in World War II where the United States had a decisive military victory over Germany and Japan uh and they put in place different regimes there and ensured that the next generation of Germans and Japanese would not be poisoned against the United States and today Germany and Japan are two great allies of the United States what we have to have is a real change in Gaza a real different future for the people who live in Gaza for the Palestinians who live in Gaza a future that can put us on some path to ultimately reaching a peaceful settlement of our conflict uh that has not happened in the last 30 years it hasn't unfortunately there were Great Hopes with the oso process that this was going to happen there was hopes that if Israel simply withdrew from the territory which we did 17 years ago in Gaza and Israel withdrew all our troops from there that somehow peace would emerge it's not going to emerge and after October 7th Israel is not going to roll the dice uh with the security of its citizens and we're gonna have to ensure that in Gaza there is going to be whatever the structure will be that will be decided after the war we're going to have to make sure that there is not a force there that is building and building up to ultimately attack Israel and I I tell you something Mark there are a lot of people who are not hopeful I I am actually very hopeful because I think we were living under this illusion that somehow this would all work out somehow if you keep talking about a two-state solution something good will happen about it we have to deal with a real problem of what Young Palestinians are learning what they're teaching in their schools you know you see dipl diplomats around the world and they go from this Capital that capital and what did they say about the peace process it doesn't matter look at what a young Palestinian is is learning in school looking at what a young Palestinian is seeing on their television screens that's going to determine the Next Generation and I think October 7th has put a lot of clarity into this process and right now Israel has to defeat Hamas completely eliminated from Gaza and then build something else and I think in building something else we have hope of a different future for is is for our security but also for Palestinians and for all our partners in the region you know the Abraham Accords that were done just a few years ago that brought real hope to the region well we have other potential Partners like Saudi Arabia as well and I think that if we if we have a decisive military victory in Gaza I think the next step will be to actually hopefully to expand peace between Israel and our Arab neighbors and I think that's possible but it will definitely not happen without a victory iory uh in Gaza a victory in Gaza against Hamas will be a blow to that access of Terror led by Iran it would be like this Iranian octopus losing an arm and the second blow would be a peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia and I know it seems difficult to see that today but I see a clear path towards that future and it begins by defeating Hamas in Gaza well you say many very important things there one of them I think especially so as you're talking about the culture if you lose the culture you lose the country and if you can change the culture you can save Society we have a cultural issue in our own country as you no doubt have seen from Israel what's going on in our universities what's going on on our streets what's going on our media it's quite disgusting uh not the people but the ruling class Elites the mouthpieces for the elites uh they Embrace this cultural rot that's happening in the United States so it's very important what you said about changing the culture because you can't change the polic

Sunday, November 12, 2023.", "video_transcript": "we have both of the big Christmas trees you know the one at Jackson Square and Spanish Plaza I noticed today oh they're already out there they're out there see this is what I'm saying we we need some time okay cuz who's going to get it together decorate it all up I know you got to give Thanksgiving it's time get the beans greens potatoes and tomatoes together it's going to be exciting yeah okay but the weather will it be nice we we're not even that far yet you know what yeah for early next week we might actually have another rain system moving in oh we need that rain yeah we do and we need just like you say not just one event but we actually need several of these kind of events to get us out of that exceptional drought level that we are at for our entire area almost which I'll show you in a second but here is the big headlines heading into the next couple of days first of all rain yes it's finally going to happen and we may get a decent amount in fact we might get several inches especially near the coast we're talking about mostly Monday and then Tuesday I think will be the rainiest day but actually even into Wednesday depending on what happens we will will see at least some showers but really the bulk of the rain I think late Monday and Tuesday we're talking about maybe 2 to four plus inches of rain but maybe even closer models are indicating maybe near four or five or maybe even close to 6 Ines near the coast a lot of this would be very much appreciated and needed uh and it doesn't look like we'll have any flood watches to go with this much rain because it looks like our soil will be able to take this much rain as it's going to be spread out over a couple of days at least and by the way severe storms we're not expecting that in fact we may not even get that much lightning or thunder at all mainly this will just be rain it looks like spreading into our area from that system now getting into tonight really quickly we're in the 60s we've had a dreary kind of weekend with those clouds kind of interesting and feeling a little bit different our winds now coming in from the north and Northeast and we're going to be seeing those winds up as this system moves in so it'll be a breezy to windy setup in the next two to three days your wakeup forecast 60s cloudy and cool and you may want to throw an umbrella in your bag or have a rain jacket ready to go for later in the day because it will gradually move in during the day and it might even be toward afternoon and evening for some people I'll show you in a second temperatures tomorrow staying mainly in the 60s for high so that coolish feel will be there notice the morning somewhat dry only a couple showers around but by noon we're starting to see a decent chance for a few showers and then if you're out later in the day after work in school there's a much higher chance to get rain and it looks like tomorrow most of it will be light but we may have some heavier rain moving in later at night everything quiet right now but we're starting to see this rain really getting into much of Texas which has had some rain but also could still use a little bit more we're seeing some start to move in south of our coast and a surface low will be developing around here pretty soon and then moving south of our Coast so moving into our Precision cast once again 8:00 a.m. tomorrow couple of showers but I don't think it should be too bad and it looks like although visibility may be limited a little in spots doesn't look like a big foggy setup widespread for early tomorrow morning this is tomorrow afternoon you can see starting to see the showers move in this takes us to 600 p.m. and then on into Tuesday this may be the Rainier day a good chance to see rain and look at this some of this heavier rain firing up near the coast on Tuesday this is by Tuesday evening some heavy downpours will be possible but again a lot of this will just be in the form of light to moderate showers and this is by Wednesday a slow moving system still bringing a few showers into our area Wednesday the purples and reds are indicating two plus Ines of rain and we may see again the highest totals near the coast we are under exceptional drought conditions in the dark red here so we really need the rain we're still running about half or so of our normal rainfall that we would have at this point of the year when you just look at averages it would be 56 in we're at about 27 in and by the way this is from the river forcast Center an outlook on how much rain is needed to end the drought and they're indicating for most of our area probably near 10 plus inches of rain would be needed so even if we get a good soaking with this system we really do need more now one more thing as we know when we get these East Winds prolonged for a couple of days we sometimes see the coastal flooding so Monday evening through Wednesday night there's a coastal flood watch looks like especially at high tide which would be at night we may see the tides running higher than normal and that would be a coastal flooding concern for those of you on the east facing Shores here's your forecast as you make your plans again Tuesday the main rainy day although late tomorrow also will'll have the rain maybe some showers Wednesday and then we're warming up and drying out toward the end of the week but we may get another rain system early next week so we may get a little more rain to help us out", "aigc_title": "Anticipated Rainfall to Alleviate Exceptional Drought

{"doc_id": "0pdGTKrO", "video_title": "Right On The Money | Full interview with career expert Robin Ryan", "video_description": "\"America's top career expert\" has some advice on how to improve your resume.", "video_transcript": "if you can first will you talk a little bit about since we were just talking about it the job market right now it has been on fire uh through you know much of the late stages of the pandemic and yeah relatively speaking it has been slowing a little bit but that's relative it's still pretty hot by historical standards um what people don't realize is that it was like you said it was flaming hot and in my career never seen it that like that ever so if you had a pulse you could get a job and it slowed down so it's more normal okay it it isn't like it's a bad Market you're never going to get a job I think the hardest thing for people who got hit hard especially those in Tech was it was always so easy for them to get hired half the time they were recruited they did not have to do anything and now all of a sudden I got to write a resume I got to look for a job you know I got to start Network oh my think about that so it's no longer just so it's no longer just if you have a pulse you get the job now we do have to try a little bit and that is of course where your expertise is just you know you're dripping in expertise on that so let's get into that for people you know who maybe you know didn't have to rely that much on their resume over the past couple of years resum\u00e9s you know that's that's how it all begins uh it may be time to redo that especially if you haven't done it in a while well most people are not very good at resume writing the first thing that they ignore is ATS applicant tracking system that's where your resume has to go through it's like a a big filing cabinet in sky that the employer uses so if you're using colored ink or headers or Footers or columns and tables that system's not going to see them so the first thing is understanding what that program is that system and how to be effective getting through it the next thing is it's not about job descriptions Jason it's about results outcomes what were your actions and what were the results did you save money did you make money um did you decrease or save time right so there's all of those kinds of things and numbers speak more better than some or you know a few uh numbers are more important especially like if you supervise say 20 people as opposed to supervised team more powerful and you've handled a budget of X number of dollars and that sort of thing so you're saying in those bullets underneath you know when I tell you you know where I've worked you know I've worked for ex employer now I need to get in there and instead of saying I had great work ethic I was a selfstarter i you want to see what did you actually do Jason like what important things have you done what results have you gotten right biggest mistake we copy our job description and paste it in there no results there got to have results got to be able to outline how you use those skills because they want to see do you have them and how will you use them with us speaking of job descriptions um okay so we see job descriptions when we're applying okay uh we've got to get through this applicant tracking system that you talk about it's this big you know bot gatekeeper essentially do we need to be including some keyword words in the resume itself that may have been listed in the in the job posting yes but but not like stuff it because people just like copy everything and stuff it better to have a list of say summarize in a couple sentences what you did and say responsibilities included and then you have a few of those keywords but think about it if you're a project manager I need to see a bullet about that you know manage numerous projects from beginning to end right if you're telling us that you know you're good with Finance you know analyze you know the general ledger to determine you know budget variances whatever it might be I think that that's kind of the mistakes people make the other thing I find too is when you look at the job description and you see 100 requirements they all don't matter the same so typically the most important ones are first make sure you address those so and distill that down a little bit um you know while we're on the applicant tracking system here for just a moment uh if I could I've seen some people who uh Advocate putting a QR code on their resume is the applicant tracking system going to like that no no yeah people do the dumbest things they also like make these very very beautiful looking creative colorful resum\u00e9s that are never going to be seen because the system doesn't recognize it so ditch all the graphics there you also have mentioned this and I I never thought of this before um you have a preference on what platform I should be doing this on whether it's a word or a PDF explain that a little bit a lot of the tracking systems don't read a PDF correctly so a word file and let me make a caution a lot of um younger people have a Mac and so and they may not have word they may have something in the cloud it needs to be a Word document so when you save it you must save it as Microsoft Word that's what the systems recognize so don't use a PDF The Only Exception would be that the job application required it interesting okay great piece of advice there uh I have to ask you about cover letters though now because I I always have traditionally written a cover letter uh we know that for some years here in the pandemic you know you didn't really have to do that you know you're alive you're hired you know uh talk a little bit talk a little bit about what you've been hearing because you actually plug in with people who are in you know hiring uh roles at these big companies and they have thoughts about cover letters oh yeah it can be very influential if it's well written and the one thing hiring managers always tell me I see that as your true communication skills because I know people can help you write the resume but very few people will get help on the cover letter it's not needed in every single job the tech world doesn't look at them doesn't care about them you don't need to use them but if it's a nonprofit job an executive leadership job something in education um there areas where you can really point out more of your skills perhaps you're in marketing or you're in sales and you want to drive home some of the things you've done nonprofit fun fundraisers definitely want a cover letter because you can hit really quickly on some of your biggest accomplishments and you can also add in some extra information personal information oh I had that experience or I did this or I'm really passionate about you know raising funds for that charity because my family member had that illness so those are the kinds of things cover letters as I said could be very influential they should be written so that they are quickly scanned so not 100 paragraphs I have seen some come through with an education they're four pages no one's goingon to read four pages so you know put in what you've got to say and if you want to hear a really bad one the the longest resume I ever seen was 28 Pages two pages two pages Max folks two pages Max the older you are the longer they get okay so wait a minute when we talk about two pages Max though now I've got to drill down on it a little bit more do you do front and back no two pages flowing document I know most of it's digital anyway people over 50 okay people over 50 people with executive jobs but those they don't realize the emphasis needs to be if you're you know 50 to 60 on the last 15 years and particularly hit hard in five to seven because that's where you look at and say well this is the most relevant this is their latest experience this is the latest level that they're at right but um if you keep it lengthy number one nobody's going to read it and number two you're going to look like a dinosaur so not a good idea you don't want to do that I you know I I tend to run away from things that you know on first glance it looks like a long read I start running uh because who has time anymore for that but this does if you do write a cover letter doesn't it also give you the opportunity to yeah make yourself shine and kind of put your voice in there a little bit but also to maybe you know don't go crazy but sprinkle in a few more of those key words from their job posting correct and um the other piece of it is to the extra attention to detail you're going to go the extra mile you're to do a little bit more so if I hire you for that job you're not going to be average I can tell right now you're going to do it in above average way that can be powerful too so you may think it's you know unknown but it is I saw uh in one instance that you had spoken with someone and uh I thought this was real interesting they said said that they always notice if someone writes a cover letter they also notice when they don't write the cover letter and they said that there have been instances you know put the resume over here on the side there have been instances when they have actually reached out to someone just based on the cover letter that's 100% correct I talk to HR people recruiters all the time I'm in all kinds of groups with them we have conferences we do big online sessions together and they share very quickly what people do wrong and what's influential and so just the things she pointed out that if it's well written and you point out the things we need pick up the phone and call you or nowadays we send you an email or we send you a message on LinkedIn uh they have also uh told you that they don't want to see a cover letter that clearly was sent to a hundred different people it looks like a form letter yeah no form letter nothing generic and don't start out with oh I saw your ad on indeed and I'd like to apply for it open with a powerful sentence that says I have six years of experience blah blah blah so that you capture my attention very quickly because as you said it's only glanced at it is not read word for word neither is a resume no resume is read word for word either they really don't spend much time uh Hye managers do they on on your resume you put so much work into this thing and it might get what seconds yeah the the initial glance is usually 15 to 20 seconds and if you don't capture their attention with something they want to see one of the things that I always include is what I call a summary of qualifications it's very close to the top and it's four to six sentences of what youd bring to the job so it summarizes your skills and experience pointing out the most important things to doing that role if they read that they slow down and they keep going that's probably the biggest thing I get feedback on is that most people don't write one or if they do they write it in first person like I a very versatile and reliable worker nobody cares what we care about is how many how much experience you know I've got eight years leading large projects right that's the kind of thing that they want to see so write that summary near the top there and put in those specifics and those results and keep it succinct uh let's talk a little bit about you know because you touched on older workers here uh and I really want to get into that too because you know during the pandemic it seems like a lot of people who may have been you know dealing with we all know it happens age discrimination out there in the workplace uh they may have dealt with that but during the pandemic whoa uh suddenly people want me again because they need people right now well you know we might see the pendulum swing back a little now talk a little bit about what an older worker needs to do because you've seen this Robin where you look at a resume and you go oh my gosh this thing is just screaming I'm old and out of dat so I just want to address the marketplace in 2020 and 2021 a lot of employers offered retire packages they were good ones they had money and the unwritten message was if you don't take this you're probably going to get Lo let go anyway so a bunch of people saw themselves flooded into the marketplace the next thing that's been happening is since since November I'm starting to see more people losing their jobs older more Senior People obviously tech people but in sales and HR those areas got hit too and a lot of the HR people are older a lot of managers are older so they're over 50 I'm hearing people between 50 and actually 64 that are still looking for a new role age discrimination unfortunately exists so number one chop your work history down on your resume 15 years don't go back farther than that drop your college degree if it was before 2005 so you don't want anything that shows that more than 20 years be careful about technology technology is not what you used to have so we don't use things that are outdated for example we don't want to see Hotmail or AOL emails we want to see Gmail we want to know that you know how to use slack or you know how to use Excel and that you you you emphasize also how have you stayed current what classes have you taken what conferences do you go do you follow thought leaders those things are really important and the last thing if you're a manager you've got to show that you're coachable as a manager and that you build a collaborative team the world operates in collaborative teams the days of its my way or the highway is long gone that's interesting and and so then you're showing that you are still malleable you're still adaptable you're still able to work with all age groups that's correct and remember too you have to be open to ideas from young people our Innovation comes from people under 30 and that is why it's important to build that collaborative team and call on each person and listen to ideas and have them build from each other because during coid one of the things we were losing is some of that Innovation when people were talking on Zoom zoom and they weren't you know talking at the water cooler and sharing some ideas or being able to say hey I can't figure this out in the computer can you help me as opposed to having to wait eight hours for somebody to send you a solution I want to close here by talking to people on the other end of the age spectrum and those are the people who are new to the workforce uh you know some of them all they've ever known is this incredibly hot Market where you you know get a job like that you get multiple offers you can jump jobs easily it hasn't always been that way no and and the new College glads this year are like how come I'm not hired five months before I graduated because they aren't doing that right now yeah it's an expect you have to know what you want you know you can't just be like well I like a job you know I don't maybe in marketing maybe in Communications may you have to be specific you need a job title I also think too that the jenzy and some of the Millennials that are under 30 they haven't seen a tough market now some of them did in 2020 because a lot of them you know lost their job then but they looked at it differently because it was a mass layoff across the country and they were getting unemployment they were getting extra money um so it's shocking to them if they get laid off now and they're not prepared they don't have an updated resume they haven't understood the importance of networking and building a good um network of context use LinkedIn to become friends quote unquote with anybody in your field so look for managers or recruiters that might hire nurses and Link with them that's the first thing the second thing too is LinkedIn is really important and pretty much uh a lot of people just ignore it you can't do that this is how they find you and be active you'll see in your feed some you know employers putting in a job description that looks like something you could do and want to do so the other thing I think that happens is when they're a new college grad or the first Year's out they're not clear where they want to go so here's my advice look for a place with a good manager and it's going to give you some good training that they're that you're going to be able to grow and improve your skills because you're really raw and if you want your career to move fast take some certifications Maybe it's in project management maybe it's in e-commerce maybe it's in design but these will add to the education you have corsera that is a online program offers all kinds of programs and courses and certificates very reasonbly priced from the top university professors in the country I highly recommend that as a source if you need new skills and employers want to see that especially if you're you're brand new that you you know you don't have a ton of experience but boy you sure have racked up some varied skills here uh in in what you've learned think about this most of them don't have internships and if they did they weren't they didn't have a lot in it but if you were able to take some extra coursework that's relevant to where you want to go that is impressive to an employer and enough for them to say oh well maybe we should talk to this person um I'm going to uh as part of this link to our conversation before about LinkedIn uh because I think you had some really great info on there about you know the proper picture that you know how to fill out the you how to fill out your profile but I do want to ask you because you've made it a a real point to tell people turn on the open to work Notch there on LinkedIn so that people know that you're looking I don't do that with higher level professionals but people that are especially people under 30 um even under 35 it doesn't hurt and if a recruiter sees you they'll know okay this is a person who's actively looking um on LinkedIn I made an eguide it's off my website it's free it takes you from the beginning to the end every single section don't ignore LinkedIn people have a skeleton they put in maybe a job title the employer you're missing ways to get in important things you accomplished in keywords so a recruiter or hiring manager could find you and they LinkedIn looking for talent so it's important to be there I have a couple of more questions about younger workers but real quickly while we're on this if I'm an older worker and you know I've chopped down my resume to only show the most recent 15 years do I do the same thing on Linked In yes okay and we only want to see things relevant to what you're doing now so if you're a CFO we could care less that you were accountant 20 years ago it has no relevance and that you waited tables in college yeah uh so no we don't need that too uh back to the younger set here though you you you you lay out what is sort of the ideal size of your network that you should have there on LinkedIn how many people you should be connected to and you say that a lot of younger people are falling way short yeah what I do is I follow their lead and they say the best network has 300 to 500 connections it is not uncommon for me to see new grads come out or people with you know 26 or younger with 30 maybe 50 some have zero some have three um this isn't going to help you it's an algorithm and it needs to be active you need to have a big enough Network so that that algorithm um will find you fancy talk for um it's how it works and so it goes through if you're more active you move up on the algorithm so more people can find you you if you're inactive they don't see you at all uh another um website that you have really uh talked a lot about here and because I think a lot of younger people too you know like anyone they don't really know where to go to look for jobs you know it seems like there's so many different sites you've mentioned glass door specifically talk a little bit about why that is glass door focused on jobs for people with about five years or less experience it knew when it was creating the site that you know indeed in LinkedIn had captured the higher level market so I always recommend that you do three things look at glass store look at indeed right look at LinkedIn and then make a list of companies you're interested in and go directly to their websites large companies are going to have you know hundreds of more jobs on their own website than you're ever going to see on any of those search engines so don't miss those opportunities if they're not there and you don't know about them you can't apply so that's why it's really important to have company websites as a part of your search plan um I I wanted to ask you with regard to LinkedIn and with a resume you know is there a a time frame as to how often I should be going in and just you know maintaining updating my resume and Linkedin even when I have a job I'm gainfully employed I'm you know somewhat happy Etc should I be going back from time to time and what is that time Peri period and and kind of sprucing those up once a year and a couple months after you get a new job you can at least on LinkedIn put down where you've been hired and you know a broad sentence about what you're working on there that would be the biggest thing the mistake that I see yesterday I worked with a gentleman he's a high level executive 12 years ago he updated his resume he had nothing and he lost his job he knew knew it was coming he waited until it happened and I think that's the other big mistake there's usually warnings many times you've been told your job's in danger why do you wait till it's if you're let go there's no reason to wait till you're actually laid off take that you know whether it's four weeks or two months start actively looking make sure that resume is great start looking at the right jobs do not apply to everything young people will make that mistake they'll say I apply to 80 jobs and no one responded resume is a problem there's the first thing right and you're not being discreet enough you're not looking for something you're really qualified for many times they they want more experience than you have or you're all over the board you're applying for 15 different types of job titles and you know and the resume doesn't have any relevance to most of them it's it's okay to stretch a little bit isn't it though I mean if you don't match all requirs about 80% if you've got 80% and one of the mistakes I think that um people coming out of college make is they say well I don't have any experience but that isn't necessarily true because if you had an internship then that's experience so a lot of times looking at that you might be able to say well this person was a research assistant at their University and there's an a a year or two years of experience so right in that summary I would put new College you know marketing graduate with two years of professional experience because that puts you in a little higher category and employers do like to see internships they're really important if you're in college absolutely make the effort to get some uh when you talk about people who wait until the last minute to try to look for a job you know usually again you at least get some warning sometimes that something's coming for you specifically but you can also read you know the writing on the wall at a place that seems to be struggling and having some trouble and you can see that you know maybe we're going to have some job losses here um get moving on that as fast as you can because wouldn't you agree Robin that uh it is much easier to land a job when you still have a job I agree from this reason you get depressed you get discouraged you get desperate and that is all apparent in the search process the other thing too is if you're in a company and they're laying some people off do not believe anybody that says oh you're fine oh your job will be okay especially if it's your boss because if you go boss is probably going with you so if something like that is happening update the resume look for something cherry pick make sure it's something you really really want and pay attention um employers are still paying high salaries so there are still a lot of carrots and good reasons to move and not necessarily just because you're in a panic but because the salary will be significantly more than what you're making now especially if you've been in the same company for a long time Robin uh I I really appreciate uh what you do and how you do it and I it seems like I'm constantly stalking everything that you write I mean it's just it's it's smart stuff and it's stuff that I think a lot of us are just not very good at so thanks for you know putting it all out there and for taking the time with us here you're welcome I care very much I my whole career has been to help people find jobs and get a career that they enjoy and they find satisfying that that's the most important thing is to really love what you do", "aigc_title": "Navigating the Job Market: An

{"doc_id": "0pdGTQuW", "video_title": "Hindalco Industries: India's Aluminum, Copper Demand 'Very Strong'", "video_description": "Satish Pai, managing director of Indian metals producer Hindalco Industries Ltd., discusses the demand outlook for its products ...", "video_transcript": "saes good to have you with us when you take a look at aluminum demand it was pretty strong in the first half what assumptions are you making for the coming quarters I I think that you know from a demand perspective if you look at aluminium there the demand is extremely strong I think that you know whether you take the beverage can or the packaging Market the auto driven by electric vehicles Aerospace driven by you know everybody's traveling uh the only sector that is sort of going flat for us is building and construction which is obviously because you know of the interest rates that activity has slowed down but for out of the four sectors three are quite strong the demand and I just wanted to add the Indian demand is amazing I mean it's growing at 10% so very strong aluminium and copper demand in India does the upcoming election add to that growth well it's true that during the election time a a lot more infrastructure spend happens which is generally uh very good for uh Metals so yes it helps can you quantify that please saes no but I mean the the run up the election is sort of middle of next year and right now quarter on year on year every quarter the aluminium demand is up in double digits so you know 10% growth normally in India uh coid times and a little bit before it was about 7% cagr today the growth is 10% going on every quarter so we are already seeing in India a very strong demand so dis you know we've seen copper prices about 15 16% down since middle of January right now you know how does that affect your business and you know looking at aluminium ahead here you what do you see in terms of price and I want to just get to Copper because copper must surely you know have a big big role to play looking ahead with the demand really perhaps going up exponentially being so important in EVs and other modern Industries so we that's the real Paradox in some ways both aluminium and copper we are in a situation where Supply demand is tight forward-looking demand every quarter looks good but the commodity prices of both aluminium and copper are quite subdued and very range bound and I think that's happening and as you were talking on your own show Chinese economy and what's going to happen with us interest rates these two you know depending on what comes out in the news the prices of aluminium and copper go up and down in a very volatile sense so it's very strange that the U macroeconomic sentiments are sort of having a dampening effect on what is actually a very buyant demand market for both aluminium and copper so I think you guys are the sole and major producer of copper in India now adani is planning to start production of its new new plant next year how do you see this whole industry and the structure of it evolving uh with new capacity coming on and you know copper of course say so important for the world's energy transition yeah and I think you know you have to remember that the uh one of our smelters of vanta actually had to shut down so we are actually shot on copper cathodes which are now being imported in from many other parts of the world so I think that you know having another smelter coming in is good for the Indian economy but where we are focused is going up the chain from cathodes to wires to rods to uh inner group tubes so our strategy is at the same time you put money into Upstream we are heavily investing into value added Downstream in Copper as well Sates you have a strong balance sheet you're looking to grow organically what's a plan specifically so if you look at our capex plans they're pretty aggressive I mean Noel is we have a a 2.7 billion Green Field plant that is you know sort of 30% through in Alabama in India we have just announced a 2 million ton Upstream alumina Refinery so you know we have committed nearly 4 to 5 billion that we going to spend over the coming two to three years so quite strong uh organic growth plans that way any key projects within India itself so within India the the the one that we recently announced was a 2 million Greenfield alumina refinery in odisa and the second thing is we are going to announce a big uh exclusion press to meet the demand of the Indian railways for aluminium coaches so that's those are the two big ones I would pick saes what you you think about doing other metals getting into other Commodities here as well just to expand your portfolio you want essentially be a dual play or mainly a Jew play yeah I I think that you know the part that we are going to be uh working on is what we call the associated metals that come in the concentrates so I I'm going to run through a number of them so from the box site residue we are working on gallium and vadium from the copper concentrate besides gold silver we are going to try to take out rare Earths so the concentrate chain which had quite a lot of these what I will call critical minerals is where hindalco is going to be investing in so saage how would you do this would it be through something organic that you started yourself or you know obviously with your balance sheet it probably makees sense for you to be buying other players so you going to get in the m&a side of things no actually you know in this type of rare Earths and things like that there's not too many people that you can buy the Technologies are sort of just coming out so we are working with some of the expert companies that are in this field to set up new facilities I mean we just announced a large copper recycling and the copper recycling is actually dealing with E-Waste and other types of copper scrap which besides copper gives you a lot of these other uh interesting critical minerals so that's the way we're going to do it", "aigc_title": "Hindalco Industries Reports Strong Demand for Aluminum and Copper in India Amid Upcoming Elections", "aigc_article": "Explore the robust demand for

{"doc_id": "0pdGWfJA", "video_title": "Sunday Sit-down with Mizzou wrestling coach Brian Smith", "video_description": "Read more: https://abc17news.com.", "video_transcript": "welcome back everyone it is Sunday sitdown time we got missou wrestling coach Brian Smith joining us for Sunday sit down thanks for making some time I know it's a busy time of year coming up for you guys oh it's an awesome time of the year though the best time so kind of tell me about this group this year you know what are you excited about who are you looking at this year to kind of maybe do some big things well we return five all-americans so it's the most all- Americans we've ever returned so the experience level I think we figured it out we have 38 years of experience in our starting lineup on for that's the thanks to co but uh just lots of Talent with Keegan OU and Brock mer and the elim brothers and Payton moo those are the all- Americans and then you fill in the Noah cerons and Josh Edmonds there's it's a good nucleus of the makings of a really really good team well you have that much experience on your roster you know tell me what it does especially for those younger guys that I know you able to bring in some Talent there to have that much experience though it's uh I always say it's a love and a hate for to be a young kid in the room right now you love it because the experience and the knowledge that they share with the young guys but then it's also the beatdowns that they share with them in the practice room so it's hard on the younger guys for that but it's going to make them better it's going to and I see that I saw our guys compete some of our younger kids compete this past weekend and they got out of the room and they were doing great things like Carter mallister and Owen OES all winning the tournament I don't think they had gotten a couple takedowns in the practice room over the past few months so it was in enable for them I want to talk about a guy like Carter M mallister coming in from Rockbridge you know what did you see from him over his high school career and you mentioned you know now he come in and having some success with you guys so what have you seen from him to start he just loves to wrestle and that's an important and compete you know he got in the room right away with us and he had been coming to our Regional Training Center cuz you know he's allowed to and trained with us for the years but then when he finally got to practice with us he he just loves it even on his tough days you know it was really tough on him he's coming back and wanting to get better and grow from it and that's what succeeds at this level if he wants to be great at the division one level that's what it's going to take talk about succeeding at this level keano tools I think the the definition of that you know going and competing on the world stage tell me you know how awesome was that to see for a kid like Keegan yeah that's his second time on a world team and he's two for two with Golds which is uh not easy to do and he's also third on the Olympic ladder right now so he has aspirations to make an Olympic team but for having a young man going overseas winning gold medals your teammates that work out with you and he's a leader on the team see that and they're they're getting to practice and be around a guy that is special and I've been fortunate to coach some special young men through this program like a Ben Asen and a Jaden Cox and others and and it it definitely permeates through the room that positive that growth mentality that just you know and greatness MH when you have a kid like Keegan who's you know won a national title he's won these gold meds and kind of go into a season with a Target on your back right how have you kind of seen him take that in stride since he's had the success yeah I I mean coming back last year I think he realized that after winning it as a freshman and then last year struggled a little bit with it but then figured it out and now it's just he's more I think he's more focused on you know helping the team win a National Title and him win a hodge which is the comparative Heisman so that's what his goal is and he wants to go out there and get better every time and keep dominating opponents which he's been doing last year the NCAA championships another top five finish there you know what was your biggest takeaway from last year for you guys probably fell a little short of what our goals were and lost some really tight matches didn't score enough bonus points that this year that's what we've been working on since like the week after NCAA is focused on those little things to get better so we can win a team Trophy and have a chance to win a National Title when you talk about those type matches you know how do you get over that hump and to get on the other side with a win and those some of it's mental so we do a lot of we every Monday we have a mental Monday and break into groups and do talks and get guys stronger mentally but it's also maturity they've been there they've done that most of these guys have been to the National Tournament two to three to four going on their fifth time like a a Brock merer and so it's uh they they will have that confidence and they have a room that's preparing them and they have that real strong mindset that they're going to go in there and do great things and that's that's the belief of tiger style right well I know season's obviously right around the corner before we sat down here we're talking you guys are doing a pretty cool event coming up here to to teach people about wrestling kind of tell me about that well it's the women of tiger style so all the coaches wives and our trainer and other people that are the women that are the backbone of the program always get asked about you know I don't understand wrestling and that's why I don't come so this is your chance you can come out out uh Wednesday November 15th we're having uh an event where it's in the columns Club at missou where it'll be learn about it's wrestling 101 for women so it's a social hour so it's going to be more social than it is going to be wrestling but I'm allowed to come in at a certain time and bring a couple of my wrestlers and do some uh teach teach some about the scoring and how the matches go and it'll be a really good time for the community to come out and support our program and the women of the program and learn some wrestling well that's going to be awesome stuff to kick off the season right after that you guys get going in your season kind of tell me you know what do you think about this schedule this year tough schedule for sure yeah I don't I I put it together so I might kick myself later but uh we open up with Arizona State you know our tournament this weekend but then Arizona State's our first duel meet and they're I think ranked sixth or seventh in the country we're in the two three fours in that area so it's going to be a big big duel I know we' sold a lot of tickets have a lot of people coming out again and we love that atmosphere so come out but uh it's it's going to be a great week with that and plus all our alumni are coming back right now we have close to 80 to 90 former wrestlers coming back so Ben Asen and Drake hesel and all the greats are coming back plus all all our other guys that are were you know participated in wrestling even guys from the 60s and the 70s so it's going to be just a great weekend for you know from starting from Wednesday all the way to Sunday with the duel just uh great things going on with wrestling what can you say about the atmosphere of the Hearns we were also talking about this before you know it seems like it it just gets better and better every every year you go in yeah we closed the season with that dual meet with Iowa State last year and there was close to 6,000 and just it was it almost sounds like the roof's going to come off when Noah pinned his guy and then Brock mer pinned a guy so we're hoping for that with Arizona State I love the Hearns it's the loudest building we have you know I I just think when you get a lot of people in there and we have this great team at just the excitement and our athletes feed off it I know that I I watch Noah certain when he's usually the first to go out there he enjoys it and has a good time with it you know we were talking you're entering your 26 here now you know does it feel like that's flown by it all to you it does you know when I I look back at when I started which you know I'm the only coach that's been here when Norm Stewart was coaching and it's a lot of changes but the excitement that's taking place at missou right now is fun you know what desire has done with the just the the energy she's brought to the athletic department and then football and basketball and all these uh volleyball all these teams that are doing you know kicking butt on the field or on the courts and it's exciting you know we're going to have a great team but when you have other sports doing it too it makes it fun and just seeing how Missouri is the state of Missouri fans are coming back and embracing the sports programs it was a hard time through Co but seeing what's happening now with the sold out games and record crowds at basketball and for us and gymnastics it's it's a it's a great time yeah obviously you've had a lot of success at mou you know when you look at things you want to do here still what's the next step you're may be looking at with this program do you ever think about that still all the time we want to win that you know our we've been in the top 10 eight straight years now so we don't want to just be in the top 10 we want to win a National Title so that takes you know it's going to take a great tournament at the end of the year but we can do that and you know that's the B of the program one of my other personal goals is to someday walk into the Hearns and have a match and it be sold out that would be really cool that this program has been so successful but to have the M you know the missou fans come and pack the place we might have to pull the the the the the curtain back on the dle things but you know the seats there but that would be a lot of fun to sell it out and have a big duel there maybe with Oklahoma State at the end of the year right well I'm looking forward to seeing you guys this season thanks for making some time for it thank you awesome for the rest of you guys we'll be right back after the break", "aigc_title": "Sunday Sit-down: A

The guest is Toby Kinkaid. Solar energy powers our ...", "video_transcript": "[Applause] [Music] Aloha everyone and welcome to Hawaii the state of clean energy my favorite state I'm your host Mitch Yuan our under writer is the Hawaii energy policy forum and that's a program of the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute I'm pleased again yet again to welcome our guest SOI concade our true Pioneer in the Solar industry who I've known for what almost 35 40 years going no not quite 40 years but a long time and uh he's he just got over coid and he's a real champ he should have been a Submariner because he has a real get up and go attitude which I love so welcome to the show uh Toby and we're going to uh we're going to delve into your history with solar and you have a lot of knowledge about the solar industry I mean you form most of it I think um but we're gonna have a brief history of the solar industry so Toby over to you and um I think a good place to start is just uh to start it off is tell us what is solar energy anyway just is a background to get us into into the subject sure well all of the Ancients knew that the whole world is solar power so it's a very intimate thing but back in the day everyone kind of thought solar energy was one thing sunlight actually that's kind of a misnomer it really should be called sunlights so back in in time let's go back to uh 1666 Isaac Newton famously painted his dorm room Black black the windows were all black and he scraped off a little bit of the paint so a little beam of light could come in and when he was developing his work on Optics he would put this prism in and he'd say oh that's extraordinary sunlight isn't one thing it's seven things red orange yellow green blue indigo violet and this was an extraordinary thing because now sunlight was many things and it had a lot of int well when Newton developed his optiques he really taught us there two kinds of Optics geometric optics where the wavelength doesn't matter and physical Optics where the wavelength really matters so in geometric optics for example if you had a reflector you might have heard of angle of incidence equals angle of reflection well that's true no matter what the wavelength is but when Newton put his prism there and and and refracted those lights out oh my goodness all of the different colors that really kind of was a GameChanger and that's physical Optics where the wavelength really matters so if you take a stick and put it in a glass of water and you see it Bend that's the different wavelengths traveling through water at different speeds so Isaac Newton kind of opened the door that sunlight is far more involved than simply one thing well then we fast forward to 1799 and Sir hersel Sir William hersel climbed a mountain and he wanted to duplicate Newton's experiment so he put up a tent cut a hole in it had a beam of light go in put a prism there and he had a table and he had his red orange yellow green blue indigo violet and what he wanted to do is is ask the question hey do each color do they have different temperatures so he started putting thermometers on each of the colors kind of kind of interesting well he brought more thermometers than he needed so he put a few off to the right and started making his measurements and then famously he kind of looks over and notices oh my goodness beyond the red where there shouldn't be anything all of my ther are hot what's going on what's this and he said there must be something in the Solar Spectrum which we cannot see but definitely has a lot of energy and he discovered infrared so now the seven colors of light became eight so then In The Same Spirit Johan uh Ritter said okay what about the other side is there some energy we can't see on the other side of light you on the Violet and so he took some photographic paper very early on which is just paper in silver chloride and they noticed if you put that in the sun it turns black really fast but if you shine yellow light or red light or blue light or green light it it it wouldn't uh turn black very raply but as you move towards the shorter wavelengths towards the blues and the Indigo and the Violet it would accelerate and turn black faster and faster so I thought okay I'm going to repeat the experiment of of sir hsel and then I'm going to put some of this photographic paper Beyond The Violet and see what happens and lo and behold it turned black and he goes oh my goodness there is energy in the Solar Spectrum shorter than the violets what we call now ultraviolet and this now turns seven eight now we have nine things in Sun wow well it's a really kind of an amazing Optical soup of all these different colors well there was a big mystery in the 1800s they just they knew about ultraviolet light and when they were experimenting with electricity they would shine it onto some metal and they noticed that electricity was formed now when they shined red light and orange light and yellow light and blue light nothing happens but when they shine ultraviolet light on metal suddenly electricity is happening and they're like what's going on W no way to understand this and the whole mystery wasn't solved until 1905 and in 1905 Einstein published these five papers the special relativity general relativity couple of papers on Browning movement which is how atoms would drift around but his fifth paper changed the world and that was the photoelectric St and what he pointed out was and this is his famous equation that if you can see it on the screen uh what he said is the energy or measuring in the electricity the kinetic energy of the electrons is going to equal the energy of the photon minus Fe and Fe was the working function of the material it's kind of the resistance of the material so he def light as HF the energy would be plunk constant this really small number times the frequency so the higher the frequency the higher the energy and this turned out to be absolutely revolutionary now there's kind of an analog in music so if I make a tone if I have that higher tone what's happening well I've doubled the frequency so the ancient Greeks knew for example if you took a string stretch it tight and pluck it you get a sound Dum then if you pinch it halfway and pluck it you get B an octave higher you doubled the frequency so this was kind of a really important realization that every color of light contains more energy and the higher the frequency the higher the energy now this turns out to be the father the turning point of not only solid state physics and photov voltaics making electricity directly from sunlight but this is the of all of our modern solid state devices all came back to Einstein's equation where everyone thinks of eals MC squ but you know that's esoteric but as as far as this equation of the the kinetic energy of electricity equals the energy of a photon minus the work function of a material that was incredible and so he set up the basis now for how a photovoltaic cell works and what they do briefly is they they take two sheets of silicon and they they diffuse some Boron on one side and on the other sheet they put some phosphorus NOW Boron has one less electron than silicon so relative to Silicon it's more positive and then with the phosphorus it has one more electron than silicon so it's more negative and when you put the positive and the negative the p and the N Junction together you have a solar cell and what they do is they put some grids some wires on the top and on the back and you connect a wire from the front through a light or some load to the back and Einstein tells us that because silicon for example has this work function this band Gap they call it of 1.1 electron volts so Einstein's saying if you want to make electricity anything below that below the red light longer in wavelength you won't make a single electron but if you get above 1.1 electron volts hey you're going to start knocking out electrons and so Einstein really gave us our modern world with this photoelectric effect now we've got this amazing spectrum of these it's not sunlight as one broad band Spectrum that's not quite accurate it's actually a collection of these very narrow bands and now with all of this together we can do three major things with solar energy with the longer wavelengths we could do photo thermal so you're going to heat something up in the visible and middle wavelengths you can photovoltaics as long as the electron has more energy than the band Gap and that's what Einstein taught us and then you have the higher wavelengths doing photochemistry and the most important of course would be photosynthesis which uses a very narrow band of red and a n very narrow band of blue and you drive all of the photosynthesis that that actually provides all the oxygen on Earth and all of the base nutrition so even if you ate an animal that only eats meat eventually you're going to add that animal down the food chain that ate a plant so it's the plant kingdom that is is our lifeblood here on on planet Earth so that sets the scene that solar energy is a really Dynamic if you were to look at the sun you would see all different points of light all different colors all going everywhere and so this was the basis of our modern understanding of of solar energy well that's totally fascinating you know and and you know that was what in the 1700s that's not that long ago I don't think yeah we've come a long ways in and in a couple of centuries and certainly after Einstein here as you say a century later and we do things they would have never imagined so solar energy is dynamic and it it provides well can provide everything in so uh the ancient Greeks uh captured solar energy how about telling us a little bit about what they did that was back in the B BC before Christ yeah this goes back now now how do humans use solar energy well let's go back or forward from when we were talking about to 25 centuries ago so fifth or sixth Century BC now Greeks had a problem they didn't have any fuel this is the Bronze Age and everyone's burning wood so where do you get wood in the 4th Century BC it was a death sentence if you cut down an olive tree to make charcoal or to burn it it was so vital to the economy so the idea of an energy crisis dogs every civilization through time well so they didn't have any wood so uh Socrates for example he used to say that the ideal house would be cool in the summer and warm in the winter and so what a concept yeah it's wonderful philosophy of life right so in architecture what the Greeks figured out is if you they did the first of the east west north south streets so that everyone had access to solar energy actually access to solar energy was a human right long before the idea of voting for anything so it's kind of an amazing the kind of humanity that they recognize that everyone has to have some heat and some light and so with architecture what the what the uh Greeks did and they were really freaked out about this this uh deforestation I remember Plato uh wrote poems of lament of his dear Attica that it was deforested in all the soft and Rich Parts have fallen away and and that only the bees can survive you know because everything was cut down so this was a big issue so they thought about it and realized okay let's start innovating something they took any window or door and above it they would create at Eve so during the high Sun it would shade but when the sun was low in the winter it was allowed access into the poro or into the into the windows and buildings and so on that picture you can kind of see where they had all of these things that they would recommend that you would now here you have kind of a portico in the center where you had a sistern so the southern part is kind of the lower right hand side and you could see the slope would allow the sunlight at low angles to reach the northern part of the house and go in through the Portico and into the into the uh North facing rooms and it would heat up the floor and they would have that radiant heat so you can imagine people padding around on the warm Stones you know in Winter fantastic and and Socrates and many others had all kinds of advice if you're going to build a second story you build it on the North side so you because if you build it on the South Side you'd shade the rooms in the north you didn't want to do that so all of these techniques and here you have this house which not only had lighting and heating through the winter but you also had the roofs collecting rainwater and the sstn in the center so what a remarkable sustainable way to have a house uh 25 centuries ago yeah they didn't have computers in those days to figure it all out like we did I guess they all they had like a scroll of Papyrus and they draw it out and figure it out and think about it oh very much and then execute it and experiment it's really fascinating to hear you talk about this amazing so solar energy wasn't just esoteric to the ancient Greeks it was life to the ancient Greeks so now let's move forward in history and let's maybe go to the ancient Romans now the greenhouse fact was long known by the Romans they had the hypoc cost where they would burn wood and had Hollow walls and Floors to heat up their baths but they noticed that they had usually three baths a very hot one a medium one and a cool one and then the medium one they simply would make some windows to the top put some glass blazing over it and not only did you get light in the bath but it would actually help trap heat now Caesar was famous for loving uh um uh the particular fruit I'm trying to remember cucumbers he love cucumbers so he had his uh his gardeners create little green houses so that they could move it around during the winter time and grow cucumbers for the emperor so uh you know the greenhouse effect was very long understood and so by the Ancients they they made tremendous use of of solar energy technology in the most practical way they could and and that's kind of fascinating because they had a big fuel problem would you know by the 3 Century BC a third of Italy was denuded of trees everyone was burning wood because how are you going to cook how are you going to get some heat and most importantly how are you going to smelt iron now the Bronze Age that was copper and tin and you're still making high temperature but when we get to iron they had to make 3,000 degrees lots of wood so they the Romans had a fleet that navari Lombardi something of that nature in in Latin ship fleets and they would send around soldiers and stop somewhere deploy some Soldiers the rest of them we cut down the trees Hue the trees uh big dig pits and throw the trees in and light them on fire and then cover it with dirt in a couple of weeks it would leech out all the impurities and you're left with charcoal and they would import that back so the idea of wood and fuel was a massive problem for the ancient Romans they actually imported wood from the caucuses which was a thousand miles away from Rome so this was the energy crises always dogs everybody okay so so moving moving forward to the 1830s when people actually started to cook with solar why don't you talk a little bit about that sure now we're kind of jumping I'm passing over like 2,000 years so what was the big thing in that brief period And I don't have a drawing for you was burning mirors now back in the ancient Greeks one of the things they did in Greece is they take a little bowl and pound some some silver really thin or gold and they would make a reflector and the Vestal virgins would start the Holy Fire from the golden rays of the Sun and so there was no pollution of men making fire and even in mesoamerica we see that they did the same thing and all the villagers would run up to the temple many miles away and they would light the fire from this initial fire bring all the the Flames all the way back to the Villages and then everyone would start their fire and so it was this Holy Connection to the lifegiving energy of the sun you know in meso America the gold was actually Tears of the Sun just wonderful romantic Notions okay so I'm going to fast forward burning mirrors were the thing and they made them larger and larger uh Francis Bacon in the 13th century proposed burning mirrors for the Crusaders in the Crusades he was thrown in jail for probably a variety of things he was quite outspoken but so the idea of burning mirrors was a really big thing okay so now we've jumped forward to the 1830s late 1830s and here we have the father of concentrating solar energy his name is Augustine maso maso was a French brilliant mathematician later a professor but when he was a young man he went to the French Academy of Sciences and said hey give me a grant because I have some designs for solar cooking and other apparatus that would be great for the French Foreign Legion now the French foreign Legions were in mostly in North Africa so you have Morocco and Libya there's no trees there's no wood so if you have 200 soldiers and they're doing whatever soldiers do and they come back to the commissary what are you going to feed them some cold GRL or something so the Academy of scientist said oh magn you know see play year do it and so he traveled there and the soldiers loved him because if if you hold up that slide what he did in the beginning is he designed these little tripods and he had the little reflectors that would fold out like an upside down umbrella and they pounded silver very thin in these little slacks and then in the middle he put a caraffe or kind of a hot pot and you'd put in your potatoes your carrots your onions put in a little wine a little meat if you have fish put fish and rabbits rabbits okay so he put a little beef if you're lucky and salt and pepper close it up and so for four or five hours in the hot sun in Libya someone would come around and kind of adjust it and move it manually to follow the Sun and then at the end of the day everyone had this fantastic beef stew that was it's like a solar crockpot and it was just delicious and you know the two cultures that to me the French and and the Japanese take their food very seriously so for the French it was quite extraordinary and so maso was really on a path here and he was extraordinary now on that lower part of the of that SL of that drawing you'll see where he did something revolutionary he combined two things that have never been combined before he took the light trapping glass of a greenhouse and combined it with a burning mirror so what he did is he took this kind of glass fixure and put an insert of metal inside and then put you put in your potatoes carrots and everything else and then you you cover the top and then put it in the sun and the sunlight would warm up one half of it but the to get the backside or the North side he put this Burning mirror reflector a couple feet back and it would shine on the back and after again four or five hours you would have the most delectable stew and you imagine you know you think of army rations being pretty tough imagine in the middle 1800s what they were but the French were were enjoying these wonderful these wonderful homecooked meals no they loved maso and then on that bottom one maso did something really extraordinary is he took off the top put a bunch of wine in it and then he had a bulb that he would put on the top with a little flute coming off and that was a condenser and so when you heat the wine with the Sun that the alcohol would evaporate at a lower temperature than the water go up hit the top bulb but then kind of seep through that little flute and give up heat and condense into liquid and would drip into the most marvelous Brandy so here he's stilling wine to Brandy you gota love the French no very practical but everyone was thrilled with this guy and he also built water distillers and that was a big thing for all around the world like in the in Indonesia or in in uh Indochina where they had different colonies is you couldn't drink the water there was too many U diseases you had to boil it that took lots of fuel so it was a great Innovation he started building distillers this guy was amazing and then the next slide uh if you go to that he did another thing is he created a water pump that had no moving Parts no fuel cost and what he did if you could see it's kind of hard to see but on the right inside they would put water in this vessel which had a glass top and kind of a metal bell jar inside they'd fill it halfway up with water and then have a feed tube they had a valve on the right side you turn off so once you you prime it and then put the tube into the water you wanted to draw you just let it sit it wouldn't drain out because it's kind of a hydrostatically would hold the water there but what happens is the sunlight goes through the glass heats up the Bell jar the Bell jar would heat up the internal air and the air would expand and push on that column and instead of you know nature takes the path of least resistance so it couldn't push the water back down the well but it could when you open the valve push it up that little thing to the left that's a little tube and it would lift the water you know a meter high or something couple feet up and and everyone was astounded now wasn't a very powerful water pump but here you have M show Designing and building quite an engineer himself as well as a mathematics Prodigy and he became a professor at tours in in mathematics but his dream was to power steam engines yeah something about that oh yeah now France had an energy crisis you know like we've heard before and they were trying to compete with England in the first Industrial Revolution well England had lots of coal and it was near the surface and they had railroads that were coming online and they only they had to go kind of a short distance France was as a big disadvantage now they had coal but it was Way South in the Pyrenees and so they didn't really have the railroads to bring it so Melle goes back to the Academy of Sciences and said I'd like a grant to develop larger and larger steam engines and they said oh s BL you wonderful go for it so he started building these large steam engines and if you go to the next slide I I say in the 1870s but there was a lot of trouble in this 1870s uh Napoleon III declares war on Prussia Prussia promptly goes in and sacks half of France so they had a problem there but they got to his lab and the the prussians took everything 30 years of all his prototype all his work his Library all his papers he was wiped out and I think it kind of gave him almost a mental uh breakdown former show but he had an assistant called piif Ray and pith Ray said I want to continue your work and he said please please continue this so what you're seeing is kind of my sketch of a wood block I saw from 1879 1880 and there was the Paris Exposition and so here's PA building this big steam engine that would shine aonic reflector like he developed before onto the central boiler and he ran a steam engine with all the parisians walking by with top hats and parasols and he ran a steam engine that ran a printing press and and would print out bills that say hey you're just looking at a solar produced printing you know this is 1880 so pay was taking on what Mas show had developed and mash show this was around the world people were astounded by this how could you run a steam engine with solar energy and how could you do it in Paris not a really sunny place right right so the big thing that everyone was really trying to do was water pump because this is a time when they didn't have the modern oil age didn't electricity was just not quite yet until the 1890s so the idea of farmers everywhere around the world trying to pump water they had to bring they had to run a steam engine with coal or wood but that was problematic if you're a remote Farm how you going to get all the speed fuel so maso had this dream he wanted to set the world free an industrial revolution of solar energy so an extraordinary man in what he did okay okay so now got a minut we've got a minute and a half oh oh so soon I'm so sorry okay next slide so this is uh inspired what maso did inspired the work by anaus and anaus had an austri Farm in Pasadena California an ostrich farm and what he did is he he breeded ostriches for the feathers and he'd sell the feathers back east in New York for the women's hats made a fortune anyway he was very enterprising so he started selling tickets and I remember one of his ads I remember reading it said come on the weekend and visit Pasadena to see the ostriches and for no extra charge see the solar motor and so what maso did based on maso what anaas did is he built a really big mascho conical concentrator as a water pump now anas had 300 acres of an orchard of citrus and he was lucky because his water table was very shallow it's only like 16 feet but his engine pumped get this 1,400 gallons a minute I had to look it up to be sure yeah a minute and everyone in Southern California and in Arizona they're thinking oh this is going to be something incredible and this is in the 1890s but we'll go fast so we'll jump to the next slide now he had some problems a windstorm destroyed it unfortunately and so now I'm going to go back to the to the Civil War and talk about John Ericson now John Ericson was the most famous nautical engineer in the world everyone knew him because he invented the monitor the first ironclad of the Civil War and he has I think 114 patents based B on ships he invented the propeller so he said after the war I'm going to devote my life to solar engines so that we can we can grow food everywhere in the world and poverty could be eliminated he he had some I didn't we don't have time but I and I didn't write them down but he had some beautiful quotes about how much he wanted to save the world okay so let's go to the next slide so Ericson set up he set up this parabolic trough concentrator okay he had some trouble as well and then he was inspired or inspired a guy named Frank Schuman now Frank Schuman was amazing because he went to Egypt and said I'm going to build a big one these are 200 feet long these parabolic troughs which would concentrate the sunlight down in the center line and he put some tubes and he was building a big water pumping system well in 1911 his tubes were all made of zinc and they melted I mean I read some of the newspaper articles they said like wilted drags and and so he goes ah and he I'm too good I'm too hot so he replaced them all with cast iron and by 1913 he was pumping in the desert in Egypt for a cotton Plantation 6,000 gallons a minute W it was astounding the whole world was just oh my God we're GNA see this tremendous solar Revolution and of course unfortunately World War I happened and he was backed by Germans all in Deutsch marks so when the war happened all his money was worthless and that eventually went into disrepair but he had this wonderful photograph of women with their parasols walking around looking at this incredible solar machine that's going to change the nature of the world and pump water for all the farmers everywhere so okay are we running out of time I don't we we're out of time oh I'm sorry okay we'll have to stop there but so the the quick takeaway would be that solar technology has evolved and humans have strived to make use of it and boy can we we can do maso pointed out and later Erikson and anaus and Schuman that you can do all of these things very practically and this is 120 years ago so you know what these guys did yeah okay we're gonna have to leave it there Toby I'd love to spend another half hour with you but we only had the 30 minutes you've been watching Hawaii the state of clean energy on think Tech Hawaii and today we've been talking story with with Toby who has a fascinating history of solar energy and I could listen to it again maybe we'll have you back for a second half and um and how smart these people were all the way back to the ancient Greeks all the way up to like the late 1800s it's amazing what we have so thank you so much Toby for educating us on this fascinating uh history thank you and thanks to our

keep your hands out of your pockets you're coming out here to see friends okay watch as things escalate quickly put your hands behind your back why T cuz you're under arrest the teen doesn't know it

each time I see something like this after doing this for so long I am still outraged terrified IED and revolted I feel for this kid her organization works with law enforcement and kids by helping to create policies and training programs to avoid situations like this this is what I call use of force for officer expedience no that is not why you use force with anybody you don't do it so that you can punish or cause and pain you don't do it to subjugate them and teach them their place you don't do it because you don't feel like running there are two settings for officer Seth Brown's taser one setting shoots darts like this connected to wires penetrating skin to immobilize a person the other setting is called Drive stun mode the device is directly pressed against the person like a cattle prod you can see brown pressing his into the teen's clothing he say it felt like he was getting electrocuted and to do the drive stun mode even though it was through the young man's clothes is a especially bothersome because that is done to cause pain pain compliance and the use of pain to get young people to comply is just wrong especially for a broken window thorough Nationwide examination

lethal and sometimes long-term terrible consequences of tasers you're putting a whole lot of kids at risk and you're not giving officers what they need which is policies training and guidance about

{"doc_id": "0pdGXldj", "video_title": "What's next in the school choice debate? | FOX 7 Austin", "video_description": "In part two of this edition of Texas: The Issue Is, the FOX Texas Trio unpacks their recent interview with State Rep. Gina Hinojosa ...", "video_transcript": "the Texas Trio is back to discuss the education funding school choice reboot under the capital Dome Greg I think that there's a lot of logic to the realign the debate argument why not make Texas teachers the highest paid in the nation take the lead in per pupil funding and then offer an exit option what do you think about that well Rudy is the proud son of a career Public School educator that sounds great to me but here's the hitch and you hit on it if you raise the pay of the average Texas teacher from 60 Grand to say 80 grand will it generate anywhere close to a 20% better instructional performance in the classroom and will it really stop teachers who can make say 90 grand in the private sector from leaving the teaching profession and will it diminish in any way the constant drum beat for even better compensation in the Noto distant future I think those are all legitimate questions here's the latest numbers from the National Education Association Texas currently ranks 28th out of the 50 states in average teacher pay and 38th in per student spending my point with what we hear is likely on the table those rankings will change significantly for the better if the two opposing sides in the legislature somehow horse trade on school choice yeah but you got to get that horse back in front of the cart I think that's my whole argument you know the new hb1 filed for session special session 4 seems to be a uh throw everything including the kitchen sink approach to this debate it spreads money a lot of money all around but in a Tuesday news conference HOSA called it a 30 page voucher bill that is embedded in 150 pages of bribes mostly to appease special interest groups Stephen their my way or the highway approach you know it certainly uh could up in my proverbial horse and cart line that I mentioned earlier but I think they're missing a big opportunity to negotiate big education Investments what do you think yeah politics is politics and you know the devil is in the details as some elected officials will tell you and I've talked to some Republicans both on the record and off the Record who didn't want to be named that aren't Rural and have said that they also are not really very Pro voucher now I talked to Justin Holland who's on the hot seat for impeachment reasons he's a republ repan from a conservative area and he told me that he's willing to negotiate but he says that the amount of money needs to dramatically increase for public education for teacher pay he says that there needs to be a scaled down approach when it comes to some type of voucher program and so I think governor abbit and the other leaders who are very Pro vouchers might need to just say let's try to get a piece of it and try to go back to the table later instead of keep trying to get all of it all at once and continue to fail here's the fly and the ointment recent polls do show that the idea of school choice has support across the state it's not the number one education issue but it has support all the legislation filed in the previous sessions were really new line items in the budget essentially limited Grant programs some of the plans even appear to offer more money than uh per student than what public schools get in the basic allotment so the pitch the house uh the pitch from the House and Senate choice quarters still seems way off and certainly not financially conservative with that said Greg have you heard any explanation as to why the Rhino slam hasn't stuck on this one interesting choice of words there Rudy my guess is this high-profile slam dunk victories have been few and far between for Texas Democrats and Austin this is one issue where team blue can land a pound painful and very public counterpunch to Abbott and Patrick but it's totally dependent on their Unholy alliance with rural House Republicans who so far have listened to their ISD superintendent that said everyone has their price and if the GOP holdouts get the kind of deal their folks back home can live with it will be over as quick as Dade feling can Wrangle up a quorum now if the standoff holds and choice dies Republicans can point at Democrats and say well go ask them why teachers in schools aren't getting billions of additional dollars as for the rural members who stood with the dims well they better pack a lunch and expect to be primaried and if they manage to make it back to the legislature both Patrick and Abbot will remember this vote and respond accordingly I you got me at Unholy Alliance more than 20 states have some type of school choice there's a big Universal plan in Arizona uh to the selected urban center approach in Tennessee some reports show recent Choice wins in other states have come not because of the argument Choice can provide an escape from failing schools but an escape from the claims of indoctrination by liberal teachers and School Board Stephen I think that's how rural lawmakers get flipped in special four hey I mean it remains to be seen everything's on the table this is politics people can have their arms Twisted but I don't think it's going to happen all right that's a wrap for this issue for now you can see this interview or any of our other past interviews by going to our YouTube pages and visit our social media sites to continue the conversation we will keep monitoring this debate on education in Austin but until then we'll see you next time and don't forget to let us know what you think the issue is", "aigc_title": "The Future of School Choice and

It really helped me come out of my shell a little bit.\"", "video_transcript": "[Music] we've got a special treat on this Veterans Day weekend as CBS Sports Texas photojournalist Bill Ellis introduces us to a US Army veteran who has been able to take up the game of golf thanks to PGA hope helping our Patriots everywhere I'm Randy Shaq served in Iraq from 06 to the end of 07 it was something I grown up with and always wanted to be be a part of all the way back to my grandpa he in Korea stepdad in Vietnam the first ID was on Thanksgiving and we're driving down the road and headed back down this road and you know you just see somebody up there on the building and then like turn and look and by the time you could react you know just explosion went off right in front of you blew BW out windows and everything rocked me really good and I was just thankful to be alive that day it left me halfway paralyzed on my our paralyzed below the waist little use on my left but really no use on my right everything from then on changed just how to do basically how to live changed and then uh just couldn't really deal with going out just didn't really want to leave the house and then kind of fill into a dark place and really fill into the bottle pretty hard for almost for about 10 years PJ hope stands for helping our Patriots everywhere and I discovered it through an email from the wreck therapist at the Dallas VA spinal cord injury unit cuz when we I got into to the unit you know they ask questions like what you did before you know where' you find joy and I had mentioned golf I had played before the military uh when I grew up in Phoenix Arizona you know there's golf courses all around the area so you know always traveled with golf clubs and hit the driving range mostly but it was something I enjoyed doing and so when I seen the email my wife knew you know you like golf you watch golf on TV you should try this I was hesitant at first you know I saw the email and I was like go PJ golf how am I going to golf in a chair I don't really want to do that my my wife was really admin about it golf just really has been an escape out of a dark hole that I've been in and it helped me get out and be around people again and being out in environment that normally I wouldn't find myself in you know I'm in this chair and then I transfer into another cart that goes on the golf course everywhere and you you always get looks and feelings but now it's more inquisitive of oh what's this contraption you're in and then it just explain to them and then you know they find out that it helps disabled people play golf and be competitive abl body and that's what golf is just brings everything everyone together no matter what and it really helped me come out of my shell a little bit PJ to get behind it it was just amazing for them to start this Flagship program this charitable donations they they volunteer their time to come here to learn to get certifi and to go out and start their own class for the veterans for free for free for veterans to come out and learn from a PJ certified Pro is it's just unbelievable brings more Focus to to the game that you want to play and then just kind of blocks out everything from that's going on in life at the time so it really helps become a the therapeutic tool and brings that competitiveness out you hit that ball and you get that great feeling you're like you know I could I could repeat this and do it over and then you know that's that's that feeling you know I could do this to be with other veterans is amazing hear their stories that they've been through and it's almost like a live history you're getting told in front of you how they from their View and what they went through we all come together on the golf course and just become brothers and sisters again greatest joy I probably received was the smiles and laughters that I hear from the people from the veterans coming around and seeing them at first when you get to a class you know everyone's kind of into their own area to themselves but then slowly you see them all come together and then it's just a Brotherhood and Sisterhood the camaraderie is right there there and picks up and you just see it go down the line together and then by the end they're all friends smiling and laughing with each other I find great passion and joy it really helps me really helps me to help other people CU I've been in that spot so I mean that's the joy I see is when they come out of their their Darkness to see them slowly come out and be able to climb out of that I I app them and you know puts a great great joy and smile on me this program and golf hope program and golf game it it really has saved my life change my life to become more Avid golfer great word from Bill Ellis

streak I think good Lu good morning to you thanks for being with us this November 12 I'm Taylor Stewart let's get right to your forecast neurologist white ever with what our Tailgators are working with yeah you just got to play Heads Up Football out there today right he can't sleep on the Browns but at the same time weatherwise we continue to look very good for the tailgate here now crisp conditions no doubt low 40s this morning on a North Breeze even with some sunshine today temperatures slow to climb out of the 40s eventually into the low 50s this afternoon but it takes several more hours to get there right now you can see Baltimore just at 46 so we've still got some work to do to get above 50\u00b0 today overall just a few fair weather clouds I think we'll see more of those clouds clearing out later today more sunshine this afternoon so A Brighter Day in a day where we should get above 50 by a couple of degrees the trend for the week ahead is certainly Sunny we'll talk about what kind of temperatures we might see coming up this morning in a city in crisis the FBI continues to remain tight lipped about the current investigation involving Safe Streets but as Fox 35's Mackenzie Frost explains from the accountability desk the latest probe proves the need for more transparency surrounding the program as the federal investigation continues involving at least three Safe Streets workers from the Beller Edison location I want to explain how this investigation relates to the questions that we've been asking for more than two years mayor Brandon Scott monzi leaders and the two nonprofits Catholic Charities and LifeBridge those are the two running the 10 different Safe Streets locations they've all refused to tell us who the Safe Streets employees are however we've been able to identify a few of the employees but that's only because of Court records and tips from you at home not because these leaders have been transparent this is Ronald Alexander now this photo came from a federal case File so the quality isn't the best but you can see him wearing a Safe Streets t-shirt and he's carrying what federal prosecutors say was a bag of drugs now according to plea agreements and these court documents that we obtained ronal Alexander not only pleaded guilty to drug distribution charges in 2021 but he also tried to use his position as a violence interruptor within the safe streets program to get out of a traffic stop with Baltimore Police and this is Ricky Evans in his plea agreement from 2018 he told Federal prosecutors that he was using the Safe Streets location he was working at as a meeting place for the black gorilla family or the bgf gang also detailed in those documents he told prosecutors he used the same Safe Streets location as a place to stash his guns and drugs and then we have Vernon Harper we don't have a photo of him but he again pleaded guilty to federal drug distribution charges in October of 2022 and again while working for Safe Streets now in this Federal affidavit that we obtained from 2010 Harper's name comes up and it's because of his Possible Be EGF affiliations now we'll take a closer look in what's in this entire document in a few days now the FBI won't say much about the scope of their investigation involving some saf streets workers but sources close to the probe tell us it's involving possible bgf affiliation now we did get a lengthy statement from LifeBridge the nonprofit running this safe Street site in particular here's what they said part of the statement from LifeBridge he there is no reason to initiate any other investigations this warrant was isolated to a single employee and the btis site was his place of work that was the focus of a search warrant but we know that isn't true because the FBI executed 15 different search warrants including David Caldwell he's one of the Safe Streets workers that's now facing state level charges because of an FBI raid and two other Safe Streets workers also had Federal agents show up at their house and that's exactly why we've been asking questions of the mayor monzi and the nonprofits running the Safe Streets locations questions like will you release the names of the Safe Streets workers when will you launch an investigation into all the safe Street sites we'll continue to demand answers from city leaders to find out more information about how they're spending your tax dollars and we're still digging for details about the latest FBI investigation into these safe streets workers and what could come next at the accountability desk Mackenzie Frost Fox 45 News in our 8:00 hour we spoke with joanni Patterson the chairman for the people for elected accountability and Civic engagement about whether or not Baltimore City residents can trust that Safe Streets workers are on the right side of the law the citizens of Baltimore want to be safe and they want to have opportunities uh particularly for people that were you know formerly incarcerated um you know to help and and be you know a light within their Community um but there is a a level of transparency that is required right and um you know but from all the actions that we've seen you know activities you know from from St Safe Streets locations um things happening to Safe Streets workers and now this FBI you know investigation you know it it does you know cause some concern and people should demand transparency Fox 45 News has continuously pushed for Safe Streets and for answers about those program we've got a full list of our stories on our website foxbaltimore.com they know what they're doing they know that they know that if they commit a crime they're going to more than likely go home questions surrounding how the Department of Juvenile Services decides which kids get released after committing violent crimes in a chill settling in across the midatlantic I'm meteorologist Wyatt everheart we'll take a look at your Ravens game day forecast and well beyond coming up right here on Fox 45 Morning News this morning in a city in crisis the Department of Juvenile Services is explaining how they decide what offenders should be released after committing a violent crime the third decision that we could make is to release a young person um to the care and custody of the garden and guardian and that is if it is a Lois um young person now many are telling Fox 45 news they feel that data that DJs is using is out dated leading to repeat violent offenders back on the streets in Baltimore Fox 45's Vincent Hill has the latest inside City Hall this week so let we go presentation a presentation by DJs deputy secretary Lisa Gary about how the department determines whether to detain or release a juvenile and we complete what is called a detention risk assessment instrument that is an instrument that we've been using um for uh the last 12 years a decision essentially made by the push of a button once we apply the detention risk assessment instrument we get a sense of a use low moderate or high risk of failing to appear for court and or um picking up a new offense but what's being considered a low risk I am deeply concerned concerning all the way from City Hall we're seeing it in our neighborhoods we're seeing it in all of our communities around carjackings to the streets of Baltimore City to get driven home they drove them home after this woman viciously beaten by a 12 and 14-year-old arrested and released 2 hours later I should be feel safe enough to walk home even the 14-year-old's mother I don't know just I don't know what to do with him calling out DJ s's decision making I think that um some issues need to be addressed as far as dealing with the juvenile Services system because I've been going back and forth trying to get the get the help that I need for her and she's not the only parent the second time that he got trouble for stealing a car and nothing happened you know what I mean I wanted to leave him there so he can learn his lesson saying the Department's risk assessment tool may need some calibrating it was um validated in I believe 2015 and updated twice since that time an outdated way of thinking mini field has been figured out by those it's meant to oversee they know what they're doing they know that they know that if they commit a crime they're going to more than likely go home a juen I get locked up right now he comes straight home back to wherever he was at now earlier this week we told you about a 12-year-old was arrested for armed robbery then released just hours later we'll get this two days later he was arrested again for the same offense unfortunately these aren't the only problems the Department of Juvenile Services is facing the agency continues to face scrutiny about how well they manage young offenders earlier this year Maryland's attorney general found problems with education Services unsanitary conditions boredom and unsafe Staffing levels there's also questions about the effectiveness of their GPS monitoring system so this past summer a teen under their supervision was linked to the Brooklyn day mass shooting in August Fox 35 found over aund youth were under GPS monitoring but there were only 14 members of the DJs staff assigned to supervise them they're not complying with the terms that have been imposed and they will continue to think that their actions are just not all that serious Fox 45 has relentlessly covered issues within the State's Department of Juvenile services and you can read all of our stories right now at our website foxbaltimore.com we're looking ahead to a big day for Birdland the division matchup happening right in our backyard and why the Ravens defense is not worried about the Browns quarterback Deshawn Watson it is Veterans Day weekend and the national Medal of Honor Museum is partnering with the NFL to pay tribute to our military members during the Giants Cowboy salute to service game today at 4:25 16 Medal of Honor recipients will be taking the field for a special halftime tribute Jim mclan is a Medal of Honor recipient he's joining us now Jim thank you so much for your service well thank you I really appreciate you having me on the show today oh and what a weekend for it here too I mean honoring our veterans all weekend long tell us tell us about your story and how you were given the midle of Honor because it was something that you did in Vietnam a lot of things that you did in Vietnam yeah well it was one battle it was 48 hours long that was zeroed in on of course I went into the Kill Zone 10 times was wounded three times during the 48 Hours uh saved 10 Americans and one Vietnamese interpreter but it took a whole lot of people to do that machine Gunners people with M16s uh the Air Force coming in of course the marines coming in with their cobras and actually the um Navy was shooting from about six miles out on onto the enemy so it was 89 of us and and there were 2700 enemy soldiers 89 you get this medal and you say it's it's not just you it's 89 that get this metal that's right that's right it's uh I wear it for them I wear it for those that that um fought in all of the wars and especially those that gave their life for this country just incredible well and this is why the NFL wants to honor you so what will we see during the halftime special I really don't know I I don't know if it be done on the field or what and they'll recognize each and every one of us one at a time but um we represent uh somewhere in the area of 44 million who have fought and worn the uniform of the United States of America in all wars yeah all war you go back to Vietnam what is it like when you hear of other Wars and other things that are going on does that bring you back to those 10 times when you back went back in to savior servman oh yeah it does remind any veteran of his particular uh experience in the war and everybody has their own personal experience of course but um much of it's the same I I really feel as if if you're a warrior you're a warrior and whatever War you fought in uh you should thank those individuals and if you really want to thank a veteran this is one thing I like to pass on yeah make sure that um you live that freedom don't misuse it don't abuse it don't abuse somebody else's freedom but live your freedom because that will thank them for what they fought for Jim I was going to say there's uh 10 times you went back in to save your fellow servicemen and they make movies about that but what you just said right there kind of solidifies the whole reason why we are celebrating uh Veterans Day and all those who have fought absolutely absolutely of course the Metal of Honor uh Museum down there has received a a nice sum of money from a Ken Griffin and uh as an educator I want to mention that I'm really happy that um young and old alike are going to be um educated because of this man's generosity and um you know he kind of like the quarterback he's a quarterback he's throwing the ball to the museum and they're going to catch it they're going to run with it um and and let me mention the six core values commitment citizenship courage sacrifice integrity and patriotism those are huge characters to pass on to our younger generation Jimmy Clen we will definitely uh honor You by living our freedom thank you thank you so much enjoy Veterans Day along with the rest of us all right our Tom Rogers there this Veterans Day weekend over 150 military members and their fam has got a special holiday meal it's part of operation home front's 13th annual holiday meals for military families from Fort me Andrew's Air Force Base and the Maryland National Guard were all given holiday meal kits according to event organizers it comes at a critical time for military families they say more than 26% of active duty enlisted service members have reported some level of food insecurity it's important for our families and our military members to understand that they America's behind them you know they're out there uh In Harm's Way doing great things protecting this country our way of life and it's really important for them to understand that you know America's behind them and supports them and on a Veterans Day something like this where we can gather and kind of show our support this is what it's all about this year the organization says they hope to help more than 700,000 family members across the country all right rounding out our Veterans Day weekend meteorologist Wyatt everheart with a look at our forecast 45 sitting pretty yeah a little crisp right Taylor uh but as we finish out this Veterans Day weekend I love the sound of that Friday right through Sunday honor of the Vets you know it's going to be one of those days it's a tough to push the numbers up much because we've got a persistent northeasterly Breeze northeasterly flow that will continue to hold temps back a little bit so now we're you know hovering in the mid-40s we're out of the 30s at least across the entire metro area but that North Breeze I mean we've had a few gusts since midnight up around 18 to 20 so yeah kind of a persistent chill in the air from the north but there will be I think steadily more Sunshine so as we look at the game day forecast a cold tailgate in the 40s this morning but I think during the actual game we'll probably hover just above 50\u00b0 with a little more Sunshine coming through you see fair weather clouds drifting through the area right now all the rain has been generally south of the Virginia state line in the North Carolina that area of low pressure is going to continue to move away off the sea and off to the south and east leaving us high and dry across Maryland not just the later today but in the Monday Tuesday Wednesday very dry quiet weather pattern setting up here and that's really your headline uh you know that fresh chill holds today tonight early tomorrow we're kind of back to 60 or so even 60 plus most of the days of this week ahead we have Sunshine for days as well big Canadian high pressure cell up north of Montreal that's a clockwise flow around this bring in the Northeast Breeze today but ultimately will just kind of lead to a quieter setup in the coming days and you see the nice mild Ridge of air all the way up into Omaha Nebraska where where the turbs had the big wind yesterday out there in Nebraska mild air midsection of the country drifts easterly as we go kind of forward in time here so these numbers that are very chilled now across the Northeast being replaced by some milder numbers that are positioned to our West that milder air does work its way in as we work our way into the week ahead upper 50s tomorrow after a frosty start then we're going to go 60 plus for most of the week I think mid 60s are very possible as we go from Thursday into Friday also know that it's going to stay dry and sunny I mean for days to come keep the sunglasses handy don't forget those in the mornings this week you're going to need them during the day maybe he head out to lunch I will say this the next chance for rain really not coming in until probably late Friday into early next weekend and that's still kind of a tentative forecast that far out we'll see if that holds up but again kind of an abnormally dry stretch here for Mid November in Maryland but I think most of us will take that we like the sunshine back all righty turning now to Sports Unlimited the Ravens demolish the Browns the first time around playing one of their most complete games of the Season 28-3 win in Cleveland the big difference this time around though is going to be who will be starting as quarterback right so last time Dorian Thompson Robinson got the start with deshun Watson out on injury that's not going to be the case today Watson's good to go and the Ravens know the challenges he presents as a dual threat quarterback but the birds defense says they're locked in and they're ready to go obviously it's Des Watson they gave him all that money for a reason so um he's a great player um but at the end of the day he's coming to our stadium with our team with our defense um with our fans so U that play going to be rocking we going to have it rocking we going to do what we need to on defense to get them jumping and um just you know try to shut him down good veteran quarterback uh been in the league for a while so got a lot of respect for him the guy can uh you know let it rip and then you know he's able to use his legs as well so we'll be very prepared for it uh a lot of confidence in Mike the defensive staff to have us ready uh for the game so look for looking forward to it all right let's go ahead and take a look at the injury report here four players are questionable for today's game Marlon Humphrey and Keaton Mitchell they have hamstring injuries Jaylen armor Davis has an illness and then Morgan Moses with a shoulder injury remember you can catch all of the NFL action right here on Fox 45 right after this show watch Fox NFL Sunday kickoff and then at 1:00 the Ravens will host the Browns right in our backyard of course you want to finish out your sports build weekend with Fox 45 and the commanders they're taking on the Seattle Seahawks pickoff there will be at 4:25 all right stay with us here at Fox 45 Morning News after the break meteorologist W everheart has his exclusive 7day here at the desk [Music] there it is Bank yeah ready to rock today right Rock the Browns Rock them all out we rocked them we rocked them last time up in Cleveland so we'll see what if they come back with an Vengeance though you know yeah well the thing my thing is this we've won such big games lately you don't want to go to sleep this I call it a game that'll sneak up on you right so let's just keep it keep it intense out there right hey weatherwise we've got good football weather um you know low 50s for the course of the game today I think uh you'll notice today it's definitely going to be a little cooler than yesterday even when the sun comes out like cool North Breeze but if you are a sunshine fan you love this week I mean it's just going to stay dry and bright uh looking good and a little milder each day in fact late week and probably mid-60s so for November right I mean this is uh nothing wrong with this forecast at all nothing wrong with it at all grab the Ravens hoodie and you're good to go for Sunday for sure yeah a little windbreaker you know break that breeze you're good and then the sunglasses all week all week long don't forget them I like your I like what you're talking about Wyatt all right well enjoy your game day thanks for joining us this Sunday and of course we're back later this evening with some pretty good investigation SP up we'll send you guys off have a great [Music] day", "aigc_title": "FOX45 Morning News: Baltimore Weather Update and Investigation into Safe

Kelce, Britney Spears childhood bedroom door, more.", "video_transcript": "let's do this the topics that people are talking about we're talking about one of the country's favorite moms Mama Keli spotted on Coach thumbs up or thumbs down the home in Britney Spears childhood homes got a little bit of her graffiti on it did you pay 30 grand and news anchors want to get a little bit Buzz during the New Year's Eve celebration is that cool Mike jerck Mike grenwich bill two miks and a [Music] bill and we are back another episode of Two miks and a bill y'all have no idea what goes on just getting this show started it's probably best they don't behind the scenes or what have you talk about the issues that are on everybody's mind and ours what's the first toate it Mama Kelsey I love her yeah she's cool so Mama Kelsey was photographed she was flying to Travis's game in Germany she was photographed sitting in coach on her way there and people are are questioning whether or not she was really in coach or was she just back there visiting whatever she was photographed sitting in coach and it started a social media wave of is she just the coolest person ever because she's that down to earth has two multi-millionaire sons and is chilling and coach or is it kind of wrong that your two multi-millionaire Sons got you sitting in coach when you're on your way over what were the com was cool right yeah what were the comments were they negative it was pretty evenly split like most of the people who first started talking about it were like I love this lady like she's one of us she wants to be one of us she doesn't care about the attention and then there were others who were like yeah but you got kids who got a100 million why they got you in coach I got it from a pretty good source that she just was flying first class and walk back back there and to talk to fans which makes sense that makes a lot of sense but apparently spent a lot of time in there even the she was sitting there hanging out in coach well she's she's like a regular person in general right so she's probably more comfortable in coach with the people should I say in coach since she are with the since she is she was a regular person in Ohio this is what I'm saying she to have two Talent she gave birth to two football players so she probably got more love and felt more comfortable hanging out with the people yeah in coach than she did In First Class so I love it for her man for going back there and hanging out with the people I love it I think that that's cool you're comfortable your money is not an issue I'm I'm here with the people what's interesting is that you said that she was just a normal ordinary person yeah you could argue that up until like six weeks ago she was when Travis and and Taylor Swift became public yeah she was still just an orary she we started to know her at the Super Bowl yes right uh in fact Alex and I were hanging out with her um and she had the double jacket on CU her two sons were in the Super Bowl that's where she first came to fame but then the minute she was standing next to Taylor Chang the game through the roof Chang the game and her comments another reason why I love her because there's no question she's a millionaire there's no question that they the the two kids have a great relationship with her so sounds like she's taken care of like we love mom and she's still it's like yo I don't need all they asked her about the Taylor Swift thing and she said I'm really uncomfortable with attention she's only had the attention for well less than a year a year right so I mean Fame and money can change anybody I love M Kelsey love everything about that I also think that I'm the person who probably would be sitting coach so n d not be n i mean I'll come back and visit like Mama Kelsey did hey y'all what's happening y'all recognize me on your way in you know what I mean he probably yeah they passed her on the way in cuz you know she was already sitting she's first class like oh is that Mama Kelsey then she felt obligated to come talk to the people if she got on the plane last she may not have went back to coach when we flew out to the Super Bowl I happened to have a first class seat just oh just happened to have one well I have because I didn't I had a claustrophobia for record iob happen to I happen to have economy at First Class helps you with your with my claustrophobia I'm not kidding fair enough so but I took a bottle of champagne back to Alex that was very nice very nice was it the free was it a free bottle like was it a man of the people we going to leave it there sharing the love I appreciate Mama Kelsey you are not we'll take a break we'll be right [Music] back we are back celebrities always drama right so Britney Spears her book was out everybody's talking about it we're well aware of some of her childhood drama but now her childhood home okay that her father sold years ago for about $29,000 in Louisiana yes is now for sale again for like $1.2 million nice and they apparently didn't do very much to the home no so there is a door in the home that says Christina sucks Brit rules nice that Britney Spears apparently wrote on the door when she was feuding with Christina agilera unclear what time frame but they were feuding it is now up for auction with an expected price of at least $30,000 for a regular old you know it's not a regular Home Depot door it's Britney Spears old bedroom door that will sell like that right soon as it hits auction for more than 30 why I don't know no there's no answer to why right it's just because if I love somebody as much as people love Britney Spears I'm might I might buy a door what I guess you can a no it's even better it's better it's just sucks yeah right it's just her chicken scratch on the door like yeah that's even better than the aut see this as a real a real item like I was world going to pay for this non I see it as not I mean yeah it's a real item you know and if you're a Britney fan and you have a place to put this door like I could see walking in someone's home and seeing the hanging up on a wall like it's a piece of artwork that says yes I could or like a music studio or something like that like I could definitely see someone picking this up remember a few weeks ago we talked about uh Beyonce's bedet right and I would I would buy that and that didn't surprise anybody no yeah how I almost get that Mike buy Beyonce is not a surprise would you buy Beyonce's door I mean Jay-Z and them sold doors from their last house right that's right what they complain that the the new owners were selling the doors saying these was Jay-Z's French doors if I was a big enough fan I would yeah just because they wrote on if I had the resources every class every piece of paper that she ever did when she was a child in school is now worth significant amounts of money because you know what ends up happening is is you buy it and 10 15 years from now all of a sudden that $30,000 door is worth a million dollars because Britney went and did something else crazy right not even she just did that re-energized her BR and now all of a sudden whoever owns this door just came up you know that they millions of Britney Spears fans who are voracious right right so they somebody's going to buy that door now I'll tell you this what you remember the Spectrum well Spectrum in Philadelphia and they the Christian lenner shot last second shot turns around um they busted that up and I bought a big chunk of wood of the and had him autograph it and I have it on the wall my house yeah see I feel like that to me seems like more art like that has a meaning to it it was the actual Court like this just a door it was the actual door that she wrote the difference I don't know what she just wrote on a door like that's a historic place and location they played there she's written on millions of things in her life this was the beginning of her career this was like the birth of her personality her character her and her Nemesis at one point right and like this is who I have beef with like I have a question think we're different go during those time periods when they were kind of equals were you Christina or Britney like I don't even remember when they were Eagles like you just told me that like I was aware that they were 16 right like I don't even they were in The Mickey Mouse Club that was before me man I feel like I like Christina's music better Christina right I will say I like mus she can sing she's got a great voice right so you know probably like but I you know I didn't follow neither one of them they were like pop little pop kid girl you know I mean it wasn't my music L $30,000 doors $30,000 door right we're going to leave it there I used to date a woman like way back in the day who lived on my block and her name is still carved in my childhood bedroom see I'd buy that for 10 grand what's that worth 0 that worth 10 bucks we'll be back and we're back and apparently me and Mike jerck are much more romantic way more than you I think that goes without saying we got names carved into the walls you were like n i I was playing it I was like I can't even tell you who I was dating at 15 16 well I was way behind you yeah like nah dude I was in the street they still in the wall like I was I was like but I also have like this uh this uh like blackout memory of anything that happened before my wife like honestly Tru truthfully dude like I really don't have much memory of anybody I dated dealt with any of that about their Nam for your wife this topic I'm guessing we're going to just get a vote we got like one minute okay sorry what's the topic the whole New Year's Eve celebration on CNN in the past they have put in place an anti-alcohol ban because the hosts of their New Year's Eve got a little crazy a little drunk Andy Cohen normally was the Drinker big drinker yeah Don lemman was was drinking and getting crazy out there also whiteair guy and coer they all all got it in got it in that celebration so they decided to ban alcohol at their New Year's Eve celebration for the hostal who knew they're trying to get rid of that like Andy Cohen is lobbying he's like look it's New Year's Eve let us get our drink on people like seeing real authentic us with a couple in us on TV it just is promoting getting drunk right like I'm kind of on a corporate side on this one man and it's they got weird for me viral they even those words coming out of my mouth feel funny on the corporate side

we're better we won't it won't happen again I can't trust that why is it so important to Andy I wonder he thinks perform part of it right no I think it's just because it's New Year's Eve like who wants to be sober completely sober unless you just don't drink on New Year's I'm at a party on New Year's Eve and you tell them you I'll give him another chance and I think it's different though another chance you blew it you can always pull him off the air but why do I want to go through what has to happen to get you pulled off the air like I I could be on board with this I know could be on board with until something happens you get in a whole bunch of trouble and it's live you can't take it back like that was viral you know what I mean their behavior on on on New Year's Eve CNN was viral that next day right for weeks after that like it's a different time like corporations don't want to deal with that was that last New Year's no it was a few it was like three years ago now see

the same week not long after leaving an Arizona rehab program this summer.", "video_transcript": "[Music] tonight all new from the 12 news I team we're getting an inside look at a sober living home that's accused of being a hazard to the people it was meant to help thanks for staying with us I'm Mark Curtis and I'm Kad deine after months of reporting the state has suspended another rehab facility suspected of fraud only after the IT team started asking questions news journalist William pittz has this investigation it's not easy to want to get help it's embarrassing for sure there's a stigma attached to it but this year Eric Elliott finally did bad as bad as it can get just a lot a lot it's been it was a progressive problem throughout my life that's something that I finally decided to go and get help for help for his alcoholism was supposed to be here Pathfinders recovery after a detox Eric enrolled in a residential Sober Living Program but right away things felt strange a lot of guys were had just been there I was like that seems weird the house itself Eric says was a disaster mold water dripping from the ceiling and we had the sewage overflow into the tubs entire house just horrible then there were the group sessions kind of a weird collection of us sitting around in a circle talking about our days before that and YouTube videos YouTube video like this is rehab yeah really weird Eric took photos from inside the house people falling asleep on the couch a YouTube video on the TV that's comedian Russell Bran's YouTube show helpful at all not particularly a lot of what goes on there is you get transported to different AA meetings Alcoholics Anonymous meetings that are also free it sounds like the AA meetings were more impactful than the rehab those the Celebrate Recovery M uh meetings far more helpful but the staff kept buzzing them to the Pathfinder office to AA Eric kept trying to do the program so did the other guys in his house you're all together at the center every day right so you're together all day long and then you're together at meetings there were two Eric specifically remers they went through the program and graduated mhm and what happened to them they died right after they got out of there he was 24 years old Nicholas shimansky and he was a great young man he had probably been to every rehab across the whole valley for maybe five minutes heroin was pretty much the drug of his choice for a very long time Tiffany zamansky knew it would be an uphill battle Nicholas had tried to get sober so many times failed so many times went to jail twice 3 months impatient at Pathfinders and then he uh he went to sober living for two and a half months and that was it worked great she hoped Pathfinders would stick but heard similar stories like Eric's the rehab he spent 3 months at gave him a packet of information from very like from day one saying this is what we're doing and this is what you're going to learn here they didn't go through even half of that stuff after about a month my son said all they do is sit there and fall asleep tools Tiffany hoped would help her son tools she says he never got then on August 17th and I talked to him on the phone and I said you don't sound right no Mom I'm fine I'm fine I knew the second I hung up the phone that he wasn't fine I found him the next morning at 8:15 in the morning and he had been gone since the night before two days later Mickey Tran another former Pathfinder resident also died the medical examiner report showed fenel and meth killed him addiction's a very dangerous demon it's very hard for many people out there and if you're not given the correct tools to get through that it's very very hard after hearing from multiple patients and their families the IT team started asking questions days later on October 5th the Arizona Department of Health Services conducted its first inspection on record for one of Pathfinder's Sober Living homes they found broken glass exposed wiring duct tape covering electrical outlets trash too many people living there no manager living on site Pathfinders was also cited for medicating the men who lived there sober living homes aren't supposed to be giving out any medication under state law the state issued 11 citations in all when we visited this week there was trash piled outside what looked like burned Furniture we tried contacting Pathfinders and their parent company baymark Health Services in Texas they said they had no comment I can't see how they can sleep at night feeling okay with that trust me if it was had a private insurance company and they caught you doing that they would not pay the entire bill and the state will still pay not anymore as of November 3rd Pathfinders has been suspended from access accused of a long list of suspected fraud billing while patients were in a psychiatric hospital duplicate billing billing more than 30 hours of services for one patient in one day billing for people who were in jail billing for more hours than Pathfinders was even open that suspension became a termination Pathfinders is now barred from the access system for 5 years well if you're billing for 2 hours of group shouldn't that be two hours of group should that not be one 14-minute YouTube video for Eric he time wasn't a total waste he is still sober do you at least feel more equipped than you did when you went in I do I do and a lot of that is through the work that I've put in on the outside um but I'm not going to Discount that I didn't learn things while I was there to be certain I did there are good people at those places There's A Life That's so much better out there and he experienced it for 6 months of his life and he thought it was the most amazing

Well, as you guys can see, we are joined by some special guests right now and it gives me great pleasure to introduce you guys to the section champion Del Oral Girls flag football team and he really, they don't need an introduction, but I'm gonna go ahead and do it anyway. Since it's on the prompter representing the Golden Eagles, we're gonna start off over here. We have C your captains Megan Matthews and right next to her, we have Callie Bo both rocking their sex and champ hats and over on this side, we have the one and only gabby in yard and right next to her, the man with the master plan, the mastermind behind all the success. Mr Steven Birch is in the building. Thank you guys so much for coming on the show this Sunday. How are you guys feeling? We're good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks for having us. Absolutely. I mean, you guys are section champs, so you earned the right to be here. Put some respect on this team. All right now, while we're talking sex and champs, you guys are fresh off winning the section championship over a very good Wood Creek team who actually got the best of you guys earlier in the season. How sweet was it to get redemption on them and do it to hoist a section banner? I mean, I think it was pretty great because obviously in the preseason, we had our little tournament and we faced them, but we were missing a few key components and obviously in the championship game, we had everyone there and yeah, we just came out and was ready, ready to win. We wanted it more and everyone knew they were the undefeated Wood Creek. So that felt pretty good to ruin that streak. Wow. I was about to say, you know, did that give you guys extra motivation going in there, that bus ride? Oh, man. Oh man. Wow. I'm curious to know what was going on on the bus ride. Coach Burch, you care to share. We were hyped to say the least good deal. Well, coach, tell us about the journey of this team really from the very beginning, which is, this is the first year as a sanction sport of flag football. So you step into a coaching position. You have these girls making history as the first ever team of Del or then you go and win it all. But from point A to point Z which is hoisting that championship banner. Tell me about journey and what it's been for you. Well, we, we're very lucky. We have a great culture of great girls sports at Delaware High School. And so I think one thing we want to do is go out and recruit great athletes. And we had a lot of girls interested. We feel very fortunate. They chose to come out to a new sport. And again, we had 43 girls on the team this year, which becomes difficult when you only play seven at a time. But we had soccer, lacrosse, basketball, softball, we had just a bunch of great athletes and a bunch of great girls. They worked hard, all everything that we had and everything that we did. Just a result of their hard work, their heart and their grit, Kevin. It's not surprising at all to us that the rich athletic history of Del Oro and here they are in their inaugural season, putting another banner on that gym full of banners that they have at Delao High School. But ladies, I mean, not only making history as champions but making history as the first to ever do it. I mean, this is a sport that's gonna grow and grow and grow in 20 years from now. You could say we started it all. So did you guys feel that responsibility this year of getting it started, I guess? Yeah, for sure. That's one thing people tell us a lot, like no one could ever take the first win away from us, which is super cool because like if you win in a different sport. Ok. It's happened, what, 20 times before, but like we're the first and that'll never happen again. You already have this many banners from that other sport. Now, you got the first one every, it's pretty great. I love that now, you know, I, I can definitely see the charisma Uzi now from all of you guys and just the positive and the ladies behind the camera. Absolutely. We have the team behind the camera and they're definitely a fun vivacious bunch. Um But one of the things I was gonna ask you kind of talked about this earlier uh when you guys were heading to the Wood Creek game and how exciting it was before every game. Do you guys have like a pregame ritual or something? Anything that you guys do? O OK. Yeah, sure. So we start off with the team prayer which actually is led by one of the girls behind the camera right now. And I feel like that is something that's always gotten us in the mood, always gotten us together, making sure that we're really a family that we work together and we know that everybody's got each other's back and I feel like that's always been a great thing that we've started every single game off with since the beginning. Clearly, you guys were excited to come out and play flag football for, you know, other girls who may be sitting watching this and maybe on the fence about coming out and participating. Uh What would you say to anyone else, uh, to, uh, about encouraging them to give it a shot, I would say definitely do it. You don't have to know how to play football, even how to catch a ball. I didn't know how to do going this season. I still not the best at it, but it worked and it was just fun to be able to experience a new sport and learn new things with a bunch of girls. I didn't even know until this season. So I would definitely go out of your comfort zone and give it a try. Well, the words to describe Del Oro football, I'm sure section champions at the very top. But how would you guys describe what the Del Oro Golden Eagle brand of flag football was? What made your team champions? I think just all the girls, like when we go to practice, we were there to work and like it would be like early mornings and like people would show up and we would just get what we needed to be done and obviously we got it done. Yeah. And then also with Del Oro, you know, Matt talked about this earlier. Of course, it, it, it receives a lot of respect for the football program and what they do. But now that the girl flag football team had a section banner. Does that give you guys the right to kind of walk around campus and be like, yo, we got our banner as well. So here's what I wanna know is, is flag football, boys versus girls. How bad are you beating the boys by? That's what I wanna know, match on a sort of. And, uh, I guess coach Birch, my, my question to you in your inaugural year, you guys won the, the section banner. Where do you go from here next year? I, I think it's all about the process, right? I mean, we're not gonna go in next year saying, hey, we're gonna win the thing. We're gonna try to get better, right? We're gonna try to show up. We're gonna try to have fun. Our two big things is have fun and play with enthusiasm and everything after that takes care of itself. Well, congratulations to all of you guys on this incredible accomplishment. It's obviously not just great for the school, but for the community in general and you guys are an inspiration to young girls out there. So, congratulations to all of you guys.

the week, but the later half looks dry.", "video_transcript": "now storm tracker 9 weather with meteorologist Holden lroy tracking a cold front offshore already starting to see some rain across the region that's going to continue to spread Inland overnight tonight and as we wake up for tomorrow morning it's been a very impressive storm up North but it is slowly but surely making its way toward the south and east and that's eventually going to bring in some cooler temperatures for the rest of the week and also there's rain chances as we head into the late evening hours and as we wake up T all morning not a whole lot of rainfall though anywhere from a third to maybe up to a/ inch of rain across the region so not totally impressive but still very strong cold front it's going to be out of here as we kind of head into Monday afternoon and even may see a few sun breaks as we head toward Tuesday morning so all at all it's mainly tonight through tomorrow morning we are tracking a storm system as we kind of head toward the Tuesday Wednesday time frame but that area of low pressure is kind of breaking away from the general flow and headed down across areas of California bringing them some rain and snow while we tend to replace that that with high pressure so we're not expecting a wash out for the Tuesday Wednesday time frame but we are expecting some of those showers to kind of Drift from the south out of California as we head toward Wednesday morning but eventually the second half of the week we get high pressure building across the Northwest we're actually tracking mainly sunny conditions for both Thursday Friday that is also coupled with some cold mornings we still are expecting a frosty start so it's about time to grab the ice scraper once again as we kind of head toward the second half of the week here's the cold front passing over the region right now you can see steady rain continuing overnight tonight we are tracking some snow up across the passes but I wouldn't expect anything more than possibly a half in as we wake up tomorrow morning dusting at best for both sanum and willamate pass but as we head toward the afternoon tomorrow you can see cloudy but dry conditions those shower changes still will hold uh South across Southern Oregon if you're headed toward Jackson or clth counties for Monday afternoon but watch area of low pressure you can see it offshore it kind of drifts into California and we get a lot of this moisture drifting North out of the North State believe it or not as we head towards Tuesday afternoon we're going to start to see some of those showers drift North maybe even a little bit of mixing early in the day but you can see just how high the snow levels are as we head towards Wednesday because we start to see some warmer air across the region again this is very light shower activity coming in from the south so we're not expecting a wash out due to the nature of this area of low pressure kind of breaking away and moving toward the South and you kind of see our pattern over the next week or so which is mostly dry we have that storm system moving into California Tuesday and into Wednesday but then we're dry for Thursday Friday and that comes with mainly sunny conditions we do have those changes on the horizon though and some models actually hint at a pretty active week as we head toward Thanksgiving week so we're going to have to watch that closely but it does look like the moisture train could make a shift back North toward the Northwest as we kind of head toward the second half of the month here's the cold front passing over the region now but you can see the area of low pressure kind of pulling off to the South down across California we do get some of those showers kind of drifting on the Northern French of that but for the most part it's going to bring rain to northern southern California as we head toward the second half of the week and that's going to force high pressure from the southwest up into the Northwest and that's why we're expecting mainly dry conditions here's a kind of better look at it high pressure over the Southwest right now this low pressure is going to move down there kind of force this back up into our region and that's going to give us some sunny skies as we head towards Thursday but it does not last for long and those rain chances will make a return as we head toward that second half of the week your 7-day forecast for the Coast 56\u00b0 Monday afternoon shower chances Tuesday and into Wednesday but again mainly a California system areas of Roseberg showers again Tuesday into Wednesday sunny conditions for Thursday cloud cover starting to increase once again by Friday snow levels High shouldn't be too much of an issue for the Cascade passes but Saturday Sunday we are going to be tracking some rain and snow across the region and for Eugene and cor valis we are expecting showers possibly Tuesday Wednesday but a cold Frosty start but sunny as we head toward Thursday and Friday", "aigc_title": "Cold Front Brings Rain and Cooler Temperatures, Followed by Dry Conditions and Sunshine Later in the Week", "aigc_article": "Catch the latest weather update

live and also at the Flyers and Pen medicine have been teaming up uh this season and we'll do so for the remainder uh for the pen medicine assist and the pen medicine assist is the Flyers and Pen medicine they donate 30 pounds of food for to local communities in Need for every Flyers assist this season so that's great news Flyers certainly gave him uh some uh donations over the weekend with a couple of good performances in both Anaheim and Los Angeles as they wrap up the first three games of the West Coast portion of this road trip they'll finish it up coming up on Wednesday against Carolina but joining us on Monday as he always does from philadelphiaflyers.com nhl.com and hockeybuzz.com it is Bill melter and Bill we got some really sad news uh yesterday on Sunday about the tragic passing of former flyer goenda cchm monik at 52 years of age what are your thoughts on Roman cchm monik you know Roman had um he had such an interesting career um and he he came over to North America 29 years old um and I remember he had he had a couple games with the Phantoms and he was actually he was actually under a kind of contract that you can't have in the NHL today but basically he was allowed to uh have a little trial period in North America and if he didn't like it or if he was sent to the Phantoms he was he could have gone back could have canceled his contract and kept a signing bonus I think it was about 40 45 days or something like that and he actually started out started out with the Phantoms because uh Brian bsh had that great rookie year and you know like checkman cchm monik had won I think five consecutive championships in in the Czech league and he'd won in he'd won the world championship for the Czech Republic he won a gold medal um so like you know what we we'll take a look at him but there there was no um you know there were no guarantees he was going to come over and make it now you know lo and behold that that year um Bush really struggled his second year um you know the Flyers turned over coaches Craig Ramsey was replaced by Bill Barber and next thing you knew uh Czech mon was the flyer starting goalie and he was an Allstar and he was um he was a VZ a runner up that year um you know and and but right from the start I mean chick monik was just so unorthodox and net um people always talk about the the you know the cranium carum the sa save with his mask my favorite say from Che monic it happened more than once he'd get turned around he'd actually be sitting in the crease in with his facing the net and somehow somehow he dive this way or that way or swing something around and you know and make a save and when you look at his career regular SE season numbers um you know not not even just the awards not even that he was a VZ and a runner up and and he won a Jennings trophy one year and but you know his career his career goes against the flyers in mind you this was during a lowc scoring year in the NHL but still I think it's about a 193 195 career goes against with the Flyers and and and on the Flyers alltime list and remember Roman was only here three seasons um 20 shutouts only Bernie pan had more CER shout outs is disgusting disgusting number yeah it is it's crazy I mean when CH monik was on um he could he could be unbeatable and I remember one time Rick to had said of him you know it's like he's guessing out there but he's he's guessing right you know um and then when he was off obviously it could get ugly sometimes too I mean but it didn't get it didn't get ugly a whole heck of a lot with him his numbers yeah for you know for early 2000s and his numbers are pretty ridiculous by the way his rookie year he was 29 years of age he was drafted when he was 29 which is another Rarity obviously but uh he was fourth in the heart voting in his rookie year yeah y you know so it was I mean Roman you know and then he was uh I mean he his first year in Philly he loved it here actually the reason why they actually got Yori dopa who was his best friend in in the Czech League over here finally because dopa remember dopa so many NHL teams tried to bring him over and nobody could get him to come over yeah um you know it was because Czech monik was loving it here that first year it it ended up you know didn't end up great by the end but I mean when I mean cmik was just um you know it was a Highwire act every game but yet the as you said the numbers were just just fantastic and and also you know I think I think to put a little more context to to the you know to the playoff failures which were as much team failures as individual remember the Flyers had that seven game series with Toronto 2002 yeah and you know and everybody oh well Czech monx is just gonna blow skyh High when the series was on the line in game seven cmik was great and it was actually had bfor who blew skyh high in that game yeah yep so you know I mean bfor is a Hockey Hall favor and chm just outd do with him and with with the series on the line um and when they had the two series that scores that goal is that the ronic goal um that that was the next year okay next year that the ronic goal was in game six and end that it was it was back toback just Classic Series yeah um I think the I know the the 2002 series was the one I think with three games went to least double overtime wow well that was that that was just that was just an insane series and it was um unfortunately by the time the the Flyers won that series they were out of gas by the time they by the time they played Ottawa you know in that second round yeah but for those back toback years they lost to Ottawa one year was in five games one year was in in six games but the three games they won in those two years Jason were all shut outs by CH M he never got more than two goals in a game either of those two Series so every game they won was was a shut out by him so that you know so I I don't think he put it all on the goalie they didn't win yeah I mean when you look at you know in his rookie year again he's 29 years of age he plays in 35 or he plays in 59 games he gets 10 shutouts one in every six games is a shut out that's that's an insane number and then over his Flyers career like you said he gets 20 total in 163 games so basically one in every 16 games and then he plays 49 games to end his NHL career in LA with the Kings and he gets another five yeah like that just tells you that's a goalie to me he was the only goalie bill that had some resemblance and it's odd that it's his countryman maybe it's not odd the Dominic hasik and the unpredictability and the way that he would make saves it was so unpredictable for shooters that it tied them in knots at times because it was so unorthodox yeah they they didn't say well he you know he didn't know what he was gonna do so what how the shooters know exactly he yeah he I mean he he knew he there was a method to the madness and also one thing with Roman too he he was 6'4 where hasha was little yeah you know so he was all arms and legs you know and um yeah you know Che chech monik really had a I said a short career but a really interesting career I mean he he won I I had five or six championships in the Czech League won a World Championship and then he had that run where he was just unbelievable you know especially in the regular seasons in the NHL um you unfortunately Roman's later years um after hockey were we're not trou yeah a a lot of personal difficulties financial problems um financial problems spilled over the legal difficulties and you know put strains on marriages and those kind of things it's uh you know Roman's later life really wasn't great uh you know I I they're still trying to determine exactly what the cause of death was but from but a hockey rank and and I'll add this too um you know one thing that because R's away from the game for a while um was was trying to go out the business world and it didn't really work out for him one thing that that did give him happiness in in recent years was he did come back to the game and he was coaching youth hockey um you know in the Czech Republic and you know he seemed to really really love doing that so you know it's um it's a very sad story um I I remember Roman being pretty friendly guy very quiet very very quiet and he struggled with his English um when he went back when he went back home after his career um he talked a little bit further about that that you know it was um it was it was a struggle for at times yeah because uh you know and I and I think sometimes too people were not as patient with him as they could have been because he struggled to communicate sometimes yeah and and you can kind of put yourself in in his shoes too right you're in a foreign country you've come over at age 29 you know so it's not like a player who's been over here since he was 18 he he was speaking only cze playing playing in the Czech league and he came over and was trying to learn English it was hard for him and I don't think you know I don't think everybody was understanding as they might have been but he still had a you know but he still had a lot of success nonetheless he did in short career um and he did have a tremendous amount of I mean the numbers speak for themselves they're they're eye popping numbers in a lot of ways um so uh rest in peace to Roman chech monik and our thoughts and prayers are with uh his family and everyone close to him uh bill you know this past week I thought it was God such an interesting week of Flyers hockey and if you follow along on social media you know that that swings like up and down like a toilet seat right um and it did this week you know because they go into San Jose and they lose to the sharks get their first win of the Year sharks were 010 and one at that point and sharks really played a good game I didn't think the Flyers were particularly good in the game they outshot them significantly but to me it didn't look like a game that the Flyers should have won by you know they just got robbed by McKenzie Blackwood in a performance I didn't see it that way I thought the Sharks just played better and the flyers I think took them for granted a little bit and they can't do that they're not in position to do that Vegas can do that and probably get away with it Flyers can't yeah but then they come back in Anaheim and LA and they played two very diligent games and two very different games what was your kind of summation of this week in flyer hockey well yeah the you know the that first game against San Jose you know I I expected San Jose to after Greer came in the locker room you don't often see too many closed doors with GM and the players I still expected the Flyers to win when you're talking about a team not not not just to they're 010 and one you know and that that's bad enough as it is but in 11 games they had a minus 43 goal differential I mean some for yeah yeah some some last place teams have that for a season they were minus 43 after 11 games yeah um back back-to-back 10 go games against their their penalty kill um was they getting scored on one out of every three penalty kills um you know when you come out and you you find yourself 90 seconds into the game already trailing to them and uh you know I mean it was just a yes the Flyers had a lot of shots on goal I mean this this said it all some sometimes the analytics can be deceptive sometimes they tell you a lot this is a game where the Flyers only had 11 11 High danger chances all game against one of the worst offensive teams in the last 30 years so they were working hard but not very smart and they they you know even though it was a two to one game I think they deserve to lose that one you know yeah so you know you come out and Anaheim had had been hot they they I think it was at six in a row they'd won they just they were just coming off the winning streak but they they're playing pretty good hockey um and the Flyers are really at a Crossroads there it's what I wrote in the the Friday four check column that they're really at a Crossroads here because they were playing games that they deserved to win and you know or played well enough to put themselves in position to win going into the third period and that wasn't the case against and and it wasn't even truly the case against San Jose who they really again should have beaten so I I was worried going into the two games this weekend especially with the proposition you're playing another back-to-back for the second time in two weeks you're playing la which a good team they're rested you're you're playing back toback again they're laying in weight again one once again once again that's you know that's a really tough proposition going into those two um and the the Flyers as you said two different kind of games but but two pretty good games and both were both were deserved wins yeah I think you know the thing I said after the San Jose game here on Flyers daily was you know these games are going to happen especially for teams that are rebuilding I went through a bunch of teams like Detroit through their rebuild and I went through you know teams like you know that Buffalo or other teams that went through the rebuild and are good now and where they were a couple years ago and seeing losses to bad teams that's these things happen in a rebuild you have some really good wins in a rebuild and you have some really losses that make you think like oh my God we're going to be at the bottom of the standings for imp perpetuity that's not the case and it really got drove this conversation this week but to me after the San Jose the whole message was that game's over with the only thing that matters and I I agree with you they were at a Crossroads not only because you lost to San Jose but because of the timing and the way things have gone of late and what was on the schedule I'm going boy this could get away from them really quick I know they want to play a lot of meaningful games this year they're getting close to them not being meaningful really fast so they were at a Crossroads so the only thing that mattered after the San Jose game was how they responded to it and if we go by the two games in Anaheim and LA they responded beautifully because I think they were two different games in the way they were played and the way they had to win them and they showed an ability to win games in different ways which I think is a big thing no um absolutely agree and uh you know I mean nobody's worried about Sam ERS anymore for example yeah that that San Jose game he he was fantastic in that game it's uh you know I mean all the credit to Leo Carlson for his hattrick um Flyers took actually a lot of bad penalties in that game if you break down the penalties in that game most of them are pretty bad and and avoidable penalties um there there's so many games where that game so many situations where that game could have gone off the rails and um you know uron really stepped up when they need him to situationally um it's a shame you know you give up that third goal you give up that second power play goal late in the game and it flattens out a lot of your numbers yeah but they you know they but they deserve to win it and that third period that's a game where you know you have uh tippet really step up big in crunch time guy they they need and what what a what an amazing goal that was to unbel that's the Conor McDavid type goal like where he passes to himself around a guy he got so much speed going through the neutral zone into the zone and then he just the finish too I mean it was beautiful and Bill like do you notice this too I talked about this in yesterday's episode when Owen Tippets Got Confidence like there's some players you know just watching them through two shifts into a game you don't you're like I don't know has he got it tonight or not Owen tippet when he's got confidence you you watch one shift you go oh my God he's got it tonight you just see it like he wears it oh oh for sure yeah like uh he he grabs the puck and he goes that that's how you know that tippet is on his game his decision making and decisiveness yeah yeah and and it's just uh it's a more aggressive brand of hockey with he's feeling it um you know and sometimes sometimes when he's not you can almost see the wheels turning a little bit he's a little too fine with his shots you know he'll miss the net sometimes by by a wide margin just because he's trying to be too fine with it um and yeah when you know when he's clicking it it's something you know it's a sight to behold and uh you know and also lately so far this season um because he was also just fantastic absolutely tremendous in that San Jose game Travis sanheim um he was I mean between the ice time he loged between one heck of a goal that he scored in in that game um you mean the Anaheim game yeah yeah I'm I'm sorry I meant I me the Anaheim game um yeah just uh just the shift after shift after shift he was out there every other shift you know with the the game on the line and uh you know he really he really look like a stud defenseman in that game did yeah so that was you know two guys who you you came into this year saying are key guys in a game where you had you pretty again you pretty much had to win um just to just to okay erase the taste of of what happened um the previous game in San Jose you had to win in Anaheim and uh guys that you really wanted to step up for you did just that so that was uh you know and you so you felt a little bit better you know it's okay it's you know as you said the the first game San Jose that it was gone how did you respond to it and they responded as well as you could hope yeah I I think with sanheim in that goal you know you look at a long season and you know I remember I think it was Barry Sanders talked about this in the NFL he said when I'm in you know week four against Green Bay whatever right at Ford Field he goes I can put my shoulder into a guy on the sideline and gain an extra yard but I got to make business decisions yeah I gotta pres I only have so many of those hits in my body if it's a playoff game I'm going for every inch but other times I'll just step out of bounds I'm making a good business decision I thought Travis sanheim going down the left side against Anaheim he could have made the business decision and just wheeled around the back of the net and tried to center it but but he looked at I mean just the facial look on him and in slow motion too was like I'm driving this thing harder than that he just looks so much more confident in the power he can play with yeah and that that's that is a testament to how so much of that was the work he put in the off season it's the physical side but it's also the mental side there was a determination yeah you know and and um yeah he had that he had that look that he was not going to be stopped yeah and very Bobby or it was yeah oh it was I mean he might not score another goal like that again all year yeah or came from the other side but yeah yes yeah didn't go flying afterwards either but uh it was it was a just just a heck of a play taking into the net like that a great finish on it um you know and maybe maybe the goalie does get to and reaches it but it was just a you know just a statement kind of a play so it was uh it was pretty cool players playing with a chip on their shoulder I think there's always two very great motivators in sport for professional athletes one is contract here yeah and the other is shoving it up everybody's giggy you know oh you thought I was this you thought I was that I'll show you yeah and another guy in that boat bill came up big against the Kings and it's Morgan Frost first you know a lot of people look at that first go that he scored where he goes behind the net and go you know double Bank as luck I don't look at it that way first of all because of the speed he came down with that was cam talbet overplayed the over overplayed the post yeah yeah he did and that opened up the Morgan sees that and he goes okay there's a ton there let me throw it there because the goalie is not going to be in the middle of the net for him if it does hit off somebody to stop and so I think that was a really Savvy play by Frost toore score that goal and then obviously the second goal right on the edge of the blue paint he makes a deflection we haven't seen a deflection goal I don't think all year since James Van Reams like last year yeah yeah and it's not the kind of goal you typically see from it was it was interesting you know and and uh and what I commented on on social media is you know it's the way it's the way hockey goes um the previous week uh you know and I I posted a bunch of Clips because everybody was saying he has no well he has no no points he has no points he was creating so many great a chances that uh kkny and Forester and a couple FR for frost himself nothing was going in but the chances were there and they were all great A's just nothing went in and then you have the you have the game in Anaheim where Frost gets an assist he didn't even really deserve um you know I mean yeah he kind of broke up a play in the neutral zone but really kind of went off his skate he wasn't even really trying to break it up and and the it was really a great individual effort uh I tip it but you know on the score she looks the same it's an assist as you know his first official point because there was the one that was taken away uh in in Buffalo and then you know puck luuck or not right so one bounced his way so it's now he's got two points in two games and you know oh he's coming on and I thought he was playing pretty well before and these were these were kind of a little bit of Puck lock for him it it just tells you that if you you know you create opportunities a few are going to start balancing and and then you get then you start to get the ones that are the you know the nicer kind of goals and nicer kind of um and there's there's nothing the thing with a playmaker you know and it's the team nature of the game uh because to me Frost is was and will always be first and foremost a playmaker I I look at I look at chance that's created more than I look at his goals I mean he had 19 goals last year to me if Frost gets 15 with a lot of of assists I'm fine with it um but the thing with the playmaker is he needs the guy to finish it too yeah um you know so uh I I really you know I kind of thought he was there I didn't didn't understand or or like him sitting that other game because I to me last week and if you you know the numbers back it up if you look at chances created the previous week from the games against Carolina and buffalo um nobody's creating much of anything against la but but but in those sets of games no now no other player in the fly has created more chances so I didn't think he deserved to sit um but you know the the goal that he scored the deflection goal well then you said no nobody's doing that I mean if you look if you really break down that play um first of all first of all keky made it nice play coming around the boards did and so could go low to High um ordinarily that would be frost taking it around the wall there that's usually like handling the puck there but you know kkny took it so he had the opportunity to kind of set up shop in front of the net and then stealer made a really nice low deflectable shot yep um because if it because if it's a a wild High kind of shot nobody's deflecting that yeah so you know that was really you know he got he got to the right spot to to finish it but really other people help set that up and again it's the team nature of the game but there's a lot of relief on his face when the the first one finally bounced in and then the second one he was like yeah that was uh you know that you could see that that felt pretty good so yeah I you know my view with him is always you know and and people are social media oh you must be ecstatic you know I was like it's it's just it's just my thing with frost is I just want him playing yeah I I believe I believe that in the player that if you put him in the lineup with skill around him and just leave him alone and let him play the points will come so you know two goal game is nice um he he needs you know he needs to produce that that still is the the the main point of his game um I don't know how many goals he's GNA score to the net because I think the you're still more GNA more often see him handling the puck and trying to set guys up so you know so it was good goal at a key time in a big game and hopefully it's a confidence booster but you know I I don't I don't think any player not just not be it Morgan Frost be it Tyson Forester be it Bobby Bran who who sat last game and I think it'll just be for the one game but it means it means a lot to players they know that if you have a couple of day nights where it's just not working for you or or whatever you're gonna be back out there next game that's that and and I you know my biggest issue that I kept beating that drum over was that I thought he earned it last year he'd earned it last year and he'd earned it in Camp and they pulled the plug very quickly after two games this year and I and I just you know I reacted to that but yeah you know but I but I think that um you know he's not uh he just have to go out there and be Wayne grety just go just go out there and contribute be be part of the solution to the team and that's really I think all anybody can ask that's all well you know he's listening to coaching because they got out a spray can and Drew it basically an elongated crease on the ice the other day and worked on it in practice and they did a small area game where guys could only score in the air that was inside the area that they elongated the crease to in other words get guys going to the net Frost gets one there uh cam mckinson had one hit off him there and go in um Tyson go there you love that like I said this on the broadcast because Brian Smith is out there and he's saw that practice and he brought it up I said I said you know what coaches love about that they love when you work on something in practice they see it in the game and then they see it get you a goal in a game and you know and you know why they love it he goes why is that and I said because it proves they were right coaches love being right yes let me ask you Bill about Shawn Walker I mean like are you serious like this guy you know when I watch La prior to him getting here Shawn Walker I was watching Drew dowy and an copar last couple of years you know and yeah I wasn't paying a lot of attention to Shawn Walker but this guy just I mean the way that the Flyers are playing in transition and when he's on the ice you know he he's created so many chances by making a defensive play and getting it going the other way even on at times this year getting up the ice himself when the puck isn't obtained by him are you just surprised what you're seeing out of Shawn Walker is this sustainable is is this the player and we just didn't know it uh you know when he when he was in LA and he was healthy um but I think the health is a big piece of this here yeah he he he you know I I didn't know that he had the kind of uh offense that he shown I thought of him being a guy good skater you know um moves the puck well defends pretty well th those things I I knew he could do uh and I you know every once in a while you think he contribute offensively he's contributing more than every once in a while he's he's making things happen really at both ends of the ice um and and you know through the neutral zone too he's made he's made a lot of really good uh breakout passes on the tape um yeah if you look you look at tippit's other goal we talked about the one in Anaheim uh blocks a shot makes an outlet pass tape to tape and all of a sudden Off to the Races y you know that's which is an element the Flyers have needed um you know I I know he just turned 29 I I think I think he came here with everybody myself included figuring okay it's a a one year even less than one year from start of season to trade deadline situation F him for a pick yeah and that that was just it right just they wanted La wanted a little bit of cap space you you flip them for a pick the at the deadline Etc and again they'll get offers they'll be tempted yeah I trade if if I'm out of it I trade him and I try and sign him again in the offseason yeah exactly exactly but I I think he's actually he's actually worked his way into where hey you know this might be this might be a player we might want to have around for a few years yeah so that's uh you know he's he's worked himself into consideration and he's earned it too he's been he's been really good and also quietly because if you remember last year Nick Steeler was pretty much exclusively third pairing he he's been playing more second pairing a little bit by necessity because of the the third pairing has been a little uneven um more than a little sometimes um so I you know I I think those guys who were you're thinking going in okay it's a six you know a six or seven with ceer figuring six because of how much he played last year and and Walker being a five Walker's really been a a really solid second pairing guy with the team this year so that's been one of the one of the most pleasant surprises yeah I mean bill it's only 15 games that we've really been able to look at them up close but to me he looks like more of a solution than I agree you know what I mean agree plus I think that guys that play the way he does 29 is not old yeah that on the blue line that plays the way he does he doesn't have a a tremendous amount of milees he got same amount of games in the NHL as Victor menty 247 games you know what I mean so played four years of college so I I think he's a guy that boy he's really kind of answered the bell and Bill this team I mean the biggest change year to year to me is nothing about Personnel it has nothing to do with Ivan proov it has nothing to do with Kevin Hayes it has nothing to do with guys that are gone and new additions to me the biggest change year-to year is the philosophical way this team is playing its game in transition and transition can happen start in your dzone or it can start in the neutral zone and this team plays insanely faster in trans it's not a little bit yeah it is I think that a good way for a defenseman to get benched would be a DTD pass at this point yeah like it is get the puck possession and get up the ice no East West yeah it's incredible it is and and uh it goes back to again the puck moving faster anybody can skate when you when you move the puck as efficiently as they have um and uh you know the whole team looks faster and and also fun to watch too I think people are enjoying that element because it's more fun to watch oh for for sure and look how aggressive they've been to their own Blue Line yep right and so you don't have guys backing in all the time and uh so they turn over pucks at the Blue Line and you know the there's when you turn over a puck in the neutral zone and you're dealing with short ice and you're already have guys moving into the puck you know that uh that that makes so many things happen on the ice and uh the Flyers went through a little stretch there where those plays were happening but they weren't getting rewarded yeah um and the last couple nights the the rewards have been there too yeah I think the big thing too bill is if you're going to go D Tod pass and try and set up your structure to attack then you're now at a disadvantage because all all you've done is allow the opposition to clog you in the neutral zone in particular and it makes Zone entries much more difficult where you become much more of a dump team which is losing possession yeah and then you have to you know rely on a good four check and winning individual 5050 battles and I just don't know that you know this team is constructed in a way that that's advantageous playing fast in transition the other team doesn't have a chance to settle in they're just trying to scramble to get back in cover and you can create opportunity and they and flyers do have some players that can score off the rush and in transition when you look at tippet you look at keky you look at faraby all of a sudden is a player in that realm as well so I think they've got those players um Bill last thing um we had our first NHL coach fired um it's Jay wilcraft from uh the Edmonton oers by the way he has the highest winning percentage of Ed any Edmonton Oiler head coach in the franchises history and that is saying something GL there yeah that's that's actually surprises me yeah um but he's only been there for one was only there for one full season came in uh as a replacement and is being replaced now and look I know that the thing in the NHL is you know why do they always fire the coaches in season well it works you know and it has worked on so many occasions and Jay W he's a victim of that um but where I look where the Edmonton Oilers are it's by no means a coaching issue to me I look at where they are and to me it's very simple it is a roster issue it's a construction of roster issue and I don't know how they resolve it because the way things are going there Conor McDavid is not going to extend there I don't know that Leon dradle is going to extend there the extra year is not going to be enough to entice those players this Edmonton situation I think this is the beginning of something very enormous in totality no question no question we talked about the flyers being little inseason Crossroads here if they win the freaking uh Lottery Bill I'm gonna have it meltdown yeah all all all those years of winning the lottery placing the you know yeah and uh you know I mean but what it also tells you too though you win the lottery and the guy comes out you know the guy is the Superstar he's pegged to be and it still is no guarantee of your team winning anything you still have to you still have to put the right pieces around them and and play a certain way I mean the Oilers have been really built to be a very good regular season team um this season struggles aside um are they a team that that's built to win in the playoffs that's that's been the question mark and you know they they're you know when when you talk about playing playoff Style hockey um the the Oilers are I mean for one thing a lot of times in the playoffs you get there and I mean the Oilers last year especially their power play was just incredible was over 30% you know it just uh it carried them a lot of games but you have to be able to win five on five too and in Edmonton if you could stay out of the box Flyers did it against them actually you stay out of the box against them all a sudden you have an Avenue to beat them because they were not a great five on five team and they're still not a very good five on five team and I think that they're going to have to get a lot better there and a lot of that is personnel and the way that they you know the way that their personnel is constructed and they play um so you you'll probably get the change of Coach bump in the beginning and uh and you know um Good Luck to to Chris noblock who was a good guy was here with the Flyers assisted for a few years y um you know he knows he knows McDavid having coached him with the are otter yeah so there there's already a relationship there I think you'll have the the new coach bump that can can run a while but but the the over the underlying issues are all still there so it'll be interesting and you know as you said it's not it's not like McDavid and dry cight are on their entry level or just coming out their entry levels they've gotten to the point of their career they want to win yeah right and they want to be in a place where they're going to contend you know to win for a long time so it it's um yeah it's getting to be kind of crunch time there for sure bill it's my contention that generational or when you pay players what they're paying McDavid and what Chicago is gonna end up paying Bard out of his ELC and what you know they're paying dry SLE or what's happening with Matthews getting paid in Toronto I I don't know that in today's NHL that you can build a team that can win a cup because like like Colorado won it and you know obviously they had McKinnon and they had marar neither of those players are getting that kind of money Tampa yeah we know how good they've been none of those players are getting that kind of money because of the tax situation down in Florida and they've all taken you know kind of deals because they they bring home more money I just don't know that you can pay a Player 13 million dollar and the percentage of cap that goes with it and build a team in today's NHL and win in a 32 Team league yeah depth is too important and I just don't know how you can do it yeah and and I mean that that that's a huge piece of it and also R in with the depth is that the teams that are like look Bo that's a damn deep roster how' they do it a lot of times you have guys who are second round picks mid- round picks yep um you know um coov in point were not first round picks for example in Tampa Bay and so sometimes it takes a while for the salary to catch up to uh to their level of play sometimes they're run their third contract by then yeah and that's how you that's how you can work around with a cap with with a lot of Superstar players but eventually you know eventually there's a finite period of time you can do that and uh when you have the you the guys who are making the maximum salaries yeah it's uh it it definitely makes it hard and you also have to figure out how much you're gonna allocate cap wise to each position on the ice Toronto's big big issue is all front all front all all front exactly and um so you know Matthews Marner NE you know uh nander you have those guys there and all you know and so much of your cap is allocated there they haven't been able to to plug holes in the blue line or in that in goal you know it's been uh there's always been kind of one fatal flaw that they haven't been able to address and that that's something in the Capo that uh the teams teams try to figure out how how to strike that balance so uh yeah I mean it's all in you know it sounds great on paper adding a John Taris which I think was kind of it was redundant yeah but they they didn't need they didn't need Taris as much as they needed to Sol other need and that's nothing against the player himself who's a great player but just it's just in how you just in how you construct the pieces in a cap environment the Prudence the ability to defy the good story and the player that wanted to come home yeah that's been a really good great player for the country and and would love love to play in Toronto the Prudence it would have taken to say no would have been the right decision but it wasn't made and Kyle dubis is now um kind of sitting in it in Pittsburgh and uh people like oh they wanted to call this guy the greatest thing since slice bread this Kyle dubis but um he's gonna sit in it now good luck because it's not a good situation there no no it's not that's a whole episode on its own and I'll tell you what since we've been going a while next week on next week's episode bill and I are going to dedicate a big chunk of time to the Flyers Bruins alumni game we are going to break down this roster and I am so happy Mike Richards is coming home yes so we'll talk about all that next week and uh we'll break it all down but in the meantime do yourself a favor read philadelphiaflyers.com nhl.com and hockey boss.com you

A new piece of equipment is gaining popularity in the field of competition. The goal is to revolutionize brain protection in sports. Fox 40 three's Andrew Calista shows us how it works. A small simple piece of equipment with a big goal protect athletes heads and their brain inside the Q collar. A wearable device similar in size to a headband designed to mitigate the effects of repetitive sub concussive head impacts by using gentle compression to the jugular veins in the neck. This pressure slightly increases blood volume in the brain which reduces the brain's movement upon impact. I'm a firm believer in, you know, it's the simplest thing you can do to protect what's most important. Doctor Wayne Olan, director of minimally invasive neurosurgery at George Washington University explains how the Q collar is intended to work. You have a structural housing, but then you have a bag inside the housing and then all the stuff that's important is inside the bag. So you have this potential space between the bag and the housing. If I can fill that potential space up with something. So what's inside the bag can't move around at impact. And that's the, that's the basis of it. The inspiration behind the Q collar, the battlefield and protecting America's defenders. This thing was born to, to protect our soldiers. It wasn't born to protect. They were left tackle. Doctor Olan is also a high school lacrosse coach. While concussions get most of the focus in the sports world related to head injuries. The Q collar intends to protect athletes from repetitive blows that often occur in sports since your brain in the majority of time doesn't occupy or doesn't have a tight fit inside your skull is going to move around. And what we're trying to do is basically take a seatbelt and hold your brain steady inside your skull. Why there is an acceleration or deceleration, whether it be front, back, side to side, whether it be vibration, anything. So the brain is held much tighter. Two colors are gaining attention as various professional athletes wear them locally. One college athletic trainer has noticed their athletes wearing the devices, college athletes are gonna try and do whatever is gonna keep them on the field the longest. If they see that there is some type of science, it, they're gonna try it out. If they like it, they'll use it if they don't like it, they won't use it. Doctor Emily Dietz, head athletic trainer at Elizabethtown College sees one possible downside that other researchers have mentioned. I think the only negative effect to it is it might provide a false sense of security. It might give these athletes, oh, I have this Q collar on, I can go bang my head into this other athlete and I'll be OK. I'll be protected designed for athletes 13 years and older, the FDA approved the Q collar in 2021 a two year study conducted by the University of Cincinnati. Children's Hospital showed 77% of the collar wearing athletes did not have significant changes to the white matter of the brain. While 73% of non collar wearing athletes had significant changes. The FDA approval summary also stated a link between the changes the studies revealed and the actual brain injuries has not been validated. The FDA also noted the probable benefits outweigh the probable risk. Another piece of equipment with further studies and statistics aimed at finding the best protection possible for athletes heads and their futures.

tree tree branch sorry my bad why I keep saying tree it's a small Branch from the tree during the time of installation some of the branch fall off and and they basically tie with a different types of ropes the Big Branch so it doesn't broke so I got that rope as well you can see the picture on my community post on YouTube in order to fill the Google form I think you had to sign in with your uh

as much as I can because I already make those uh Branch even more tiny pieces I'll try to make it even more tinier so that everyone else can get it Davey in canas in does anyone have their coats on everyone because it's too cold Davey [Music] hey Brian from good to see you here we to see you from joining iwa [Music] s things uh seat I donate mine to one of your followers no wor sell I'll send it to you as well I'll text you on [Music] Instagram I always want to do this thing I want to even do this thing last year as well but last year I didn't get any branch everyone else took it but this year I made some connection and I asked people work there that you should definitely give me a bench this year I need it and there are some nice friends of mine who helped me to get it so thank you to all those lovely Soul as well it sounds maybe something very like simple but believe me for someone it's a very special thing that's what I always say things that feels very simple to you someone else it's very special so never underestimate anyone else feelings hey Jen Claus good to see you here I'm here Fifth Avenue and uh 42nd Street DC White saying hello C Brian park looks good it was a mass last month when you visited dead I mean yeah they were pretty much making this winter village that's what that's why they remove all the Sal and [Music] everything finally tonight it does feels like a holiday season and a holiday spr as I said that once Rocka Center Christmas tree arrive in New York City everything looks so festive so so much better the holiday sprit are 100% right [Applause] now and now you might ask that how they choose this tree so it's very simple they had a like a they had had an option in their website that you can fill out a form and they had some specification that the tree have to be norrow Spruce and between 45 to 75 ft tall and some other requirement if you know or have someone this kind of tree willing to donate they can fill the form and the head G Gardener from Rocko Center his name is Eric so Eric will go to that particular individuals and they he will see all the trees and whatever looks good and match all the specification that will be chosen so this is how they basically chose all those different types of Christmas tree every year and it's a very special moment for all those uh different families over the years and uh this tree they chose 5 months earlier but the family had to keep it secret from everyone they are not like they had no permission to share that that Rocka choose their tree because then someone else might do some vandalism and stuff like that so they want to make sure it's kept secret until the very last week before they cut down the tree and this year tree was from vestel upstate New York it made a 200 miles uh Journey from vestel to New York City and I was there in the morning I woke up around like 5 5 a.m. and I was at Rocko Center since 6:30 because the tree start installation around like 700 and complete around like 1100 a.m. so I stand all the time just to film that installation and share with you guys I hope you guys like that Rock fulla Center Christmas tree installation video I can see that you guys are enjoying it [Music] it's a very special uh like event um people who stand especially all the spectators from various places they also get a chance to get all those uh broken branches they also provides uh uh seeds of those evergreen trees stickers a lot of fun festive Vibes happen during the tree installation at rockera Center hey Sean thank you and now as I say you will see the tree is covered with scaffolding because they're placing 50,000 multicolor LED lights which will be around like 5 m long wearing and on top of the tree there will be a 900 pound showers which is crazy and right after the Christmas like they chop the lamp uh chop the OOTS and they make home for the people who need home or need some sort of special support so it's for a great cause also now you might be sad that why they cut down the tree uh there is another thing that you might not know that most of the tree that Rocka Center chose it's pretty much end of their lifespan because this tree is pretty much 80 to 90 years old so most of the tree they chose they already end of their lifespan so it's better to cut them down share some holiday spirit share some positivity and then use that tree for some Humanity uh Davey the tree color will be multicolor hello Miss good to see you here parving exactly Nick you are correct we are not far away from Thanksgiving day I'm so excited for Thanksgiving

is such a pain back at Garmin districts right here it's even Sunday that's why a lot of people are here in the city because Sunday usually meter parkings are not affected uh so Sunday is a nice day to be here in the city but you had to be take things consideration that Sunday highways are busy very busy everyone get out with their car Sunday is always a lot of traffic then just like regular [Music] days [Music] these picap drivers are so annoying I know it's fun with those loud music but even though they doesn't have any passengers they playing loud music which is some sometimes very irritating

I'm desperately want some snow here in New York City I really miss snow come on anyone please send some snow to New York Bo girl and why I love up States up States New York is great like a a complete

connected to each other than people who live in New York City hey Rex good to see you here hi to your family Jeff in New York saying I think you are the only New Yorkers who want snow I know right I'm like one of the very few New Yorkers who like snow because usually people get so like irritate so upset come on it's snowing how could I go to the work the trend going to be slow oh my gosh they start panicking and especially I know the pain as well whenever you had a house you had to clean the snow you had to clean your car you had to dig up all the snow in order to get out driving is hard in snow finding a parking is even tougher so snow sounds very fun while it's happening but aftermath of any snowstorm or snowfall is horrible and it's crazy I know that but I kind of like it anyway there is a new burger place it's called seven Street Burger or maybe they just remodel their place I didn't recall seeing it here sting a nice three snowfall is perfect it looks nice while snowing and easier to shovel yeah it is but I want more I want at least a foot of snow otherwise it doesn't fun you know last year I think we had somewhere like 4 in of snow but I need some miserable snowfall I don't care

{"doc_id": "0pdUsguZ", "video_title": "ABC-7 Xtra: The Synod", "video_description": "Read more: https://kvia.com.", "video_transcript": "news comes first this is ABC7 extra good evening I'm so signs and this is ABC7 extra Sunday edition the El Paso Catholic dasis is home to approximately 700,000 Catholics which means that many of you likely attended church today but while many were attending church changes to the Catholic church was discussed during what's called a Cate that's when the Vatican in Rome host a gathering of Bishops and others to discuss such topics as women's participation in church whether or not women can be become ordained deacons right now a male Deacon can marry couples or even Pride funerals women cannot this despite the fact that women make up the majority of the congregations attending church and you may recall Pope Francis made headlines when he suggested that same-sex marriage could be blessed on a case-by Case basis so long as those unions were not viewed as Catholic marriage that leads to the topic of lgbtq and the Vatican stance on that and other issues that have changed since the birth of the Catholic Church while no firm decisions were made on these topics they were discussed tonight a special treat ABC7 extra gets to talk to one person who was actually there during this year's Senate in October that person joins us now for the discussion Reverend Ivan Montelongo who is the judicial VI and vocations director for the dasis of Al Paso Reverend monal Longo was one of many who gathered at the Vatican for the senate in Rome this past October also joining us is suria Carla carra Miss carra has been a representative and organizer gathering information for past sen so let's get underway Reverend let's start with you women right now make up the majority of congregant in the Catholic church yet they don't have the same participation as do men was this part of the discussion the S discussion what was discussed and more importantly what was result hi thank you for having us it is a pleasure being here with you and yes it was discussed uh among many things of course uh the main topic of the Senate was how to become a more welcome welcoming Church a more um inclusive church that gives voice to all of its members and as you said women are the half of of our congregants right they're even the majority of of our congregants in many occasions so how do we highlight their their participation their role and not only doing what the priest says or what the Deacon says right but how do we C cidality is how do we include all of the people of God in the decision-making process how do we um give roles of of uh participation of priority to to everyone so it was discussed yes okay let me turn the question around and ask you how do you include uh women in in the Catholic church and do you foresee um the possibility that women may become deacons so answering the the second uh part of the question first it is a discern process right so the Gathering of the Senate um a senate is an assembly of Bishops right when when they Ponder questions they make decisions but they don't make them lightly they take their time it's a very slow process considering the theology the history all the implications so to answer that part of a question I don't know uh but the pope would remind us frequently in the assembly the protagonist is the Holy Spirit spirit so whatever the spirit prompts in the church uh we we pray that will be what we what we go ahead with but how do we um involve women in our congregation in our church especially it was highlighted that they need to be a part of decision-making processes right that it is not just one person's job to make decisions so in parishes we have what are called uh pastoral councils for example or finance councils and men and women lay people they need to be a part of those uh bodies uh those government bodies also in the dasis we have a diois and finance Council and a diois and pastoral Council and women are also an important part of it they they participate in that way not only of our services but also in the decisions in the decision-making process okay Miss KRA you participated in in these types of or this information gathering process for the sins in the past has this topic come up in the b in the past and what is what is your what are your thoughts on this has it been resolved do you expect more to happen in the future because one of the things that we were talking about off camera is this is an evolutionary process uh we we we're not U I guess conducting the Catholic Mass the way we were 200 years ago or 100 years ago right yes I mean so something that was very helpful to um to me I work for an organization called a piso and Border Interfaith and Bishop Mark had invited our organization to um to help uh and partner with the dases in the senid uh the local diois and CID process but in preparation for that we read a lot of Pope francis's teachings you know um on this and one of the books that we read was called let us dream that Pope Francis um was uh in during the pandemic and he has a very interesting section about his thoughts on the role of women in the church that I think is also very helpful and he says that women are the base many times of the church they are um whether it's formal or informal leadership that they take without the women it's very difficult to have the culture of the church that we see during the Senate process itself you know I don't I can't count exact numbers but there was probably uh more women participating in the formation process of of conducting the Senate um you know so I think that's something to really be lifted up and recognized is that you know these bigger questions I wasn't part of the global Senate but at a local level women are uh very very very much integrated in the church they're the aelas they're the you know they're the mothers they're the ones who are looking aftering about the mothers because without a mother we wouldn't have Christianity right another topic of discussion and very relevant here in the Borderland is the protection for migrants as you well know thousands of migrants are coming through our borders every year what was discussed and more importantly what was the outcome Reverend um migration to migrants migration was a central part of of the discussion and even one of those nights after we finished the the sessions because we would have a morning session and then and an evening session and around 88 7:30 p.m. we joined join Pope Francis in a special prayer for for all those migrants who have uh died especially in in that reality in Europe in the Mediterranean Sea um it was um discussed how migrants enrich the life of a church community and of course we live it here we we know about it here in our reality but one of the realities that struck me was for example migrants in um in the Arabian Peninsula for example in which the church is strong thanks to migrants so the the point of conversation was we should not see them as a burden we should not see them us as providing just help to them but they also have very important things to contribute to our society to our church Community uh it was it was agreed upon that that was the case okay we're going to take a quick break but when we come back I'll ask about the topic of discussion having to do with transgender godmothers or Godfathers was that discussed you're watching ABC7 extra Sunday edition where news comes first there's DNA then there's heavy duty DNA H DNA it's

Denali with $8,000 off MSRP Casa Buick GMC home of the nice guys yeah welcome back to ABC7 extra Sunday edition tonight's topic is a Vatican Senate a gathering of Bishops and others to discuss the future of the Catholic church I also want to welcome back my guest Reverend Ivan montongo who is judicial viar and vocations director for the dicese of Al Paso Reverend Montelongo was one of many who attended the senate in Rome this past October also joining us is sua kalra Miss kalra has been a representative and organizer gathering information for past sentence now another one of the topics uh Reverend of discussion during last month Senate was game marriage Pope Francis has said in the past that same-sex marriage will be considered on a caseby Case basis Reverend what does it mean and what exactly was discussed it was um not exactly that way um what was this discussed especially in the Senate was how do we become a church that includes everyone that is a home for everyone because we talk about the church as a house of God and because we are the family of God everyone is welcome in our church no matter where they they stand no matter what their past has been um everyone is welcome and so uh one of the points of discussion was how do we uh how are we there for lgbtq persons um without judgment uh and Pope Francis has uh talked about this before who am I to judge if a person tries to come to God if a person strives to seek God who are we as a church to put barriers on uh for those people um very Progressive thinking well I would say it goes uh to the roots of the Gospel right Jesus did not reject people who came to him uh especially he was open to those who who had difficult pasts who uh were in difficult situations M uh KRA was LGBT discussed as as much as two years ago as it's being talked about now if you recall I mean you organized uh local senes and whatnot before the the senate in the Vatican was it being discussed as much as it's being discussed today so yeah so when we were organizing the local Senate in elb Paso father Ivon and I work to create um a training for people to learn how to have conversations how to listen to people we call these conversations in organizing terminology house meetings but simply it's a conversation where you want to be as open as possible to hearing other people's lived experiences and time and time again people's lived experiences are that maybe they are a part of the lgbtq community maybe their children are and they spoke about um what their relationship is with the church given their um sexual orientation so there were stories of mothers whose children felt rejected by the church and there was stories of people who felt embraced it really depended on um you know the kind of atmosphere that the church Community was creating but what I thought was very admirable right and what father Ivon is saying also is that I think um what the church teaches what Pope Francis teaches is this culture of encounter that absolutely relies on being open to the full Dignity of whoever it is you're talking to um and really embracing and understanding that there are differences and that it's okay that there are differences and we may have differences of opinion but that there's um there's a commitment to loving all that is very important to highlight right and so I think that that Bishop Mark was open to any kind of topic coming out for people being able to really share that that Pope Francis is leading by example it's just a very good thing for the for the church to be doing okay Reverend was the Israel Hamas War discussed during the Senate and what was the discussion if at all it was discussed um not in particular uh but in general all the wars that are going on because the members of the assembly came from all the world and so there were people coming from the Holy Land there were people coming from Ukraine from Russia from syri Syria uh all these places that have been afflicted by War all these places that in some sense have been neglected by the International Community and so yes it was discussed how we as a church who are already present there can help Advance the peace but also how we as an International Community as uh different countries Etc can advocate for peace can uh we were constantly praying for peace if you follow the the Senate uh Gatherings and prayers uh Pope Francis called us frequently to pray so we had a rosary for peace we had a prayer for migrants we had another special prayer for peace in the Holy Land it was very much at the heart of the conversations all right we're going to take another quick break you're watching ABC7 extra Sunday edition still ahead there's still one other Senate schedule I'll ask my guests if they will take part and what issues still need to be discussed we'll be right back there are trucks and then here's the GMC Sierra available with the connected Driving Experience and the world's first six function

Ivan Montelongo who is the judicial varar and vocation director for the dicese of Al Paso Reverend Montelongo was one of many who gathered at the Vatican during the assembly of the Senate this past October now also joining us is suria kalra Miss KRA has been a representative and organizer gathering information for past senates now Reverend montongo were there topics discussed during last month's Senate that stood out for you that perhaps we haven't talked about two main topics that stood out to me were first the baptismal Dignity of everyone all of us who are baptized have received um a special dignity a new life and so there's a lot of emphasis sometimes in our church about the the priest or the ordained minister but not enough sometimes about all the Ley right because we in the church believe that all of us in some sense are priests so are we all living up to our baptismal dignity are we engaging in the mission of our church or do we are we just content with the faithful coming to mass and then leaving and then coming to mass and then leaving uh we all have a mission and so we need to Foster that discovery of our own mission in in particular and uh another topic was the digital uh environment how we as a church are present or as or are not as present in this new missionary territory which is uh the internet all the um the social media not just um as a means for evangelization for spreading the gospel but really it is like a culture that we inhabit right it is a place that we inhabit that we spend sometimes even hours in yes and how are we as Church being present in that privileged missionary territory just had curiosity what was Pope francis's take on that on the internet and and how we should either be more involved or involve more the internet in in mass or just this discussion of uh Catholicism he was very open um he he says that sometimes uh we as Shepherds and especially him and his ministry as Shepherd we need to let the people of God to find routes right to find the pathways and then follow them sometimes not it's not us who all the time have to be leading but we we have to be led by them as well and I think in this aspect of the internet um he very much is perhaps from the old school right he doesn't watch TV except for like maybe important things but uh but he is very aware of the need to be a a presence a strong presence in in the internet a particular interest as as we're sharing this information about Pope Francis and and his and how he Embraces uh the internet and whatnot there's there's some pictures of you um on your phone showing them to the pope well uh I I came up to him and asked him because I'm vocation director for our dasis promoting vocations to the priesthood to consecrated life so I I told him Holy Father uh would you mind is it okay with you if if you send a message to the Youth of of Al Paso uh about their own vocation and he said sure sure no problem so he's always so open so humble and so joyful he's uh he's a a very funny man too he's he's a great he has a good sense of humor yes he has an excellent sense of humor m c what would you like to see be discussed during the next sen which I and what is the DAT for the next Senate and what would you like to be discussed well so there's a the global Senate will gather again next year right um but in the meantime I think something that's very important to remember is that it there's a codal way of being that I think Pope Francis and Bishop Mark and others are trying to cultivate and to be codal to be a codal church means to be a church that listens and so um you know that's a practice that I think uh in El Paso many churches are continuing to do and develop right so just a couple of days ago um one of the church's Christ savior in the Northeast they have been meeting meeting with parents U who are waiting during the catechism for for or during the confirmation right for to hear what's going on with them what's affecting them what pressures are they seeing and they're hearing about drugs in the schools they're hearing about just this fear around their kids going in the wrong direction so now they're inviting inviting those parents in to be a part of how does the church then um have more uh activity have more things that they can offer for kids to be a place that guides um Children and Families right and so that way of being is something that I think um is is very interesting that there's a lot of churches locally that are just taking up this call to be more cotal to be more open to listening to people and what their what their suffering is what their experiences are one question I neglected to to ask you uh Miss car carra is that the women's involvement in the Catholic church do you think it's enough or do you believe that the the Catholic church should be more inviting and have perhaps female deacons um what are your thoughts on that huh well you know I come at this my work as an organizer right I'm not coming from the perspective of the dicese sure so what I do is to complement you know this process that the dicese has what I think is most important is that there's enough listening to women in the church through the codal process process what their desires are for leadership and that the church takes that into consideration that's the most important thing let me POS a question to you is there enough is are they listening enough do you think it still needs a way to go for us to reach that point I think absolutely to create a culture of listening can't be um done overnight so what I'm hoping from this whole effort that Pope Francis is leading is that local churches really take it seriously that listening to what people's experiences are whether it's related to their gender their sexuality um their socio and E economic status all of that can be cultivated right so it's not just you know that we go to mass on Sunday and go home but that church is this this proactive encountering of others and meeting them where their needs are okay Carla thank you so much as well as for you uh Reverend monel Longo thank you so much for taking time on this Sunday evening to join us for ABC7 extra Sunday

WHAT DO YOU THINK, FIONA? WHICH ONE TODAY, HUH? CHECK OUT THIS MUST STOP SPOT FOR FOUR LEGGED FRIENDS ON BAGHDAD ROAD AND DURHAM. THIS ONE IS ONE GENTLE. THAT'S AMAZING. YOU KNOW, WE LIVE ON A STREET WHERE PEOPLE LOVE TO WALK THEIR DOGS. IT'S JUST A ALL DAY LONG. IT'S A STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE WALKING THEIR DOGS. AND YOU KNOW, A WHILE AGO I SAID, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD PUT A TREAT OUT FOR THE DOGS. PHIL KINCAID HAD NO IDEA THAT HIS SIMPLE ROADSIDE DOGGY BOX DUBBED BY SOME THE BENTO BOX OF BAGHDAD, WOULD BECOME SUCH A HIT. THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING. I HAVE JUST BEEN FLOORED BY THE COMMUNITY SPIRIT THAT'S BEEN TRIGGERED BY IT. SOMETIMES WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THE PERSON THE OWNER IS WALKING AND THEY WANT TO KEEP GOING, BUT THE DOG WILL STOP AND THEN THE OWNER WILL GO, OH, AND THEN THE DOG SAYS, I'M NOT MOVING UNTIL I GET A TREAT. WITH NO DOG OF HIS OWN, PHIL RELIES ON HIS NEIGHBORHOOD CANINES TO TELL HIM WHICH OF THE TREATS ARE HITS. THE BOX ITSELF. WELL, I USUALLY COME OUT EVERY DAY AND CHECK THE INVENTORY, MAMAKE SURE THAT I'VE GOT ENOUGH TREATS AVAILABLE. AND SO I HAVE SIX SEPARATE SECTIONS. EACH SECTION FEATURES A DIFFERENT KIND OF TREAT. I HAVE A REPUTATION TO LIVE UP TO NOW. HE LIKES TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH HIS REGULARS TURNING THEM INTO POSTER PUPS. I'VE ASKED PEOPLE TO SCAN IN THEIR PICTURES OF THEIR DOGS TO US, AND THEN I FEATURE THE DOGS IN THE LITTLE POSTER THAT'S OUT FRONT. SO IT'S TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO SHARE THAT KIND OF COMMUMUNITY SPIRIT. IT HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER. YOU SEE PEOPLE GATHER AROUND THE BOX AND TALK AND SHARE STORIES. IT'S A SENSE OF OF KINDNESS, YOU KNOW, IT'S THOSE THOSE RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS THAT JUST BUILD SPIRIT AND MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD. DOWN THE ROAD. IN LEE, AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, ANOTHER RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS THAT'S JUST FOR THE DOGS. A DOGGIES STICK LIBRARY CAME THE TOWN HAD TWO KIOSKS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO RECYCLE AND GET RID OF. AND I THOUGHT, WELL, HEY, WE COULD USE ONE OF THOSE. SO WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND WE KIND OF THOUGHT, WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA? AND WE HAVE TRAILS BEHIND THE LIBRARY. WE SEE LOTS OF DOGS COMING AND GOING AND MOST OF OUR TOWN ARE DOG LOVERS. SO WE THOUGHT, LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR THE PUPS. IT'S BEEN GREAT. PEOPLE HAVE LOVED IT. SOMEBODY CAME IN YESTERDAY AND SAID, OH, I'M GOING TO GET I'M COMING TO MY LIBRARY AND THEN MY DOG'S GOING TO THE OTHER LIBRARY, WHICH WAS GREAT. SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK, JUST QUIRKY FEEDBACK, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIT OF FUN FOR THE TOWN. IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN FUN. NOW COMING. WANT TO STEP OUT WITH YOUR DOG BUT NEED A SAFE PLACE TO LET THEM RUN OVER IN BARRINGTON. TRACEY BISSON IS JUMPING ON BOARD WITH THE NEWEST CRAZE. IT'S CALLED SNIFF SPOT, AND IT'S A WAY FOR DOG OWNERS TO RENT PRIVATE DOG PARKS HOSTED BY PEOPLE IN THE AREA. SNIFF SPOT WAS AN UP AND COMING IDEA IN THIS AREA. SO I SAID, HEY, LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. GOT MY HUSBAND ON BOARD AND HE DECIDED TO FENCE IN THE AREA AND WE SAID, HEY, YOU KNOW, LET'S HAVE SOME DOGS OVER HERE, SEE HOW PEOPLE WILL RECEIVE OUR LAYOUT, IF YOU WILL. AND IT BLOSSOMED FROM THERE. SNIFF SPOT LIKE THIS IS BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS FOR THEM TO BE SNIFFING. IT'S NOT JUST FLAT LAND. I THINK AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE FOCUSED ON PHYSICAL EXERCISE FOR DOGS. HOWEVER, WE NEED TO BE TAKING A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO DOGS AND THEY AREN'T JUST COMPOSED OF THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE THAT THEY CAN BE INVOLVED IN. THEY NEED TO HAVE MENTAL STIMULATION. THEY NEED TO HAVE SENSORY STIMULATION IN, THEY NEED EMOTIONAL STIMULATION, THEY NEED SOCIAL CONNECTIONS. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE A SNIFF SPOT, WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AS A PLACE FOR A DOG TO MEET MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE NEEDS. PEOPLE ARE SO HAPPY AND SO RESPECTFUL OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND JUST THE STORIES OF HOW THEIR DOGS INTERACTED OR THAT THEY FOUND A PLACE WHERE THEIR DOG CAN JUST RUN AND BE A DOG. THAT REALLY WARMS OUR HEART AND MAKES US WANT TO DO MORE FUN. THINGS LIKE THAT. IN ADDITION TO BEING A SNIFF SPOT, HOST TRACY ALSO OWNS GOLDEN DOG ADVENTURES. WE LOVE TO CREATE FUN AND UNIQUE EXPERIENCES FOR DOGS AND THEIR PEOPLE WITH A FOCUS ON CREATING A WELCOMINGNG AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES INCLUDE DOGGIE EASTER EGG HUNTS, DOGGIE OLYMPICS, EVEN SKIJORING WITH YOUR DOG. HEY, HONESTLY, WE FOUND OVER THE YEARS THAT THE THE BIGGEST EFFECT WE'VE HAD ON PEOPLE IS THEIR MENTAL WELL-BEING. THE ABILITY TO GET OUT WITH OTHER LIKE MINDED PEOPLE AND CONNECT THROUGH THEIR DOGS.

Chris Johnson, discuss the latest in politics ...", "video_transcript": "all right thank you very much time for our Monday morning quarterbacks segment and on Deck today Senator Tim Scott announcing last night he is out of the 2024 Republican presidential campaign shocking some of his own staff with a rather abrupt departure from the race balance of power set to change once again after Senator Mansion announced he won't seek re-election and we have more news just developing from Virginia this morning as well so let's welcome today's guest panelist Fox 5 contributor and Democratic strategist Kevin Walling and Republican strategist Chris Johnson thanks guys for coming in today good to see you thanks for having so our guest that we had last week we said who's going to be the next one to drop out they said well you know our money's on Tim Scott it happened the announcement rather abrupt someone who's on staffers apparently caught off guard um what do you make of this was it just a matter of time when it came to him we'll start with You Chris yeah I mean if you're trying to be the uh non-trump candidate that lane is pretty thin right and so when you're having this broad set of candidates who are all trying to stick in that lane while being pro Trump on the issues while trying to create a contrast Tim Scott did a really good job of that I really loved that his he's a staunch pro-life supporter on these issues uh but you got to win over the field somewhere uh and unfortunately he was the guy that had to drop out are Democrats still watching all of the candidates who are currently debating or are they kind of keeping an eye just on the president uh the former president right now I mean this Democrat is because he works in politics I don't know if many Democrats are actually watching those debates but listen you know Tim Scott's a good guy uh I think he struggled to get into that third debate to your point uh Steve so it was likely that he was going to to to be the next one to drop out put a lot of focus on Iowa that lane just wasn't there for him uh but we're we'll see what happens in the next debate in December so okay so you you said you're going to be keeping a close eye on it who else are you watching do you see any more movement among the candidates who are not named Donald Trump yeah so now I mean it's a question between Nikki Haley and Governor d santis uh and we're seeing that kind of dynamic play out we're seeing almost a repeat of 2016 with these two they're running ads against one another instead of actually taking on the front runner which is Donald Trump so they got to go through Donald Trump first if they want to take on Joe Biden so we're seeing that same Dynamic play out between Rubio Chris Christie from just 8 years ago and we'll see if that actually plays out for them and as far as you know those who are looking at the campaigns from the GOP side of things do you just kind of look at it like you guys okay fight amongst yourselves and what we're really going to back president Trump here or how how are things working out behind the scenes I think most people are assuming that President Trump's going to be the nominee I think that's a pretty decent bet at this point uh but there are a lot of folks who are focused on a wide range of issues who want to see an alternative um because they they feel like that Trump was the guy for the moment like Nikki Haley was talking about uh but times have changed uh the the Biden Administration uh has changed the the you know environment we are in politically and policy-wise uh so we need some new blood uh younger conservatives like me especially would love somebody uh at least within a generation of us and not three or four so it's really the assumption is that it's going to be Trump and we're operating that way but we're looking forward to uh a healthy debate going forward all right let's go from the White House to Capitol Hill right now we've seen some changes uh obviously uh Joe Mansion uh you know he's he's been working with with both sides really over the years uh but it doesn't look like another Democrat can come out of West Virginia right now from the from the Senate and then we got news this morning on the house side of things Abigail spanberger of course representing Virginia for a couple of terms now uh she is not going to seek re-election in Congress she's going to make a run at Virginia governor but that's a seat in that Seventh District that has been very tight the last few elections so how are we looking right now well see uh you know that that seat in Virginia to your point is a bellweather seat uh it's going to be toughly uh uh fought uh you know obviously Democrats aren't super hopeful about West Virginia our bench is not very uh uh long just in terms of uh you know folks coming up so certainly you know it's problematic for Democratic control of the Senate I'm much more hopeful in the house we've got some pickup opportunities not just in Virginia in terms of holding those seats but we got some opportunities in New York and California and things like that so my bet is you know Democrats are likely to lose the Senate just because we're playing on more defense especially with Joe mansion and I think we're actually going to pick up the house come 2024 based on you know redistricting and some of those key races yeah that you you're looking like not completely in agreement with that from your from your viewpoint but it's interesting too and especially when you look at the Virginia Dynamic right didn't do so well in the instate races maybe that changes by the time the next election comes up for the us seats yeah I mean there's a different environment uh a year from now that we can't predict uh but I know in the suburbs a lot of parents are concerned about the way things are being run uh spanberg is in a in a a purple district with a lot of suburban parents who are thinking about those kinds of issues uh it depends who runs and so if you have a republican running that is taking these issues seriously uh not necessarily uh scaring off people like my mom uh and doing things that that she calls mean uh then we have a real shot to flip that seat and I think that's true of a lot of districts across the country all right I want to ask both you real quick before we let you go and you're mentioning the younger generation what is it that you're looking for right now because I mean the way that the the presidential election is set up right now clearly we have two older candidates right that are the Front Runners what are you looking for as a younger voter well I think the assumption is that with younger voters that we want them to moderate that we want them to move to the to the senator especially uh among younger Republicans right uh we don't necessarily want that we just want them to take these issues seriously uh the way that we see them uh as like you know the abortion issue is getting blamed for a lot of the elections last week I'm from Ohio so I get why uh but we want somebody who's going to go on offense on these issues and make the pro-life case the way that we understand I've got a six-month old at home so I'm personally invested in this but I'd love to see talking about child family allowances uh Mitt Romney talks about that regularly uh talking about issues of of family creation and protecting uh women and families uh not making this about just the abortion we got to go but can Democrats work toward the center as well or do you see them working toward the certainly I mean and that's what Joe Biden is known for uh and we saw two years of great bipartisan work on guns on climate on energy security uh and I think that's you know something he's really focusing on all right hope to have you guys both back soon thanks very much I know we'll see you again soon Chris hope to see you as well thanks guys appreciated", "aigc_title": "Political

Current Law allows undocumented immigrants to apply for Green Card #usvisaapplication ...", "video_transcript": "[Applause] [Music] hello everyone welcome back to our Channel US immigration news we hope you're doing great well in today's video we will be talking about did you know that a current law allows undocumented immigrants to apply for permanent residents we explained to you welcome to an eye-opening exploration of an often overlooked law that holds the potential to change the lives of certain undocumented immigrants have you ever wondered if there is a path to permanent residence for those who have been in the United States for decades today we unveil the Intriguing registry law a legal provision that could provide hope and opportunity to those who qualify so to get all the information pay attention and watch the video through to the end please hit like And subscribe and don't forget to push the notification Bell for upcoming episode so without any further delay let's jump into the video did you know that a current law allows undocumented immigrants to apply for permanent residents we explain to you an old law of Congress allows certain undocumented immigrants who have been in the United States for more than 50 years to qualify to apply for legal per residence green card or green card or green card known as the registration law it stipulates that those foreigners who have been living illegally in the United States since January 1 1972 or before qualify to apply for legal permanent residents LPR the law exists and is in effect it has not been abolished says Lilia Vasquez an immigration attorney who also teaches at the law school at the University of California San Diego and there is even a movement to change it and shorten the years not from January 1 1972 but at least from 1992 but they have not managed to move the date that squ is also pointed out that today it is not a law that is frequently used there are very few undocumented immigrants who can receive and qualify I used it about 30 years ago with some clients who were left out of the amnesty and since then I have not used it the amnesty mentioned by Vasquez corresponds to the 1986 immigration reform approved by Congress during the Ronald Reagan government which allowed the regularization of some 2.5 million undocumented immigrants at that time the difficult thing is finding candidates when asked if there are many candidates who can benefit from the registry law Vasquez says that the difficult thing is finding them and he assures that it is a difficult task because many of those who were able to use it for their benefit in the 80s applied for amnesty it was during those years when the date of January 1 1972 was stipulated but now if there are people who can benefit and qualify to request residents the process is relatively easy he said it is not a complex procedure the difficult thing is to find candidates who demonstrate that they have been undocumented in the United States since January 1 1972 and have proof that proves it and practically demonstrate to the government that during these 51 years they have been perfect without a record or any type of fault as if they were Saints who have been living under stones for more than five decades he noted what the registry law is about a report from the American Immigration Council points out that the registration act allows certain foreigners who have been living in the United States for some time but who are undocumented or are present in the country under some type of temporary immigration status to register to receive legal permanent resident status green card to qualify The Foreigner must demonstrate that he or she has been in United States Territory at least since January 1 1972 or before has good moral character and has continuous residence since entry no deportation orders no voluntary departments no crimes no misdemeanors nor anything that makes them inadmissible warns Vasquez the current requirements of the registry law indicate that the beneficiary does not need a sponsor and they must meet the following conditions namely one have entered the United States before January 1 1972 two continuous stay from that date three good moral character five he is not inadmissible to the United States he has not committed crimes that would make him inadmissible submit a form i485 adjustment of status and the fee determined by the immigration service the AIC said that just a few years after the registration date was last moved up in 1986 tens of thousands of undocumented aliens became permanent residents according to government data 58,4 people benefited from registration between fiscal years 1985 and 1985 and 1989 but as the date of registration moved further into the past fewer and fewer people were eligible to apply I added in September 2021 after the failure of Senate Democrats to approve an immigration reform that the House of Representatives had sent in March of that year the ruling party included an amendment to the budget law to modify the registration date and allow that thousands of undocumented immigrants would qualify for residency the initiative was was part of a plan B activated after a negative report from the main adviser of the Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth McDon to allow the approval of the budget and the immigration Amendment with the vote of 51 senators and not 60 as stipulated in the ordinary regulations McDon of argued that the legalization of some 7 million undocumented immigrants suggested by democrats would increase the deficit by E 131 billion over 10 years by creating a class of eligible people those who have been in the country for 10 years or more who will qualify for a grant of parole on the spot after the failure of three proposals delivered between September and December 2021 Democrats abandoned efforts to achieve immigration reform but the hope of changing the date of the registration law does not disappear says Vasa it is currently on the agenda but at this moment it is not on the table for any serious ious effort to make it a reality says wose Gutierrez executive director of the organization full immigrant rights in Los Angeles California for now we are organizing a March in Washington DC for November 14 in which we will ask President Joe Biden for legal immigration relief such as temporary protected status for the millions of undocumented immigrants who were going to benefit from the reform immigration that the House of Representatives approved on March 18 2021 he noted the TPS mentioned by Gutierrez grants temporary protection from deportation and a temporary employment authorization valid for the same period of time as we conclude this insightful journey into the registry law we hope you now have a clearer understanding of the possibilities it presents for some undocumented immigrants the path to permanent residency in the United States is not always straightforward but laws like the registry law demonstrate the complexity and potential for change within the immigration system stay informed stay engaged and continue to seek knowledge about the issues that shape our world that is all for today in this video what are your thoughts on this please let us know in the comments section below thanks for watching the entire video hopefully the information is useful to you see you l later in next episode till then take care in today's informative discussion we unveil a little known but significant law that offers a path to permanent residency for certain undocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States for over five decades name the registry law it permits qualifying individuals to apply for legal permanent resident LPR status commonly known as a green card while this law has been in existence for years it's not widely known or frequently used the threshold for eligibility under this law is quite challenging individuals must prove that they have been living undocumented in the United States since January 1 1972 or even earlier the law also requires applicants to demonstrate good moral character and continuous residence since their entry without any deportation orders voluntary departures crimes MISD deminers or other disqualifying factors there is no requirement for a sponsor and the application process primarily involves filing form i485 for adjustment of status along with the associated immigration service fee while the law once had tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants benefiting from its Provisions the eligibility criteria have become increasingly stringent as the registration date has moved further into the past efforts have been made to change the registration date to offer more undocumented immigrants and opportunity for legal permanent presidency in 2021 Democrats attempted to modify the date through an amendment to the budget law this amendment aimed to make thousands of undocumented immigrants eligible for residency however it faced challenges and was not enacted while the hope of changing the registration date still lingers it's not currently a focal point of comprehensive immigration reform instead organization and Advocates continue to seek immigration relief through other ring such is temporary protected status TPS for millions of undocumented immigrants the TPS offers temporary protection from deportation and temporary employment authorization providing some respect for undocumented immigrants advocacy efforts persist and discussions surrounding immigration reform continue with the possibility of changes to the registration laws date on the horizon stay informed and engaged as we navigate this complex landscape of immigration laws

National Retail Federation and Affinity Solutions to track ...", "video_transcript": "CNBC is teaming up with the NRF and Data Insights company Affinity solutions to launch a real-time monthly tracker of how much and where American consumers spend each month Steve Leeman has the details a decade ago Affinity Solutions a little known company launched into a little known business linking credit card holders with incentives like getting five bucks off a cup of coffee for using your plastic today Affinity is the largest consumer purchased Data Insights company with a massive database that tracks nearly 9 billion credit card transactions annually from 140 million credit and debit cards and more than half a trillion dollars in sales the power of that data is combining with the national retail Federation and CNBC to create the CNBC NRF retail monitor a realtime monthly gauge of how much Americans and where American consumers spend each month it's really giving you the purchase truth and it's allowing you to see what the market is really doing the existing retail data from the government uses surveys and is revised as new data come in the retail monitor it's not revised because it uses actual transactions every month the important thing about this is that we're going to get timely information about consumers and as you know it represents about 70% of all you is economic activity Becky I I I thought of you when we were creating this index you and and I sat together like 20 years ago or more 25 years ago more yeah and we used to argue about what was really going on in the economy and now I think we have a really good I guess mouse trap is the best way to put it I was thinking the same thing when I about it enough about what the data is let's see what it says the CNBC NRF retail monitor powered by Affinity Solutions launches in October with a decline of 8% for retail X Auto and gas core retail we take out restaurants for that down3 retail X Auto gas month on month there you can see that actual versus the prior month. 23 year-over-year 26 versus the prior 4.9 core retail minus 03 sorry about that versus a positive near 1% last quarter year on-year 26 versus 44 let's look at the trend over the past year you can see that it's been coming down um which is by the way a little bit counter to what we're getting in the census data which has remained pretty strong the data has gradually been slowing as year has gone on actually bucking the trend of the government data uh which has shown surprising strength uh looking uh further at the data here what you can see is that gasoline stations down 167 that's what you'd expect electronic appliances down 138 furniture and home also down as well but sporting goods and non-store retailers uh as well as healthc care that was up as well those three sectors doing well guys joining us now we have with us Matt Shay president CEO of the National Retail Federation and Jonathan Silver founder and CEO of affinity Solutions Jonathan I want to start with you because during this process of creating this this uh monitor finding out what you guys did was one of the most interesting things tell us what you do and why you see 9 billion transactions a year yeah so Affinity Solutions is the leading consumer purchase insights company we had an idea years ago of bringing Banks and retailers together to get the retailers to fund the rewards program for the banks that resulted in getting all the data from thousands of financial institutions that data is incredible as you said in your lead in it's 140 million cards it's 8.8 billion transactions a year we track 4200 retailers and it's giving us visibility and insights that are incredibly valuable to retailers we have the leading consulting firms we work with we have marketing companies that use and Wall Street wants your data too you sell your data to Wall Street they're already using your data they do but retail is our big Focus today yeah okay and Matt tell us what the nrf's interest is in putting out something like this well Steve I think our interest is in telling an accurate story about what's happening in the retail industry and how consumers are behaving from month to month and year to year and looking at that over time both especially because of the economic implications but there also policy considerations as well and we've talked you know through the pandemic and in the before times about all of the various holiday seasons uh the holiday weekends the back to school things but over time having accurate data that's reliable and is contemporary I think that looks at detail in a modern way I think is very important I just want to add one thing Becky very quickly which is um as a person who has followed the sensus data over many decades now their data can be revised as big as the actual number comes out we are not revising this data there's no need to because we have the actual data it's actual transactions sorry I interrupt your question Matt the only thing I was wondering are you risking irritating some of your retailers by showing that somebody's doing better than somebody else or is it going to be anonymized so that you don't know beyond just a category so this is an anonymized look at what's happening across the industry but the truth is they already know right because a lot of this to to Steve's Point as you go backwards and one of the reasons that Affinity works so well and is the perfect partner is because over time we can compare this not only with the revised census data but with company's actual reports when they do their filings months later and we see it correlates 0.92 .94 it's I mean it's almost perfectly correlated you're not going what I'm it won't be like showing that Walmart's being Target or that Macy's is losing out to Kohl's or anything along will not show that", "aigc_title": "CNBC, NRF and Affinity Solutions Launch Real-Time Monthly Tracker of American

Ben Mogen has spent ...", "video_transcript": "She was best friends with 21 year old Madison Mogan who went by Maddie. Some described them as close as sisters. She was a senior, a marketing major and a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority. She loved the color pink and planned to move to Boise after she graduated to be closer to her boyfriend. Her father described her as the light of his life. She was the best child I could have asked for. Yeah, we, we miss her so much, unimaginable grief still feels as fresh as it did one year ago. On this day, Ben Mogan thinks about his daughter, Maddie every single day in his first interview since his daughter's memorial. Ben Mogan tells me how he finds ways to remember his little angel. This is the tattoo that I got to remember. Maddie Maddie Mogan. She is my little angel has always been her dad's angel. Having her in my life got me through a lot of dark moments. Maddie is Ben's light, his reason to live. I wouldn't be here without, without her here living his life, but also here and hot not iced at this quarter lane Starbucks. The last time that we ever went somewhere together it was here. There was used to be a table right over here. And that's, uh, that's the one that we sat at. Yeah, every time I even drive by here I, I think about and just how much, uh, I wish she was here with us. Now, Maddie's presence is what keeps Ben going. She was, she was the best child I could have asked for. And, um, yeah, we, we miss her so much. How are you doing? One year after? Yeah, we're hanging in there. We've spent a lot of time, you know, together and thinking about Maddie and, and just trying to, uh, live our, our best lives that he would want us to live, you know, a life honoring the light. Maddie's started shining since the day she was born bright and funny and just fun. She, she was a fun person to be around. She always had lots of friends and, um, yeah, she, uh, she loved music, uh, that she probably got that from, from me. Uh, do you remember what it was like hearing that your daughter was gonna be a vandal? Yeah, I was, I was excited. Uh, it was gonna be close enough that we'd be able to see her, you know, she could come home on weekends and, uh, yeah, but still it was gonna be far enough away that she could feel like she was living her own life and being independent. Last spring, Maddie earned her posthumous degree in marketing. I hereby confer upon Madison May Mogan, the posthumous degree earned. They didn't just give it to her because they were trying to be nice. She earned all those credits and she actually she got that degree. And uh yeah, we're, we're so proud of her still. She just uh she had such a bright future ahead of her. And yeah, you just miss her every day, every day since he first got the call. One year ago, I got a couple calls, one from my mom and then one from Karen and I they're right back to back, you know, the worst things come, it came to my head, but it still wasn't as bad as what it ended up being that day. We remember November 13th, cold and dark, both literally and metaphorically. It's just horrific. I hope no one ever has to go through something like that. But now even Maddie's name, Maddie May, a symbol of light and kindness. Maddie May Day is something that my, my sisters um came up with. We just wanted to have her birthday May 25th be a day that we celebrate and that makes people's lives better. In, in the name of Maddie Mae, a bright spring day that Maddie's legacy makes even brighter. And so every year on that day, we're going to just do a random act of kindness spreading the light. Maddie touched so many with I'll have people come up to me even now a year later and say, hey, I just wanted to tell you how much Maddie meant to me. I didn't realize how many lives that she was able to touch in her short life. Where are you in the stages of grief? Right now, I've been able to keep my head up. It's really easy to spiral down after something like this. 365 days missing milestones with his Maddie May. It's why he holds things like this close to his heart. Happy Father's Day. I hope you have the best day. I can't wait until we can hang out again soon. This was the last Father's Day card. Maddie gave her dad. I'm proud of how far you've come. Thank you for always encouraging me to do my best. Love you lots and lots. Maddie May. Yeah. My mom uh got me a little silver angel wing to uh remind me that Maddie is always with me when I feel that she's looking down on me or that she's there with me. II I say it out loud. I say I love you Maddie or I say hi Maddie or, or something like that. So that uh so that maybe she can, she can know that I'm thinking about her and how mu how often I think about it because it's, I mean, there's not a, I just um she's always on my heart. Her presence lighting Ben's path even one year later. Yeah. So II I tell her hi multiple times a day and, and maybe she can, maybe she knows again. I just want to take a moment to say thank you, Ben. Thank you for sharing your daughter's story with us. I know it was very difficult to talk about this, but your daughter's legacy will live on and we appreciate you being vulnerable and open to talk with us today.

{"doc_id": "0pdf6Q77", "video_title": "Immigration panel discussion (3 of 3)", "video_description": "The Buffalo News hosted a panel discussion on immigration during the Joblio event \"Growing Western New York's Economy ...", "video_transcript": "I also wanted to mention some of the like challenges they might have do you want to move on to that later or yeah go right ahead challenges so uh I'll will just quickly go over few few challenges uh because my assumption is that you are sitting here because you're interested in hiring new talents and talents coming from like immigrant Refuge populations right so those who came to the United States as refugees or immigrants they first first uh barer or first challenge is as you can imagine it's language so language barrier is there and um the more problematic with that is that because they're working all the workers are working they don't have time to invest on their language skills so they cannot really attend um the you know ESL instruction programs so one program I am involved as a program evaluator is like uh Workforce Development program that is run by Erie County what they found is the number one barrier for job promotion for them is that language so uh what they decided is with using the program funding they created an onside the ESF program I think it is brilliant this is great idea I'm hoping that and my to make this program better I wish they created some kind of mechanism that um the employers can support these uh workers ESL workers to attend the ESL program as uh professional development or job training so that they get paid for that time that's my idea one uh the the second thing that that list the the challenges they face is racial discrimination racism in combination with their language skills so I would call it languages so they get discriminated because of their low English skills so one worker had was asked to to work on two machines he was working on two machines so busy and quickly he noticed that next just next to him there were two workers working on one machine how bad is that so he got so frustrated and I was working I was talking with life coach who was working with him my immediate question is that did he get paid more than the other workers no so he tried to make a case that I cannot do this any longer this is too much work for me but he couldn't do it because in this unequal treatment Situation Number One his English is not good enough to make argument about it and the second you know uh some employers prefer certain group of uh refugees to others because culturally some group of people uh assertive is assertiveness is not really encouraged in their culture this one uh on the surface probably there's no problem nothing is Bing up but I don't think it's Can it can be sustainable so last thing I want to just quickly mention is their mental health they need a lot of support in one of our studies what we found is the prise refugees about 50% of them had uh trauma symptoms that warranted for their examination and 20% of them had depression so they look they look okay on the surface but they need a lot of uh the support to continue their job and have the life they deserve in this country one thing that I wanted to mention was that you know uh we're talking about their legal status and what what they go through every body's experience is different we cannot group them in one way or the other so what I would ask of so to many people is that ask that and the best way to work with the Immigrant and refugees are to immerse in their culture if they have they bring you food that you're not familiar with be curious and talk with them I think that they would very welcome to explain and uh you know share what they have they they would be proud of doing that and without our reaching out that the people who arrived here first or Generations before if we don't reach out to the newcomers to them and there is no you know it's it's not easy I have to say that it's not easy to learn about the challenges and triumphs they may have so that we can really work together does anyone else have any thoughts on the challenges you speak about a lot of things that I love to hear and that we live every day in the factr so thank you and and it's critical she had mentioned that trauma is a big issue you have to deal with that we see PTSD among the Burmese and sudanes quite often and to put it into perspective if you're working in an employment agency or a workplace that has uniforms even be careful with uniforms we've had individuals come through the factory on tours and these were young military cadets it actually frightened a few of our refugees because they had grown up in communities where the military and their Nation would Patrol and kill so the one fellow ran into the restroom to wash his face under water to douse water on his face to calm himself down so that exists every day and I look at the individual that from Sudan he just spent 2 and 1/2 months over there because he had to move his mother out of cartoon so you heard everything about the Civil War that was taking place over there he wanted to make sure that she didn't get killed but the frustrating thing is that he could never bring her to the United States as a future citizen without going through a rigorous process so he had to move her throughout Sudan to get her away from the danger so that exists dayto day and what I look at it is employment is an e-word the other ews related to that are as you speak education empathy and engagement and those are absolutely critical when it comes to educate educate yourself first as she mentioned realize what's happening over there realize what's happening in their lives individually it's tough to say to look at what people might consider to be national news here I don't want you to really go to CNN Fox and all that to get your news read his studies on what happened in Burma that was a great series of stories that you did was probably 8 years ago all s y so make sure you go back in time on Google check that out and even there's a blessing we have here being at the border pay attention to the Canadian news they the way that they preface Global News is the way that we have to look at it to understand the people there so once you educate yourself make sure you educate your co-workers because they have to understand so what we did when uh the bermes first came to us it started off as one as you mentioned with word of mouth all of a sudden 2 weeks later there's 15 people from me andar lined up at our door they want to fill out applications so that's how it started that's how it went what we did for the co-workers that exist at the workplace at that time the employee newsletter of that week I did two pages of everything that they live through and Me and Mar and what to expect how to treat them so that way they became educated on those issues but you also have to educate the partners outside of your building as well because you have people that provide services to you whether it's your HMO your insurance carrier and even health services and to put that into perspective for you there was a health uh service organization around here in Western New York to which we would send our co-workers for their pre-employment physical individuals in that office that we later found out would roll their eyes when someone would come in and they would say Burmese Bob conert is added again because they didn't want to deal with the language issues and the other impasses related to that so it took it upon myself to educate them on that so once you go from the education standpoint then you get to the empathy which is related to that you have to understand these issues that fellow from sedan we gave him that 2 and 1/2 months off so go take care of his mother a lot of workplaces would probably perceive him to be disposable and not allow him to come back just say leave and don't come back things like that and then you have to look at different issues one thing that we did it's just a a tiny little Nuance related to the trauma and the other issues of culture we opened up a prayer and peace room in our Factory just 2 years ago and that's so individuals whether they're parents who might be practicing the Catholic faith or maybe Muslims or maybe Hindu they have a place to go and it's also the peace room because when you hear about all these issues that are still happening back home in BNR that gives them a place that when they see it on the national news that may be playing on the TV in the factory they can go up there and rest during a break collect their thoughts and take care of that so that ultimately leads to engagement and just getting her engaged like you're the type of company that I would want to come work for candidly and it just that was so beautifully described I'm curious to understand how your company not only the people that you brought in and and went through the four e and it sounds like you went through a progression yourself it sounds like it's almost changed you as a person um but how is the company benefited if you could list maybe three things that as a result of your passion uh Integrity for these 4 e how has it demonstrated results uh more from a business perspective it for you guys so we relink it today I always tell people all the time there's always the altruism and the good stuff but when you want to sell someone I I always have to look at it from a capitalist big standpoint so when I do that I look at the return on investment when you look at how much we put into someone to get them trained to be that machine operator to be that maintenance person it's going to take weeks months even years at a time when you have someone that's dedicated to being there every single day and ultimately dedicated to you the rewards are going to be substantial and I look at one Burmese individual who left us to go to Fort way Indiana because that's where another significant Burmese population is he left us a note and gave it to us because he couldn't speak too well in English but he gave us a note that said God put us together so that's the sort of thing that makes me feel good because we gave him the chance as I mentioned coming from that that hell on Earth and now coming to heaven we can see the organization develop but we can also see the community develop through individuals so by allowing people to progress in learning English as their second language and ultimately make that their primary language that's pretty special and to see them find financi award one thing that was a struggle and that's why I find your office to be an absolute blessing is prior to that office being created there was an impass where leaders in this County did not know the Peres individuals were here so when Prim hit them they said we didn't know they were here we didn't know that crime is an issue this came from leaders at the county level and also at the city level and that's kind of frustrating because at that time there were 6 to 9,000 Burmese people living in Erie County but they weren't known to exist so were they hidden no they weren't so they need a voice they need representation so by doing what we do with the factory to empower people they can get engaged with their elected officials they can do things that are completely American we had six individuals from mianmar head to Washington DC where there was a rally to talk about the atrocities that were going on in Myanmar had they done that back home they're getting gassed shot at and put in jail so there's a lot of rewards that are the capital rewards but there's also the altruistic rewards and seeing good things happen within our organization within their homes and also out there in the community cuz it's empowerment so ultimately it's taking that from being new Americans scratching off that new and realizing that they are Americans so Bob it sounds like you started with one and and then it grew from there I I presume it's had some impact me because it's difficult to find employees really in any sector at this point I think we have 38,000 jobs open just in Western New York and Manufacturing alone which is a huge impact on our economy here locally but that's every Community across the US so I'm just you know aside you know but you started with one and then went on a journey right many people who have not been used to hiring in new Americans or refugees or a new population that they don't understand you know they as as um I don't even I can't even pronounce your name I'll call you um yeah I apologize but most people have to see the long-term benefits of this to make the investment right in getting the first one on board and that's why do you feel like in educating the rest of the business population here it's important to understand the implications on your business because most of us are coin operated in some way no money no mission in some regards and it seems like you have a very pragmatic um experience that has helped you see what I'm saying people are still going to look at it from a business perspective we can be altruistic but there's still a business implication uh Etc so can you comment on that has it helped ultimately the business yes in terms of uh quality of work is significant because it's a uh generation of workers that were doing Blue Collar work and then when you look at the need for especially in stem category that he mentioned that a lot of individuals working in stem now or actually the new Americans and that comes from survivability leading to Ingenuity so the skill sets they picked up overseas we had one fellow from Bosnia who was in our maintenance department he picked up his skills for Hydraulics electrical maintenance by being in the military over there there were other individuals such as a fellow from Vietnam who actually goes home at night to use his Mill and lathe to make the work knives that our work crew uses to cut plastic he learned that skill set from being an active participant in the Vietnam War back when he was at home and then there's another individual that I know of from Myanmar who actually became a machinist in another organization because the government there trained him how to build bombs and that's a skill set that's kind of not skill set but he transferred it into being a machinist and then also related to that survivability as we look at maybe some enviral issues that might present themselves you take someone that grew up farming in an area that may have been dry there may have been a shortage of water when we look at those issues now impacting the West United States it's that intellect that mindset that we can take from those new Americans apply that to the farming sector as well to survive and thrive working with so to go back to what Darren and Jennifer were articulating earlier so we have government representative and we got International Institute obviously you said this is how it would change immigration what is the is the job permit the biggest barrier to creating the first employee at one of our businesses here in the community and if so are we solely dependent on what's happening at the federal level or is there something we can do as a community that we have control over more control over that would initiate that job applic you know the job permit if that is the number one barrier at least that's what it sounded like Jennifer when you were describing it but we have a government representative here is that a barrier to get the process started with more companies like Bob's can I answer it then I'll let jump in so I I'll answer your question with a yes and a no um yes the job permit is a barrier for the group of individuals who are seeking Asylum because it's going to take them 6 months to one year to get work so I'm referencing probably 600 individuals in our community who are at the hotels or the Viv shelter who are not yet eligible at work so yes that's a barrier however no I do not think that there's a problem for employers here I think there's amble La Supply coming in because Refugee resettlement is bringing people in all the time now and there's an upward Trend there is a political element to this and that we'll see what happens with the next presidential election but Biden has put in to continue to increase that number and as the system gets sourced more people are coming in my agency was asked to give threeyear numbers of projections of how many we could help and so we increased our numbers um of who we would help so each of the four agencies in town that do refugee resettlement have increased their numbers I'm expecting that there will be about 2500 refugees in the next year and then from there maybe 2500 to 3,000 the year after while we wait on a political election cycle that's work they would come in eligible to work some of those are going to be kids some of them might have a medical condition but that's at least 2 to 3,000 people coming in this year 2024 coming up and 2025 um before possibly a presidential change in the meantime there's also other people who will come who will also be eligible to work and those are what are referred to as secondary migrants so an example is the Bengali population that Darren talked about or other refugees so uh we've talked about today populations coming from Burma Sudan Somalia um also Iraqis Afghans Colombians uh there's a list of eight I'm forgetting a few more um Air Trans so they're all coming too Buffalo resettles all of those populations we um we're not limited to one or two populations like for instance Minnesota only takes in Somali we actually here have been open to all so as a family is settled here they may have a US tie that was settled somewhere else and like Indiana or Texas which isn't super friendly and doesn't provide a lot of support so the minute their case management stuff runs out they come here for secondary migration so I think we have a pipeline to give you a quick number answer I think we have a pipeline of 3,000 people coming in within the next next year I think that's going to be buttressed by hundreds of others who will come here for secondary migration if we continue to be a welcoming community and then in the meantime the folks who are Asylum seeking I believe most of them have been put through a process where they're supposed to be applying Andor um have that EAD in process so they may be eligible to work within the next year too so I think we're going to have a bigger labor Supply in the next year while we see what happens with the White House and I want to just give Bob so much credit uh that shouldn't be gloss on over what he's done um that is literally a textbook case study in diversity equity and inclusion uh because you literally took the time um to educate yourself first and which is the most important piece you own the company so for diversity equity and inclusion to be effective typically the leadership has to have the Buy in and believe so also what you did too is in the sense of you made them feel included so you there's your in inclusion part piece and then you're also giving them the tools that they need to basically be able to get the job done like all the other um employees that you have and that's just something again more companies need to take the time to do what you saw was wait a minute have an individual here who works hard if I just put a little bit of time and cultural competency into this and you're like wait wow wait a minute so to answer his question with the bottom line what companies I I I think they're starting to figure it out a diverse company usually a more profitable company because you're getting different things from different angles so what you did you found a group of employees that are hard workers get the job done and you set your quality control one up as well so across the board of that and now it's helping your company Thrive right as opposed to a company who is just say less diverse who won't take the chance and uh pour in some of that Sweat Equity and then something to go back um I I didn't want to miss this one point uh manufacturing jobs you said there was $5,00 th000 in the area right now isn't that weird because think about Buffalo those who are from born and raised in Buffalo remember people about 15 20 years ago were always like well where are the manufacturing jobs at you know I just want to go to high school graduate and then work in the plan and you know we were saying okay you know things are cyclical they changed right they started going into more Technology based jobs and where you had to have some type of degree or certificate or what have you but now the manufacturing jobs are back but people have kind of moved on um if you want to say native B Americans whatever uh have kind of moved on and started looking elsewhere but now here are the manufacturing jobs again but we don't supposedly have people to fill them but no they're out there we just aren't looking in the right places you know and to help or putting in the cultural competency to help make people feel welcome so nice job again I have to compliment you on that okay we are just about out of time so I want I have one really quick question one sorry I work in Workforce Development uh recruitment development retention in exclusively in manufacturing Logistics I've been doing it for 15 years so my question is turnover do you see a reduction do you see increased tenure because I am a huge fan of this I want to make that statement up front right do you see a reduction in turnover with immigrant and Refugee populations as opposed to Native populations yeah the turnover rate is incredibly low they're going to stay especially when you invest in them they're going to invest in you right loyalty right and I think you know there was a statement back here and um this is a piece of data that I use all the time but generally turnover in manufacturing Logistics we will look at somewhere between um it costs about 100 to 150% of their annual salary to replacement per person at $15 an hour State minimum wage right that's $30,000 a year just over so you're looking at about $65,000 per entrylevel warehouse worker right in replacement when you look at training loss productivity all of those things so when you can reduce your turnover rate right you can it's an instant boost to the bottom line and I just add on turnover um and it goes to this whole education and empathy thing that we've been talking about so I I feel like I should mention that while we are a nonprofit The Institute runs a interpreting and translation program so you can hire us um you know gives us money toward our bottom line but we can translate your documents and training materials we can bring in an interpreter for you know training sessions we also run cultural competency programming so we can come in and talk to your Workforce about things like prayer rooms and understanding what people have gone through and there's services like that in this town like we're great pleaseed support us um there's other settlement Partners in town that do that as well joob for hosting this forum also is in this space but there's people here that in our community want to be welcoming and that we don't have turnover at a job or departures from our city right we want this growth we want people here to make buffalo great and so all of those pieces come in making sure that someone who doesn't speak English Today who's gone through trauma can get settled have a nice house have their kids in school have a job that's meaningful to them start saving some money so they can buy their house and become productive members of our community and so every piece of the people who are here today we're all stakeholders in that which is making buffalo great lastly piece on yeah last piece uh if you can help figure out solutions to transportation and English proficiency that's what will help also retention because there often times there's many people who want to work the jobs and do well but they just cannot get their for to get there um so I know Buffalo nagro partnership uh is working on um some solutions with that but those seem to be the two biggest things so you know thank you for having us uh Round of Applause for our panel thank you very", "aigc_title": "Challenges Faced by Immigrant and Refugee Workers:

take on the day today I would say a light extra layer a good idea doesn't look like you're going to be needing a whole lot more than that we're mostly dry and Mild for your Monday get the umbrella handy though you're going to need it tomorrow wet and cooler weather on the way before we see a return to mostly dry in mild conditions late this week a live look outside this morning from the sundow bridge in Reading clear skies overhead or partly cloudy but mostly dry conditions overhead right now we will be seeing the chancef for showers returning again tomorrow so today looking dry you can leave the umbrella at home but keep it close by because by late tonight showers could be increasing across our region temperatures right now in the 40s to mid-50s in the valley 40s to lower 50s in the Foothills we're mostly seeing 20s to 30s in our Mountain zones this morning wind modest and out of the East early on today and wind staying light out of the southeast heading into the afternoon maybe up to 10 m hour or so out of the southeast light winds persist for tomorrow and then we do see them picking up a little a little bit on Wednesday as the cold front moves in and that leaves us with those winds gusting up to around 20 to 30 mph in the mountains and 20 mph gust possible in the valley out of the south for the middle of the work week satellite and radar clouds increasing overnight into this morning so we've got a blanket of thin clouds resting overhead right now a band of showers along the coast but again this is running into high pressure to our east and south that's what's drying us out as that band of moisture moves Inland a more substantial area of low pressure off the coast is going to track towards the West Coast late today into tonight that brings that chance for showers becoming more widespread by late tonight so your hyperlocal futurecast mostly clear in the valley at 8: a.m. with some Thin clouds over buttin Glen County zones Clear Skies over the valley at noon with some clouds increasing in the northern mountains and then some Thin clouds overhead by your commute home not doing anything for us just yet but that chance for showers ramping back up overnight into tomorrow morning by midday tomorrow showers are expected to be WID spread we've got some pockets of heavier rainfall looking likely that persists through tomorrow evening and then there is a slight chance for showers lingering into Thursday or Wednesday and Thursday that is Wednesday morning in the valley heading into the afternoon maybe a little something in the mid Valley seen showers possible Wednesday night Thursday looking to be mostly dry Friday mostly dry as well and then the chance for showers turning Saturday but mostly wrapping up by early Sunday so checking in with those rain totals that are projected for our region through tomorrow it looks like we're going to see maybe up to a quarter of an inch of rain in the valley a bit more than that in the northern mountains maybe a tenth to two10 of an inch in the Sierra and Southern Cascades heading through Wednesday a little bit more looks like we might see rain totals up to around a half an inch in the valley higher elevations to our East not a whole lot maybe a quarter of an inch and then 3/4s than inch close of the northern mountains and heading through this weekend rain totals going up a little bit more but not by much and most of what's falling hit in the ground this weekend is going to be the northern mountains with limited showers across the valley Saturday checking in with what we're seeing for today partly cloudy mostly sunny skies overhead for the northern mountains 50s to lower 60s there 50s in the Sierra and Southern Cascades today partly to mostly sunny as well Foothill areas in the 50s to lower 60s if you're in the valley today temperatures mid to Upper 60s for your afternoon 66 Dees in Reading 68 for Red Bluff wind out of the southeast to 10 m an hour with those partly to mostly sunny conditions 67 degrees for Chico today 68 for Orville and Willows so all around today looking pretty mild but then again get ready the showers are on the way your storm tracker 7day forecast where your weekend's always in view a dip into the 50s tomorrow with showers likely throughout the entire day some of those showers could persist into early to midday Wednesday temperatures though warming back into low to mid 60s after that we've got some clouds overhead but dry with upper 60s to low 70s Thursday mid to uper 60s Friday a slight chance for showers and a little dip in temperature Saturday and then mostly sunny with mid to uper 60 Sunday so Linda this is a mixed bag a lot of fluctuation in the forecast this week the best chance for showers again going to be tomorrow

{"doc_id": "0pdf7sfY", "video_title": "Some car dealerships deterring customers from buying electric, Washington Post reports", "video_description": "Buyers are calling out car dealerships nationwide for being unprepared and reluctant to make the switch to electric vehicles, ...", "video_transcript": "the Biden Administration plans to boost electric vehicle sales by 2032 but it could be in Jeopardy that plan the auto dealers could be the driving force behind a Slowdown that's according to a new article from The Washington Post which found buyers are calling out dealerships Nationwide for being unprepared and reluctant to make the switch joining us now is the author of that piece Shannon Osaka she's a climate reporter covering policy culture and science for the Washington Post thanks for joining us Shannon so I have an electric vehicle and I I you know I really did find one thing to be true in my own experience in your article which is a total lack of Education when it comes to electric vehicles a lot of these dealerships most people are not buying cars brand new they're going to you know a dealership to buy a used car and you're not getting a lot of information so can you kind of go through because you kind of just a several pegs to this why do customers feel like they're being discouraged to buy electric vehicles when they go to some of these dealerships what are they finding so customers are saying that they're going to dealerships and either the dealers just aren't very knowledgeable a lot electric vehicles don't know how to answer their questions or in a few cases that the dealers are actually directing them towards gas cars and there's a few different reasons why this could be part of it might just be training on the part of the dealers of not really understanding the technology but there are also real Financial incentives for dealerships that push them to want to continue to sell combustion engine Vehicles rather than switching to EVs and so you know to me kind of the move towards EV they're kind of like three pegs right you've got the automakers who are investing all kinds of money in like the future of electric vehicles that's partially what some of the strikes were about were you know how do we make sure that our our employees can fit into this new future um you've got obviously the Biden Administration that is gung-ho about this and then the dealerships in the middle um can you talk a little bit about kind of the disconnect you know what's the disconnect between the dealership and these two other pegs and how how challenging or how big of a challenge a dealership can be when it comes to the overall push towards electric vehicles yeah absolutely so we know that automakers have invested hundreds of billion dollars in billions of dollars in this transition it is not small the Biden Administration as you say is aiming for perhaps up to 2third of new cars sold to be Electric in less than 10 years this is a pretty substantial goal but at the same time for dealerships there's a few different reasons why the financial incentives might not align so I talked to a few former dealers who would say things like look selling a gas powerered car can take me 1 to 2 hours it's pretty easy the customer understands the technology they understand what they're getting but selling an electric vehicle can take a lot more visits it can take up to four hours of just explaining to the customer here's how you charge here's the benefits of this vehicle and that cuts into the individual dealers commission which obviously they're not crazy about then for the dealership at a whole there's another Financial incentive which is service so dealerships make actually most of their money from Service Parts labor it's a little bit like you know selling the razor to sell the razor blades they sell the EV or sorry they sell the gas powered car so that they can sell the service but EVS don't require the same amount of service that gas powered cars do a gas car you know you need to get an oil change every 5,000 to 7500 miles but for an EV you might not have your first major service until 150,000 miles and that's a pretty substantial Financial incentive that might not be aligned with the EV transition right it could be a great selling point for an EV but if somebody doesn't want to sell you an EV they might not let you know about that and I think there's kind of another added layer of complexity and it has to do with all these various Federal and tax incentives you know some of them have expired or they've expired only for certain Vehicles because they've sold past their it's it's their amount it's very very complicated and you can understand why you know a Salesman would not want to invest the time into learning all of this yeah the tax credit landscape is a maze it depends on the individual vehicle it depends on whether that individual vehicle was manufactured in the US whether it's battery minerals were sourced in the US and so I also heard from customers who said things like look my dealership couldn't tell me whether the car that I was getting was going to be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit that's a big difference $7,500 could be the difference between you buying that vehicle versus not and so it's a maze for dealers and it's even more of a maze for consumers who might really want to start making this transition but when they go to the dealership and they get confused it's a web of all these tax credits and incentives they might just say look I'm going to go with a regular hybrid or I'm going to go with a gas car yeah totally uh it was really interesting article shanon thank you very much", "aigc_title": "Car Dealerships Hindering the Shift to Electric Vehicles,

{"doc_id": "0pdfKn4d", "video_title": "Big Ten basketball preview and Final Four predictions with Robbie Hummel", "video_description": "In a star-studded episode of Big Ten Country, NBC Sports' Robbie Hummel then joins James Neveau to discuss Purdue star Zach ...", "video_transcript": "[Music] joining us today on the Big 10 country podcast you may be familiar with him in a variety of ways whether it's as a former player for Purdue and a former NBA player currently a college basketball analyst for basically every Network imaginable it seems like including right here at NBC so we were thrilled to have on Robbie hmel today to talk a little bit of Big 10 men's basketball how are you doing today Robbie thank you so much for joining us yeah I'm doing great and thank you for having me I'm looking looking forward to talking some big 10 Hoops yeah and it's going to be just I think an incredible season in this conference I think that there are several teams that are really fascinating to watch of course it all starts with Purdue Gotta Give the uh boiler makers their props where they're do and we can just talk right off the bat about Zack Edy the reigning Big 10 Player of the Year made a big splash when it was announced he was coming back to the school Purdue ranked in the top five in the country this season I think the first first question I have for you Robbie is just a very simple one what else does he need to do at the college level besides winning a title but then there is there anything you'd like to see him kind of work on specifically to kind of take maybe that game and this team to the next level yeah unfortunately he needs like a time machine to get back to 1992 where centers were valued you know and maybe it's starting to come around you know there there are some bigs in the NBA that that are bigger like a Joel embiid or some guys that you know hopefully it kind of switches back a little bit because I feel bad for a lot of these good big guys whether tuner Dickinson or Zack Edy Trace Jackson Davis last year coming back to school and certainly making the nil money that they're making is great and um it's a great opportunity for them but you know look at a guy like Isaac hos if if he was coming out in 1994's got check Somebody's gotta guard hakee Elijah on those big bodies are needed and then the NBA just kind of went towards you know spacing the floor shooting the three and protecting the rims so um as for what he can do more as a college player I mean this is a guy that averaged 22 and 13 last year led the country in double doubles of 27 had eight games of 30 and 10 and I just think that stat is is so crazy you know as a player I I had 130 and 10 game and it was it took the greatest half of my life for it to occur you know I just that's what that's what I needed to do and he did that eight times so you know I think from a number perspective I I don't know how he improves maybe he'll average a few more points but that team is so deep and there's so many options I I would be surprised if it's more than 22 and 13 but I I do think that he's going to be more in pick and roll which certainly is what NBA teams want to see him do um I think he and Braden Smith can be a really good combination in that little twom man action I I think pretty will play a little bit faster so he'll he'll have to run the floor some which I think is also good for his his NBA you know whether it's GMS or Scouts to see him do that um but he's going to be Zack Edy I think he's going to win national Player of the Year again which would put him in the rarest of air being a two-time national player of the year but I just don't see anyone else in college basketball that's going to be able to match his production because he's just so dominant is there anybody else in the Big 10 do you think they can even challenge him for the award in the Big 10 I know there are a few players that are at least of interest but is there anybody else that you think could even come close I I I don't you know Terence Shannon I think is going to have a great year for Illinois um we saw Tyson Walker go for for 30 plus and in Michigan State's unfortunate lost to to James Madison uh but he got off to a great start personally I would say um you know the Michigan guys had had some good performances Olivier Kwa had a nice little welcome to Michigan game with 25 and Doug McDaniels with 22 but I no there's some really good players in this league but I I think it's it's Zack 's award that he's goingon to win again well since you brought up Tyson Walker and you also brought up the Michigan State loss I feel like this is the appropriate time to uh broach the question uh obviously the Dukes big win for them but is there anything that I need to be concerned with with Michigan State they came into the season ranked in the top five really rough loss on your home court to open the season but is this anything that you know we're gonna have to read into or is it just simply a matter of a team just having an ice cold night shooting the basketball and losing to kind of a scrappy young team I'll read into it more if they come out tomorrow which would be uh what's tomorrow Thursday and play poorly against Southern Indiana if that if that happens then I would say all right we we've got some issues here but I will say Michigan state did not start the Tennessee exhibition well and they certainly did not start the James Madison game well so that's something that Tom mizo is is certainly gonna have to shore up AJ hogard has not played well in the exhibitions or in that opening night loss to James Madison which is a bit surprising because I thought in the N tournament he was phenomenal you he ended the season last year playing some of his best basketball of his career uh Jay nens is very talented he did not play well Malik Hall did not play well it felt like end of the game last couple minutes of Regulation and overtime that Tyson Walker was playing like one on five that's that's really what it felt like in watching the game when I went back and watched um they're going to have some issues I think defending really good fives like Ed's numbers last year against Michigan State were ridiculous he he just torched him and Marty Soko is a guy that that plays hard but he is limited I think as a starting center in the league and he's really not all that tall I'm I'm guessing that he's about my height you know I'm 68 I'm thinking he's 68 69 maybe so he's gonna give up some sides to those really big centers um that's certainly a concern but I I do think that Tom mizo is the master of using things that come to him and using them to his advantage and certainly you didn't want to lose to James Madison but I think that if this loss can be used for for something good and positive and they start getting off to better starts and it gets their attention this could be a good thing I'm not hitting the panic button on Michigan state but I definitely want to see them play better tomorrow that that would be a step in the right direction you mentioned Tom iso's kind of deployment of the the group out there uh in the James Madison game I did want to ask you about Xavier Booker tons of hype around him understandably so really highly touted recruit for the Spartans how patient do you think Tom ISO is going to be with him or do we think we're going to start to see him get rolled out in Fairly short order especially like you said if this team continues to kind of get off to some slow starts in these games well the thing is their their depth of centers is is pretty decent you know and I think that they're waiting for one to maybe step to the Forefront Jackson ker with a step back with his injury and I'm not sure when he'll be back but Carson Cooper is going to play and certainly Monty Soko is going to play and I just think Xavier Booker the physicality of college basketball and Big 10 Basketball and then just understanding what's expected of him he's very talented but there's going to be some Growing Pains there I I think that he'll certainly get some opportunities but he's gonna have to perform and you know in the game a couple nights ago there's a couple rebounds that went his way that he didn't secure that led to James Madison buckets and I just think from a defensive standpoint he still has a lot to learn so he'll get a chance but he's going to have to to do his thing and he's going to have to do his within the concept of the team we'll move off of Purdue and Michigan State they're of course going to be the top two teams right now in that conference but probably a few other teams are at least going to be able to make some noise this season one that of course we're going to look at a lot being based in Chicago is going to be Illinois you alluded to uh Terence Shannon earlier Coleman Hawkins is back this season for the Ali just kind of curious from you with their successes in that regard and then also in the transfer portal do you think this is a team that could potentially Make some noise at the top of this conference this season I I do I I do and I I think right now it would be Purdue is one and Michigan State still I look at as as a top tier team I think they're behind Purdue um even with the loss I I think that that's going to end up probably being an anomaly this year but Illinois is a team I I saw him against Kansas and I I came away pretty impressed even though it was an exhibition game their chemistry this year is substantially better I think it's fair to say um you know with with Matt me he's kind of a a different guy I think it's fair to say with the uh you know the the Monster drinks and the the video games and and what you know talented no doubt about that talented dude but he was a different guy um the question I have for Illinois is when the the games get tough what's the point guard situation gonna look like they're playing Ty Rogers who played mostly the four last year he's now their starting point guard uh against Kansas it didn't burn him and I thought it might because Kevin M and Dean Harris can get after you and take your rock so he did a nice job of of hanging onto the ball not turning it over getting him into some offense and with that being said Illinois has got multiple ball handlers you know that Terence Shannon can bring it up Marcus Damas can bring it up Coleman Hawkins can even bring it up so you've got guys and then on top of that Dre Gibson law horn played really really well Dre Dre Gibbs law horn played really really well uh in their opening night win against Eastern Illinois I think they go 10 Deep I think Brad Underwood got great depth um Luke goody is a good piece to have back Quincy gerer played really well in that Kansas scrimmage he's been great by all accounts in terms of a leadership role with that team and then Justin Haron comes over um and has played a lot of college basketball has a lot of experience uh and we can't forget Dan danger you know he is back for uh the danger zone is back for another year so a lot of talent um and it seems like they've mesch together better than last season my big question mark with them is going to be the point guard play and I'm still not sure of their shot selection they L the three-point shot last year we'll see uh if they find a little bit better balance this season you know I'm glad that you said it and I didn't have to like coming from you it's a super Fair criticism and I definitely agree with it's fair from anybody I think anybody could have said that one I I did want to ask you you mentioned the Monster energy drinks and kind of like the video game mentality what fueled a Robbie hmel in college I am genuinely curious about this boy um probably Papa John's and cocacola I would say that that would probably be I was I've never been an energy drink guy which is comical because I did have a Red Bull endorsement deal at one point while playing three on three um so I I've never I don't know I don't like the feeling of my heart beating fast and the amount of caffeine kind of freaks me out uh so I I've never been an energy drink guy but I definitely we ate a lot of Papa John's Pizza um on produce campus and uh we we played a lot of different video games though we played Call of Duty we played a lot of NHL like NHL uh it wasn't it would have been just 10 I guess NHL 10 NHL 11 the EA Sports Game and played a lot of NBA NBA 2K who's your go-to team in NHL well the thing was and actually this would have been for we had the NHL 2K9 and then we switched over to the EA but when we had the 2K version my roommate and I was one of our athletic trainers we did like the think of NCA football how you could do a two-player franchise but we would create ourselves so so he created himself Pete der and he made himself a defenseman and I created myself Robbie hmel I was like left wing no yeah left wing so I'm Ry and I made myself 68 and just a 99 at everything which I don't know how he let me do because he was more and he's Canadian and actually like knows hockey and has played hockey I've never actually skated on ice with a stick I've skated but I've never done it with a puck or a stick and I just gave myself all 99 so I I was like the greatest offensive player or offensive weapon the NHL's ever seen but uh I was always the Blackhawks the Blackhawks my team duy noted I just I was imagining to myself a six foot eight guy skating around as a left wing it's not super common in the NHL and I say but like just on steroids like that's what I was thinking of myself I was gonna say zido charara is like the r exception and dude can apparently run marathons ran a 330 he's an unbelievable athlete that guy was a beast man sorry any I did not mean to derail this conversation having having played uh video games with a couple of guys down at ufi back in the day I was kind of like all right what games was a Robbie hmel playing so anyway back to the current season um it's been a few years since we've had a big 10 team in the final four much less winning the national title I mean it's been what two decades since Michigan State woned all I'm just I'm going to put the question to you as succinctly as I can this year who's your final four looking at kind of the road that we're going to be going towards March um so let's see I did this I'm G have to remember who I picked I went Duke because I think they have the most Talent of anybody in college basketball I went Tennessee which probably was an overreaction to watching the Michigan State Exhibition game but I think if they're even remotely better with some with Jordan gy and Dalton connect offensively I know they're going to guard and I know Rick Barnes can really coach so I went Tennessee I went Purdue we got the Virginia thing going on totally unbiased from from me and who was my fourth team that I picked um oh I picked Houston I think Houston's a team that's flying under the radar and I think Kelvin Samson's one of the best coaches in college basketball and I I really like their roster uh Jamal shed is back to run the team LJ CER comes over from Baylor Damen Dunn transfers in and then on top of that they still have Joan Roberts they still have jier Francis and I think Terence Arsenal could be a guy that that breaks out and is one of the you know really breakout players of this year's college basketball season I I am obviously gonna just say that those are all really solid picks I can't you know potentially quibble with you of all folks uh Robbie um really appreciate you obviously coming on the podcast today the last question I kind of had for you was do you think that if Purdue gets to the to the final four you think they can do this you think they can win that national title and end that big 10 drought in that game yeah I mean if you're good enough to get there certainly you've got to be quite the team to do that and I think once you get to Saturday night and in you know the last weekend of March or first weekend of April you certainly your chance if you've got the national Player of the Year and you your freshman guards from last year are you're older and Braden Smith and Fletcher lawyer I think Lance Jones gives them something that they really haven't had a guard with some burst and that can really defend and honestly I'm I'm curious about his three-point percentage this year because he took a lot of tough deep contested threes last year at Southern Illinois so with Edy and with some of the players he's playing with at Purdue as he gets more open looks I think Purdue is hoping that that percentage raises you know he shot 40 42% as a sophomore um was one of the top guys the Missouri Valley but uh that was down to like 27 or 28 last year so they they need him to bounce back in terms of shooting the ball but they really like him and then I think their young players really raised their ceiling you know miles kovin Purdue fans know him well Roosevelt coven's his dad who played for the Bears and the New England Patriots uh his sister's a terrific volleyball player at Purdue um so Miles has some good genes he's he is gifted athletically and there there's no doubt about that he also is pretty skilled and can make shots he's not afraid um I think he's a guy that's looking to get shots up he's aggressive as an offensive player and then I I really liked cam Heidi the other night I just think that he's a guy that red shirted broke his foot his senior year of high school ended up red shirting last year's top 150 kid but he's 67 can straight line drive into the rim he's really a good athlete and he can make a shot from the perimeter so I just think that those two guys with their skill set and athleticism give them something that last year's team that was lacking athletically in the back court you now you've got two guys that that don't lack at all athletically and I think if you throw Lance Jones in there he's he's got some burst too so um yeah if they could get to the final four they could certainly win the national title Robbie hmel you can find his work in

showers as the front pushes through but notice this is light this is spotty just like we've had in the last several rounds with systems that have come our way so Friday morning we may have a shower or

{"doc_id": "0pdj47bZ", "video_title": "Steelers beat Packers: Postgame analysis at Acrisure Stadium", "video_description": "Pittsburgh's Action Sports anchor Emily Giangreco and TribLIVE sports columnist Tim Benz talk about the Steelers' 23-19 win over ...", "video_transcript": "Pittsburgh's action sports here at *** stadium and joining me is that trip, live sports columnist, Tim Ben. We are going to break down the Steelers win over the Packers today. 2319. The final first Tim let's talk about the run game because we have seen quite the change in that. Yeah, they've been really good the last two weeks that started against Tennessee on Thursday night and they carried it over to this game against the Green Bay Packers today. Isaac SIA Aller said something interesting to me after the game against Tennessee where he essentially said it was *** good thing to have that great game on the ground against Tennessee going into *** long weekend. So they could look at the tape and analyze what they did right after so many weeks of just looking at the tape and seeing what went wrong and saying in theory where it had to be better. Now, they had *** game's worth of tape after 166 yards against the Titans where they could point at it and say this is what we need to do again next week and they did, they did it even better. 205 total yards on the ground. He had 82 from Harris. He had 101 from War and *** couple here and there from Pickett. And largely, I think that was the most important part of today's game was for the second consecutive week leaning into the run game, especially since the pass wasn't there getting behind the offensive line. Broderick Jones has been really good on the right side since he's begun to start there. And this is about the same time last year where it began to coalesce for them in the run game *** year ago. It was not after the buy this year, which happened in week five, but last year, week eight, after they started off two and six, the big reason why they got back into the hunt before being eliminated late last year is that run game got going in about week eight. You know, Naji Harris also said something after the game, he said that they finally found their identity within the run game and we did see that here tonight, but something that they're still searching for identity wise is the passing game you kind of brought that up earlier. Yes, it was not 1/4 quarter, Kenny for Kenny Pickett just in general. The pass game never got into *** rhythm. He only had 14 completions and 126 yards roughly or whatever it was for Pickett. Now to be fair. He did have *** really nice pass right about where we're standing right here that Deonte Johnson almost hauled in couldn't bring it in was contested *** bit. You would hope that their second best and worst receiver and Deonte Johnson might make that play, but it didn't happen. Now, that would have really helped the cause for picket. He also had *** crucial conversion to George Pickens that was wiped out because of *** fairly ticky tack offensive pass interference call that was labeled on Calvin Austin. So, you know, the numbers could have looked better for Pickett in the long run if you kind of factor those things in. But what happened happened? Well, the good news is even when the passing game isn't there, the defense is always there. However, we did see some unfortunate news tonight, Juan Alexander, obviously injured with, you know, *** reported Lee's injury. Just what does that mean for this defense and the future of it, it means here we are again another year where the inside linebacker position becomes *** question by season's end this time through no fault of their own because I kind of like the job that they did in assembling that trio to address the problem. Now it would be nice if they just had one guy that stayed healthy. I mean, even when Ryan Shazier was here before his significant injury that ended his career, he did have injury concerns throughout his time here in Pittsburgh, it's *** tough spot to stay healthy, which is why you need reinforcements. They thought they were well girded in that position, but with the loss of Holcomb last week and now Quan Alexander this week, you're down to Mark Robinson and Landon Roberts, both very good players against the run, but nowhere near what you could get with the different permutations of having Holcomb out there, Alexander out there and dotting in some of the safeties, they're going to have to get creative to get around this problem against these two AFC North teams coming up with the Bengals. Well, let's talk about that, you know, looking into the future, what does this win? Big picture wise mean for the Steelers? I think it's huge that they got out of these four games coming out of the bay with *** 3 to 1 record, two of three at home. It's greedy to ask for five wins in *** row in the NFL, which if you date back to them, beating the Ravens before the buy would have been the streak that they'd be going on into these road games against the Bengals and Browns. Now getting four or five is pretty good. And what they've done is they built nice little cushion here in so far as if they don't get the results that they want. If they don't even split against the Ohio teams, you're still above 500 when the schedule kind of eases up *** bit before you get to *** real tough slog over Christmas. They have three tough games to close out the regular season. We will keep an eye on everything that the Steelers are doing. Thankfully, it looks like they're moving in the right direction. They got the win tonight here at *** stadium 2319.

they all made news this very week in decades past Dave McKinley remembers when those stories and more were all news to you 10 years ago this week sporting the worst record in the league the Sabres fired 17-year general manager Darcy regir and Coach Ron Ralston and brought in pad laof Fontaine and Ted Nolan the return to Buffalo of these two fan favorites though would be shortlived Bill's fan Robert Hopkins became an internet sensation for falling off the upper deck at the stadium while sliding down the banister at a game and was later convicted of assault and reckless endangerment for injuring a fan he landed on below it was also the week that we learned through a shocking admission what might have been behind the increasingly bizarre behavior of Toronto's mayor Rob Ford have you purchased illegal drugs in the last two years yes I have after which the city council stripped him of most of his powers this week in 2013 20 years ago this week this bygone Buffalo restaurant was the scene of a visit by a very important person who prominent Republicans were eager to see and who attracted interest from onlookers all I think that's wonderful somebody can get to see him now I didn't know who it was I knew something was going on we seen all these cars coming in we thought it was Louis simonelli this week's news to you Pop Quiz who do you think was coming to dinner and name this restaurant that no longer exist which hosted the event and here's a hint this guy who worked at a postal facility near the airport where the guest of honor landed was attracting a lot of attention due to his uncanny resemblance to him it was also the same week we learned of trouble in Neverland dozens of investigators descended onto pop star Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch the investigation comes after abuse allegations from a 12 or 13-year-old Los Angeles boy eventually charged with sex crimes against a minor two years later the King of Pop would be acquitted at trial and we lost the great Art Carney hello boys at the age of 85 this week in 2003 30 years ago this week dozens of members of United We Stand pound to the pavement in Williamsville this afternoon making it clear exactly how they feel about NAFTA that would be the North American Free Trade Agreement they believe by lowering trade tariffs NAFTA will send American jobs South to Mexico While others believed lowering tariffs would open Mexico's Market to America Amic goods and create jobs here the answers may not come for months or even years if nothing else the debate over NAFTA supported by President Clinton highlighted again the old adage that politics can make for strange bedfellows Top members of Clinton's own Democratic party supported by labor unions led the opposition the president's usual enemy Republicans fought for him you know this was unusual it's not often you find Bill Paxton and Bill Clinton on the same side of an issue and with Republican support NAFTA won narrow passage in Congress this week in 1993 our local history is packed with stories of Big Ticket projects that never came to pass and this might have been the mother of them all which also spawned the mother of all lawsuits which came to trial 40 years ago this week we're talking about the multi-purpose dome stadium with theme park and hotels which the county agreed to have developed in Lancaster as a new home for the bills in 1969 but after it then chose to build an open air stadium in Orchard Park developer Ed catrell sued for breach of contract it took 14 years for this case to get to trial which then took another 42 weeks to complete when it concluded Katrell was awarded $53 million which after another 5 years of appeals was reduced to 10 million ending a legal battle that raged for 19 years it also demonstrates the debate in recent years about whether the new bill Stadium should have a cover or not is not a new one at all but one that was kicked around many years before the days when it was all news to you look at that reveal with the Dome so here's the answer to this week's news to you Pop Quiz the VIP who came to Buffalo 20 years ago this week I think you figured out once you saw his look alike right it was Vice President Dick Cheney who attended a republican fundraiser here we also asked you if you recognize this restaurant that's no longer there where Cheney appeared it was of course the Park Lane which was torn down in 2008 but people still talk about how great it was all the time what's there now I wonder um I think apartment it was in Gat that that gentleman looks exactly like yeah he did so

down the 49ers' decisive victory over Jacksonville, the immediate impact Chase ...", "video_transcript": "yes this is 49ers talk brought to you by bigo tires Matt mioko Jennifer Lee Chan and this was more the first five games of the Season 49ers than the previous three games of the Season 49ers coming to Jacksonville and really handling the Jacksonville Jaguars in a big way 34 to3 and they got out to a fast start the defense was playing lights out I mean the after the first two drives of Jacksonville Jags they were negative one yard three and out two times in a row so the defense was coming out with a lot more speed they had a lot more energy across the board and like you said all around much better game for the 49ers I know she call them the Jack Jacksonville Jags because there's always that is a Jaguar is it jaguar or is it Jaguar yeah it's confusing it's jaguar and the Jaguars were not good no they were not 49ers made them look bad in a big way uh Trevor Lawrence the number one overall pick in the draft from three years ago was completely outplayed by Brock pie the what 262 pick up last year uh the defense had quite a spring in their step when we talked to John Lynch after the game and he kind of felt this coming on Monday right feeling just kind of the renewed enthusiasm maybe the legs back under this team after the bye and there's got to be something to be said for kind of getting into that losing you know series when you've like a rut yeah I think that's what really what it was like they couldn't get out of it they couldn't kick it for that third game I really thought they would come out with more energy against the Bengals in that last loss of the three but they didn't and they all talked about how they had a a lesser amount of energy and Kyle Shanahan said they looked slow and sluggish on the game film and then on Monday after the byee they did come into the facility and more energy and I think Chase young kind of gave them a little jolt of energy I think the week off gave them a jolt of energy and you saw it on the field with a much faster quicker more dominating pass rush which is what they are known for okay and maybe you know what I know the 49ers tried to downplay it but maybe having Steve wils the defense coordinator on the sideline gave them a little something too I mean they try they tried to downplay it so much but if it wasn't an issue they wouldn't have done anything they would have kept him up in the in the coaches but he moved down to the sideline it looked like they had a really good plan on both sides of the ball like offensively defensively everything it really kind of lined up but you know the addition to of Chase young is one thing coming over in the trade but also the changes they made to the defensive backfield moving Isaiah Oliver out of the lineup as far as the nickel back goes and this was key in this game because the Jaguars you know they're probably their biggest threat other than Travis etn the running back is uh Christian Kirk the slot receiver and so what the 49ers did was their base defense is always going to be charvarius Ward on one side dador Lenor on the other side and in this game they went back to something that we saw earlier in the season which was moving Lenor inside to cover the slot receiver on those nickel downs and then bringing in Amry Thomas to cover the outside receiver and I I mean all things considered the the pass rush tying together with the coverage on the defensive back field um a healthy Dre green law or healthier Dre green law Fred Warner who's around the football and getting his third interception of the year it really was a complete team effort on defense summed up by this stat the 49ers forced four takeaways in this game they only gave up three points I say whenever you can create create more takeaways than you give up points you have a really good chance of winning that game yeah you do uh and it could have been even a bigger performance if not for the uh encroachment from the players from the sidelines score touchdown on that drive on the drive yes but it could have been a defensive touchdown yes oh yeah right so the defense scoring defense could have scored more points than exactly than the Jaguars offense right but of course when Amry Thomas got the interception running down the sideline yeah Forest fumble and then picked it up and started running for it that's right um everybody from the bench area started coming out on the field including Kyle Shanah yeah he could not yell at anybody because he was he might have been further out than uh who who was out there like d winers and and uh Jer Brown I think was out there as well I saw Johnny Holland out there but it looked like maybe he was trying to pull somebody back but I think Kyle Shanahan was further out on the field than anybody right so because they were out on the field they got called for unsportsman like contact the touchdown was called back so the defense could have scored more points than the Jacksonville Jags did yeah so but the defense I mean it really was it's probably Javon or Javon hard Graves best game uh it probably was Nick Bose's best game uh Eric Armstead Cleland furl uh I mean everybody kind kind of got into the mix where the 49ers pile up five sacks of Trevor Lawrence a guy who usually gets rid of the pretty quickly and he's a mobile guy it's not like he's you know someone who stands in the pocket he actually can run around a little bit and buy more time but also Chase young Nick BOS of that group getting after him faster the defensive backs didn't have to cover as long yeah and but I think both and I think also the defensive backs were good enough that Trevor Lawrence held on to the ball longer than he wanted to as well so it really that was a very good uh situation where where the both ends the the front end and the back end kind of meshed together right um and Chase young I I you know he didn't fill up the stat sheet he did get the half sack where he and Bosa got to Trevor Lawrence like almost at the exact same time kind of reliving their Ohio State days he said to me in the lockr it did feel like old times did it yes yeah and you could tell like you always take the video Jennifer always takes the video of the team coming out with the bump box and they're playing the music he was right up there at the front yes was he doing the gritty I think was he was definitely dancing with Trent Williams and Deo samma and he did say in the locker room after the game that he has felt incredibly welcome and it's been one of the easiest transitions he's made in his NFL or actually this is only the transition he's made in the NFL but just in football in general just the welcome he's gotten from the entire team and of course the defensive line has made him feel very welcome and he has non-stop been talking about what a change in culture it is is with the for ners yeah so Bosa one and a half sacks hardgrave one and a half sacks Cleland fural a sack and then Armstead and Chang each have a half sack um and that doesn't even tell you know all the story you mentioned Amry Thomas's Force fumble and a fumble recovery Nick Bosa had a force fumble and a fumble recovery and then interceptions by taleno huanga and Fred Warner so this was really I I won't say that this was the 49's best game of the year because remember week five when they destroyed the Cowboys and everybody was talking about 4ers going undefeated nobody was really talking about that but I just kind of threw that in there um but you know that that was when everybody was like oh the 4ers are clearly the best team in the league this looked like much more like that yeah this looked like a team that was firing all all cylinders they were playing complimentary football and they were good in All Phases of the game there's been in the last three games where it was the losses you saw issues on in all three phases of the game and so there are a lot of familiar faces in the Jaguars organization with Trent B's the general manager there are scouts there are people on the you know the the medical staff like there's all kinds of uh former 49er people uh with the Jacksonville Jaguars and one of them before the game said to me wow the bye came at a really bad time for us you know the Jaguars because they were hot they were on a five game winning streak  coincidentally enough in which each of their games was in a different Stadium because they played two games or one two games in Germany or one game in the UK one game in Germany in back toback weeks they you know they had one home game and then a few games on the road and then what I said right after that person said that I said well I think it might have come at the right time for the 49ers and so you got this kind of you know you have that a team that was really cold a team that was really hot they both have their bye at the same time and now it looks like they've just they're going back in opposite directions yeah yeah it really is interesting and uh I gotta say I think also part of the energy for the 49ers was how much red there was in Jacksonville there were so many 49ers faithful in the stadium and once it kind of got out of hand all the Jaguar fans left and all you could see was red in the stadium so jaguar or Jaguar either yeah the Jaguars uh however you pronounce it they were 30 4 to three losers on Sunday to the 49ers um a lot to talk about on this episode of 49ers talk the defense certainly um I don't I don't even know if I'd call it a bounceback game for Brock pie in the sense that you know yes he did not play well in the fourth quarter of those games the 4ers Lost although the game against the Browns he led them down the field for the potential winning points that that that uh went astray off of uh off of Jake Moody's foot the thing about those three losses there it was not that he just played awful in the entire throughout the entire game he had good play in all three of those games but just those few turnovers were incredibly impactful to the score yeah and the last time that uh well the forers played um that game against the Bengals I think it was the next day day uh Kyle Shanahan was asked if Brock pry was still the quarterback of the team still the starting quarterback um well let me tell you where Brock pie ranks in the NFL right now okay after week 10 where the 49ers beat the Jags Brock pie is the number one rated quarterback in the league with a passer rating of 10 n. n it's not too shabby Brock pie is number one in the NFL averaging 9.3 yards per pass attempt Brock pie is on Pace to be a Pro Bowl quarterback and and when was the last time the fors had a Pro Bowl quarterback that would have been Jeff Garcia a long time ago that is a long time ago you know like 20 years ago that's how long it's been and that's an incredibly long time and and here's the thing this is a little bit counterintuitive watching the game that first drive 49s three and out now they go down the field it's a quick Fourplay 57 yard touchdown drive and pretty makes this throw that I I it didn't seem like a real well advised throw to make but it was a great throw and a nice catch by Brandon iuk in the back of the end zone for a touchdown that was a 13 yard touchdown it was one of those throws that everybody in the Press Box was like oh jeez when it left his hand you're like oh right into traffic it was yeah George KD and Brandon iuk were there but there were also two Defenders there at the exact same time so it was like a mesh of four people I I would describe it as like you know the the Kyle Shanahan on the sideline going no no no but probably also throwing in some words and we can't repeat yeah and then I don't even know if he said the yes part yeah cuz I he was I think he was Furious Brock pie for making that throw in fact this is what Kyle sheenan said he described Brock P's touchdown pass as one of the worst decisions he's made since he's been here ouch and and Kyle's like well I can say it now because it ended up being a touchdown but it wasn't it was a great throw but it wasn't a good decision right well so that was his that was the blip whenever your blip whenever your worst play is a touchdown pass you probably had a pretty good day yeah a pretty good day from Brock yes okay so here we go Brock P's numbers he was was 19 of 26 296 yards three touchdowns no interceptions passer rating of 148.9a perfect that is that's darn good and then Trevor Lawrence on the other hand his passer rating 48.8 um so rough day for the Jaguars yeah offense um good day for the 4ers offense defense and speci teams um the only thing and I loved what Christian mcaffry had to say he came to the podium after the game and said man I suck I'm the only guy who didn't score a touchdown yeah and so his team even though they tried so hard to get him the ball okay yeah okay so you had Brandon iuk scored a touchdown KD scored a touchdown Samuel scored a touchdown yek scored a touchdown no Christian mcaffrey and we're sitting there watching the 49ers just try to Force feet at touchdown to Christian mcaffrey so close yeah I I I just don't know how wise that was probably not I mean yeah but does it also show though that I like does something like that kind of win not that he needs any brownie points from the locker room but does it also kind of make guys like Shanahan even more for doing something like that I think so I think it you know it makes him not that he's not human but it makes him more human I think he's so diligent and like everything he does is not I'm not going to say robotic but he's so such a a well he's he's a young kerin yeah yeah Ian kind of like he's kind of like you know he can be kind of grumpy and kind of you know Rough Around the Edges right um because there's right and there's wrong and there's his way and like this way makes sense and so don't do it that way but I think that you know what he showed trying to get Christian that the record I mean he's tied which is still impressive Len Moore 17u games regular season and postseason with a touchdown the fact that he joked that man I really wanted to try and get it to him and Brock py also spoke to us afterwards and said yeah I mean we really wanted him to get it but you know brocker even felt bad about Kyle yusek getting the touchdown because it could have been Christian mcaffrey but I mean at least Christian mcaffrey had a good sense of humor about at the you know what I say let Christian mcaffrey not have a touchdown spread the wealth around a little bit all those other guys are happy and you know what mcaffrey had himself a good game too I mean 16 carries for 95 yards uh 5.9 yard average so it's the first time the running game has gotten going in a little bit oh much better probably no coincidence that Trent Williams is back on Ando Samuel and Deo Samuel back on the field Deo Samuel had a 23 yard touchdown um so uh when I talk talked to Trent Williams on Friday I gotta say I did not think he was playing he did not seem confident at all I mean I asked him Point Blank do you think you're going to be able to play bottom line Tren do you think you're going to be able to play and he goes I really don't know and he said that he didn't feel as good as he would have liked on Thursday and Friday and so when he came here he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to play but then he felt like 75 80% of him was enough for him to get out there and I think that there was kind of some ownership from him like I want to do something to help this team get out of this three- game losing streak and it wasn't anything against Jaylen Moore who filled in pretty well uh for Trent Williams but he just he wanted to get out there and I think it's a different team now when you have Trent Williams a left tackle and dvo Samuel absolutely running around wherever dvo Samuel is lining up it just they just look different they feel different well you mean you look at Christian McCaffrey's average yards per carry before without Debo Samuel without Trent Williams it's well below it's four I think 4.5 for the last game but it was two or three yards per carry and it wasn't until this game not only his yards per carry but the yards per play of the entire offense much bigger than it has been in the past the 49ers put a lot emphasis on trying to finish the first half strong and keeping the ball for a long period of time especially when they win the opening toss and then they they'll defer and they get the ball at the beginning of the third quarter so they're like Kind of Perfect remedy is to just hold the ball for as long as they can and finish with points and then not allow the other team to touch the ball and then they come back and and get the ball right they work that thing to perfection on Sunday in Jacksonville because they did they the Jaguars scored their only three points of the game that was with 420 left in the first half the 49ers took over and sure they wanted to score a touchdown but they methodically drove down the field took time off the clock then they had the the intentional grounding penalty that kind of kind of backed them up a little bit yeah made it so that a touchdown wasn't going to be real likely but they were still able to just kind of milk the clock a little bit and then finally get the field goal which was a weird sequence of events because uh Jake Moody kicked a field goal or the the the Jags called a timeout he still went through kick the field goal it right down the middle and then TV was like hold it we haven't we need more time to fit in a couple more commercials but they didn't get the signal to the game officials yet so once again snap back to the holder boom right through the middle no that's not good either we got to got to do this again the third time his kick like went right over the upright barely made it in but that's how they ended the first half so the 40 Ys take that lead and we were talking about how fast of a first half it was until the two-minute warning well that's why they had to get all those commercials in right it was a really fast half until the two- minute warning and then the 2 minutes lasted for about 20 yeah and so that gave them a 10-point lead 13- 10 13-3 and then the 49ers get the opening kickoff of the third quarter and really made quick work of this and I think that that's right then uh that's when the game was over when the 49ers were able to make it essenti they basically scored 10 points in one possession and the 66- yard touchdown pass from pie which was a really good play because uh the 49ers knew it was a second and one they knew that the Jaguars always play Man coverage and that down in distance where that is that was Kyle Shanahan saying hey I know what defense are going to be in let's run this play and it was it was George KD against Devon Lloyd a linebacker and there's not a person in the 49s organization who wouldn't want the ball to go to George KD whenever he's man covered against the linebacker yeah he says he said in the lock afterwards like I'll take that match up any day George said that and prie said that and Shanahan said that and everybody would say that I think uh and it was it was it a really impressive throw from pry because he had to hang in there he knew he was going to take a hit it was going to take a little time for that play to develop but he put it out there and then George KD um I've never seen him run a slower 10 15 yards than he did I mean he was milking that bad he was he was and he said he'll probably get in trouble for that so he probably won't do it again but who's going to get in do you think he'll get in trouble with Kyle or his dad do you think his dad would like uh no I think Kyle yeah okay yeah yeah which is you know to the point of what we were saying Kyle really can't be doing much criticizing for how people handle situations on the field in this game seems that he was out there and he was part of the Reas I'm sure he'll give him you know they'll watch film on you know Monday or Tuesday and he'll be he'll give him a little you know he'll joke with him I think tease him a little bit about not running all the way but at least he didn't drop the ball no on the way in no he did not do that okay so then that made it 20 to3 what was that was the college game what was that uh Washington yes Washington player dropped the ball like at the one yard line yes and you know my thoughts the broadcaster thoughts all went back to deshun Jackson yeah that was a few years ago mhm you're dating yourself Jennifer maybe oh okay so that 23-3 or 20-3 goes to 27-3 with k with Debo Samuels 23 yard touchdown run and like we said I mean dbo Samuel um you know the day for him 29 yards rushing and a touchdown and 30 yards receiving but his impact goes so far beyond the numbers it really does I mean just him being out there if he and Christian mcaffe are out there both of them can carry the ball as a running back both of them can catch the ball as a receiver so the what it does to the defense you can see them they don't know what who they're going to cover and how and then it's all about matchups then you get George KD against a linebacker or maybe you get somebody else you know more open but it's got to be so hard for an opposing defense to try and plan against the 49ers when both of those guys are on the field you know what uh we talked about Brock pie had his issues like in the fourth quarter m some of these games you know he'd been playing very well through three quarters he found the remedy just don't play in the fourth quarter that's that's that that's the new key I think yeah so they need to be ahead enough just build up build up a 34-point lead although he I think he threw one pass in the fourth quarter of this game it was that 22 yard touchdown pass to Kyle yek but that's the key just build up a 31-point lead and then you don't even have to throw the ball in the fourth quarter um I did talked to some of the guys in the locker room about were they happy they were very happy Javon uh Hargrave Javon Hargrave was like yeah there were some sad times so it feels much better you know they had to sit on those three losses through the bye and I think while that was sad for them and challenging I think it did light a fire underneath them it had to be humbling too because the whole world were were was telling them how great they were and then they lose in Cleveland then they lose in Minnesota and then the whole world is telling them how bad they are yeah yeah yeah um but they did talk about uh how Steve wils on the sideline was for them and I think that a lot of players he said before the game last week you know before they actually had the game that it didn't really mean too much to him he doesn't interact too much with Ste you know whoever the defensive coordinator is um on whether they're on the field or not Jon hard grave said he doesn't really interact with the defensive coordin he's more interactive with Chris cerak he's more interactive when he was with the eagles with his defensive line coach not the coordinator but he did say it was nice to have him down there good to feel his energy and then I spoke to taleno huanga who also said it was great I asked him if he took advantage of Steve wils being on the sideline and he said yes he did they talked to him a little bit but also again feeling the energy when they were coming off the sideline it was just kind of it's kind of that inner uh immediate gratification of getting to talk to him um but like a lot of players have said to me once they do the Good Deeds or they have the good plays on the field that gives the coach energy and then it just kind of snowballs so it is like they feed off each other so it's not necessarily one or the other but the fact they're all together on the field I think is a good thing I you know I I'm going to kind of tie this offense and defense together because I think you know a guy like Deo Samuel he saw this team lose three games in a row um and you know I think he took it upon himself to you know obviously he was he was injured but he was back healthy this week I think he put something on himself to help this losing streak come to an end clearly Trent Williams the same way where he might not be ready to play 100% or anywhere close to it but he couldn't just stand idly by anymore and watch his team lose he felt like he had to do something about it and I think what Steve wils moving from the booth to the sideline is is that it puts more on the defensive players you know it puts more on Bosa Armstead and I'm thinking about the guys who know the defense very well and who will speak up and have you know are smart guys who really know the defense Fred Warner um Tashan Gibson probably taleno hanga now in his third year with the organization second year as a starter um you know the guy the the cornerbacks whatever I think if there's ever something that's not going right with the defense like now those guys can like get it done immediately you know they can go to the defensive coordinator and say hey look from my vantage point this is what the offense is doing how about if we try this so I think it kind of creates that kind of ownership or accountability right and it's it's obviously instantaneous communication as opposed to putting on the headset or calling on the phone but it can be also little things I I I'm not saying that this happens but I can see how maybe a player sees something little but doesn't think think it's a big enough deal to call upstairs so now with him right there hey I think I kind of see this instead of like would you get on the headset to go say I think I kind of see this but I'm not sure now with him on the field hey I kind of see this are you seeing this too and then they can make a decision on whether that's happening and then move forward from there you through the first eight games now we're officially second half of the season the 49 hours you know everybody will agree they have a very talented roster some really good players on both sides of the ball all levels when they were five and three I don't think you could have said that any one player is like having a career year you know maybe Brock pie because his career has just been so Shor but I I don't think that there's any player on the team you know even like Christian mcaffrey where you know he had that big fumble against the the Minnesota Vikings in that game I don't think there was any player where you could go wow this guy's playing exactly how everyone expected him to at a very high level he's having a career type of year right something that where it's as close to perfect as possible yeah I mean perfect is you know tough obviously if not impossible but you know like you Nick Bosa for last year NFL defensive player of the year uh you know whatever Fred Warner through the the Cowboys game was starting to get a little defense of the Year player buzz but based on the last three games I I just don't think maybe Mitch wishnowski he might have been the closest guy as far as just really doing exactly what the team had hoped him to do right I mean I let's go with my mcaffrey right but like I said he did have that one critical fumble now in the second half of the season if guys are playing like they did against the Jaguars where you know Bose is getting one and a half sacks and getting a force humble you know Amry Thomas is making a play hardgrave is playing like he did um you know KD Samuel mcaffrey pie I mean all these guys that's why I think there's so much optimism with the 49ers is because all these guys know individually and as a group they haven't played their best football consistently and that's the goal now that's the expectation as they head into the final half of the regular season right the fact that they have not reached their full potential yet is kind of mind-blowing because obviously they've had so many games where they've scored 30 or more points against opponents but there's been a little blips little issues here and there for them to put together an entirely you know complete Game consistently that would be really impressive for them they've the easier said than done easier said than done but they showed that yeah I think they're still the team that that everybody kind of thought they were that they think they are and now they showed it in Jacksonville that's for sure they definitely showed it in Jacksonville now the key is to keep this thing rolling for them to secure that playoff bid which obviously with this victory in Jacksonville you know they're they're well on their way to the playoffs and the focus becomes obviously the NFC West and they still have two games of Seattle coming up a little bit down the road all right and when we return on 49ers talk I'll be joined by Carlos Ramirez he's the host of 49 pre and postgame live and he'll give us uh the perspective of what those guys

49ers pre and post game live ju Carlos Ramirez Carlos how are you not Juan Carlos Ramirez one Carlos Ramirez not to be confused with my distant cousin Juan Carlos Ramirez just in case oh o NE Carlos Ramirez that's who you are yes yes so yeah the um 49ers kind of look like the 49ers on Sunday isn't it amazing the difference a couple of weeks made the acquisition of an elite defensive pass rusher and the change of the energy in the room or the field for that matter when Steve wels came down from the booth to the field um I think if anything Matt this this went on Sunday proves several things to us I mean that was the vibe on the show here on postgame live one the credit that John Lynch deserves for putting up a roster and not being afraid to go out there and make moves and make trades and give their coaches ammunition to go out and have the best uh possible um both scheme and offensive weapons or defensive weapons to their coach's disposal and then B how a good collection of coaches puts their ego aside and works together in unison to make or do what's best for the benefit of the team and that's Steve wils going out of his comfort zone Matt and stepping down from the booth to coach from the sideline and we saw him you know uh fist bumping his players chest bumping his players after good plays and the energy mat and I want your take on this because you were there at at at Jacksonville us here from the bay we we thought the energy was different was that the case from your perspective yeah absolutely and I don't know how much of that was anything other than just coming back with fresh legs off the bye uh the 49ers were were kind of beaten down remember they made the trip to Cleveland they came back home they made the trip back to Minnesota and then they came back home and it's the first time in Kyle Shanahan's seven years as head coach where I've ever heard him talk about the energy level of the team you know were they flat against Denver or against the the Bengals maybe they were just slow they looked kind of be draggled in a lot of ways and so yeah I was going to ask you you because I'm at the game I'm not watching the TV so I don't see what TV is showing but did they show a lot of Steve wils on the sideline well I mean aside from the game itself it was I think it would go Taylor Swift is number one you know for on camera appearances on a football field and then it's Steve Wills number two because the camera would cut off cut off to him uh every time the defense made a good play every time the defense had you know a moment on the Ambry Thomas interception perhaps it was the most energetic we saw him chest bumping Ambry Thomas and the rest of the players uh you could see Nick Bosa and Chase young smiling after great plays after after they met at the quarterback and had each had half a sack uh the camera paned towards them and we saw them again it was a very different energy level Matt and I think it it went back not just to the early the beginning of the season but to previous seasons with when you saw Robert Salah fist bumping the air and Deo Ryan hugging his players I think the play this core of players is used to that sort of interaction Matt and they feed off of it yeah and I also think that you know these guys know that defense you know they've been around a while you know Jennifer and I were just talking about you know the accountability that it kind of puts on the players too where you know Steve wils isn't unseen you know he's on the sideline so now you know guys can go up to them and and chime in with any suggestions or just some input of like hey this is what they're doing you know what what do you think we should do or how about if we try this so I just I think it just opens up the the lines of communication more Let me let me ask you something I didn't I didn't make to cut you off let me ask you something because uh I was there Thursday you were there by there I mean Santa Clair not Jacksonville you were there the whole week and again today and the post game pressor kle Shanahan made a concerted effort to downplay the significance of Steve wils being down there to me that message is contradictory to what is actually happening because if it's not a big deal then why make the change in the first place if it's not a big deal he would have stayed up in the booth they wouldn't have talked about it and he wouldn't have come down from the booth I think it's a massive deal I think it is a big isue and the fact that we saw that today and I'm not I'm not saying they put up the defensive performance they put up on Sunday because of this whole fact that Steve WLS came down from the booth but if it's not a big deal then why make the change I think it's a big deal Matt I I I agree with you I definitely agree with you in the sense that if it's not a big deal right then why do the move what what it shows Carlos is that this team is searching for answers right and everybody could see things were not right well when things aren't right you know you can either just leave it alone and just have you know Blind Faith that it's going to come through and it's going to get better or you can make little little tweaks where you think hey this could help this is the way we've done it in the past it was successful this way but yeah I mean you're absolutely right if it wasn't a big deal put it this way if the 49ers were 8 and0 going into the bi-week nobody would be talking about you know Steve wils should he stay in the booth should he come downstairs or everybody be like oh leave him alone he's doing fine right but the fact that they lost three games and the defense simply could not make the adjustments and stop Kirk Cousins and Joe burrow then it it made Kyle Shanahan say hey we have to revisit this Steve why don't you come down the field and I just think it it changes the vibe and sometimes that's all you need is to change the vibe just the way Deo Samuel and Trent Williams changed the vibe on offense I mean those guys clearly had more of an impact in this game than Steve wils did but yeah it just looked it looked better it looked crisper the defense was flying around it just looked more like you associate the 49ers defense to be and and I don't know if if you think the same but I think in the first five games of the Season we all thought the offense is set in the trend and the defense is following whatever energy the offense is setting and I've always thought this team is not built that way this team and that's why they've allocated so many resources towards building that defensive line whether it's via draft or free agency I believe the beaten heart the beaten drum of the Rhythm that K Shanahan and his team plays comes from the defense and I thought even though they scored on the first drive again on Sunday that happened after they got the defense got a three and out and gave the ball to the offense again maybe this Sunday's game M will become the game that sets the trend for what the 49ers truly are and it's a defensive first football team that from that side of the football energizes the offense and allows the freedom to be who they truly are Matt I I think now the 49ers aren't necessarily a defense driven team or an offense driven team I do think that the offense has caught up to them I mean this is the first time as Jennifer pointed out first time since you know the uh the early 2000s that they have a Pro Bowl quarterback because that's what Brock p is he's a Pro Bowl quarterback and it's they've never had I mean rarely have had the kind of Playmakers skill guys that they've had on offense so they can win a shootout you know they can win a a 45 to you know 38 game or whatever they can also win a 1714 game so I don't think it has to be Reliant it doesn't have to be one or the other but as we saw on Sunday when they're they're clicking when the defense opens the game by getting a couple of three and outs and the offense is putting up points on every drive and they they did leave some points out there you know there the first couple turnovers the 49s generated they weren't able to cash those in but I I don't think it's I think they're more sophisticated now more complex than to say they're they're just a defensive team because I do think that offense has a chance I think put it this way I think the 49ers offense and the 49ers defense when they're clicking when they're rolling they're easily top five units in the league I agree with you my point is I think the energy of this team comes from the defense I think their offense is Stout is legit is perhaps one two or three in the NFL with I don't know the Eagles the Bengals in in terms of sheer Talent what I'm saying is the if the defense is not up is not bringing the energy and it's not there the offense by itself cannot win for football games yeah know because I know I mean it's a good conversation to have I I just think I think a guy like Debo Samuel brings energy and brings Pizzaz mcaffry the same way and you know Trent Williams has a you know orary side of him so I I don't I don't think the forers offense needs the defense but in order for the team to get where they hope to go then then you need both sides of the ball doing the kind of thing that they're what they did on Sunday in Jacksonville yeah yeah I I go just to this to switch gears the team on the three- game losing streak scored 17 points per game and no one said the offense has a problem everyone said the problem is the defense so why was everyone pointing to the defense when they they had a three game winning losing streak but they weren't putting up more than 20 points they were saying Brock's fine everything's fine granted Trent was out and Debo was out and that's the truth but everyone made a huge deal about hey the defense the defense what's happening with the defense and they got Chase young and Steve WS was s down to the field so again but I think it's a great debate uh Chase young Chase young Matt Chase young um Dante made the point and Rod as well on the postgame show they believe Chase young is to this defense what Christian mcaffrey was was last year to the offense in this regard that chase young unlocks everyone else on the defensive front and by rebound everyone else on the secondary level and the SEC or the linebacker level and the secondary level because they're interchangeable pieces we saw him go inside him and Bosa then we saw him go outside we saw him rush from the same side we saw a fiveman front which we haven't seen since the Giants game do you agree that chase young can have that same unlocking potential piece that mcaffrey had on the offense I I I don't know if it'll be that dramatic but I think you saw a different kind of Defense you know you saw you know the for I I don't know what they call this package you know NASCAR package or whatever but yeah you saw times when the 49ers on nickel DS had four defensive linemen and three of the four were Bosa Chase young and Randy Gregory and so that that's a different kind of look but it certainly appeared that way I I just I felt and I felt that pass rush was really coming on and looked good you know Bosa had his best game uh you know it was kind of funny early in the game second quarter when they they talked this week about meeting at the quarterback you know the old oh State the Buckeye connection all that stuff and I mean they got to the quarterback they got to Trevor Lawrence at almost the exact same time POA forces the fum so yeah no I I think that chase young does have that ability that's why the 49ers got him uh John Lynch wanted to make sure that people didn't think that this was just the magic pill and now all their problems are solved but it certainly looked that way that yeah I mean Chase young might not solve all the 49 problems or the problems that cropped up during that three- game losing streak but that addition is a huge addition for this defense uh I want to go back to the offense and I just thought about this I  think because of the position he plays I believe Brock p is the most valuable offensive piece for the 49ers he touches the football more than anyone right but if anything I think Sunday's game once again proved at least to me I want your take on this that after Brock to me it's Trent because they were missing Aaron Banks and no one felt the absence of of the dancing bear next to Trent and we saw the last three games how that offensive looks without 71 you know being that bodyguard and we I've never seen this before we saw it we we talked about it on postgame live Dante had never seen it before or rod and even I think Trent acknowledged it in the press conference we have never seen a secondary player on defense run away from an offensive tackle look looking to block him downfield running towards his end zone for sheer for his life so if if I tell you that Trent is number two on the valuable checklist for the 49ers offense would you agree it's it's hard to argue with you because you you also kind of look at it like you know where do these guys rank in just how well they do their job and not only like among current players but also just in the history of the game and it's very easy to make the argument that you know Trent Williams is at the absolute top of the list when it comes to left tackles in the NFL and as I believe was George KD mentioned that you know he's going to be a first ballot Hall of Famer and he's one of the best who's ever done it so yeah there was definitely all of that uh Trent Williams uh the forers offense looked whole again with dbo Samuel with Trent Williams with Brock pry taking care of the football and making some pinpoint passes on third downs and and in the red zone and the 49ers roll past the Jacksonville Jaguars 34-3 and they'll be back at it next week to see if they can start a winning streak coming off a losing streak they're going to

Welcome to your Houston. Rewind for October 30th through November 3rd. I'm K 211 digital anchor, Brandy Smith. We know catching up on the news can be overwhelming in a city like Houston where it just doesn't stop. So every weekend, we take this opportunity to fill you in on some of the stories you may have missed. Let's rewind Monday. A Houston judge set a trial date for Ken Paxton's long delayed felony securities fraud case. It will start on April 15th and the benet broke down why? This was a moment more than eight years in the making. Paxton was first indicted on these charges back in 2015. The legal battles over where the trial should happen stalled this case until the judge ruled Houston earlier this year. Now today, we know when Paxton will face a jury after walking away the winner last month in Austin, Ken Paxton is striving for a repeat next year. In Houston, the attorney general skipped most of September's two week long impeachment trial. But during a roughly 10 minute long hearing inside this courtroom, today, Paxton sat silently with other defendants on the docket as judge Andrea Bell said an April 15 th trial date. And unlike the impeachment, this is going to be a fair trial, a trial over different charges decided by a different jury, 12 men and women of Harris County, instead of 30 state senators, these senators were told up front that they will be pri if they mess with Ken Paxton, this jury will not be prima, they have nothing to fear. Paxton's lawyers also believe they'll get a fair trial. We have a fair judge and I think we expect even handling this. Their client maintains his innocence while maintaining some of the lawyers from his impeachment win. They're battling special prosecutors who say Paxton recruited investors for a Dallas area tech company in 2011 without telling them that company was paying him to do so. This is about the money for the special prosecutors. It's not about justice. The one lingering issue. Both sides left court without resolving today. How much the special prosecutors will get paid? Judge Bell will rule on the pay issue separately. There is a pre trial hearing set for February. If Paxton is convicted on some of these charges, he faces up to 99 years in prison. Reporting from downtown Houston, Adam Bennett, a security guard accused of posing as an officer then kidnapping and sexually assaulting a man faced a judge on Monday, Michelle Choi heard about the disturbing allegations from prosecutors. Prosecutors say the victim had just gotten off work made a quick stop at a corner store here in the Spring Branch neighborhood and began walking home when he was stopped by a man pretending to be a police officer. That man, according to prosecutors is 28 year old Jianna Gillespie 11 was the only news crew to get video in court. This morning, Gillespie is charged with aggravated sexual assault, aggravated kidnapping and Impersonating a public servant. Today, his bond was lower from the initial 300,000 to $230,000. Instead, obviously, I did not want the court to reduce the bond, but I do think that the bond is remaining sufficiently high that will keep him in custody as well as keep the community safe. Prosecutors say on October 4 just after midnight, Gillespie pretended to be a police officer and flashed his emergency lights to flag down a 25 year old man walking down Westview. They say he told him he was a suspect in a crime, then detained him, put him in handcuffs and into the back of his vehicle allegedly called dispatch before taking him to another location where he sexually assaulted him, then brought him back. They say the victim told investigators he didn't fight back because he was scared for his life and believed Gillespie was a real police officer who had a gun on top of that intimate level of violation. You have a defendant who is posing as a police officer, someone that as a community we're supposed to trust and that we are trained and educated to trust and here he is abusing that position of power to take advantage of somebody and ultimately sexually assault them. Prosecutors say investigators tracked down Gillespie's vehicle thanks to surveillance video. According to his former employer, Texas Crime LLC, a private security company here in Houston, Gillespie used his personal vehicle for work. The company issued this statement saying Gillespie was already off the clock when the alleged assault happened and that he's since been fired. Meanwhile, prosecutors believe there could potentially be more victims out there. They say they will be working closely with HPD on this ongoing investigation. As for Gillespie, if he makes bond, part of his bond conditions include no firearms, no badges, no uniforms or anything that could make him look like an officer, parents and students at Houston I DS Eastwood Academy High School left a Monday night meeting more frustrated than ever. They've been trying to get answers after the principal and several other staff members were suddenly removed from campus last week. Even though the district turned and away. She found out what happened during the meeting, frustrated parents and students demanding answers tonight after their principal and several staff members were removed just days ago at Eastwood Academy. At tonight's meeting, a district representative told parents those school leaders and employees were removed due to an investigation and some you care for my child because if you care for our Children. You would have been transparent and let us know. But they again failed to offer specifics. Parents and students say the problem is those employees haven't been replaced and they assured us that all these positions would be filled. She had a substitute teacher today and they did nothing in class and for seniors, their biggest concern, college applications are due November. That's two days from now and they don't have a counselor. We need qualified people at our school to help us. And right now they're not providing that for us. We want the next steps. We wanted a plan and students and parents say they got nothing from the district and were shut down when they demanded answers. They said this meeting left them right where they started frustrated with even more questions. What we got was the same non answers and no elaboration and just nothing. They're lying to us. Honestly, they're telling us they're gonna give us all these resources that they know they don't have that. They know they're not gonna give us coming here and getting no answers, the dismissive and disrespectful attitudes trying to shut down our voices. Houston police say they are not investigating any incidents at Eastwood Academy and referred us back to Houston ISD Police. The chief of that agency didn't respond to our request for comment even though the temperatures crept back up as the week ended. It started with Chris cool mornings Monday, Stephanie Whitfield visited Memorial Park where people didn't let the rain or the cold slow them down. What a difference a day makes. If you ask me, this is perfect weather to stay inside with a hot cup of coffee. But we didn't get that assignment.

The FBI director issued a warning Tuesday after a Jordanian citizen living in Houston was arrested on gun charges. That man is accused of looking into how to make bombs and supporting the killing of Jews Matt doty learned what put the suspect on the FB I's radar in the first place 20 year old. So A Y is in federal custody tonight. Federal law prohibits most immigrants seeking asylum from possessing or firing a weapon, but that's exactly what prosecutors say he did and a new court documents, that's not all they're alleging the feds say Abu Yash was in contact with others who share a radical mindset and also viewed specific and detailed content posted by radical organizations that content included lessons on how to make bombs or explosive devices. Prosecutors say he also made statements to others that supported the killing of people of certain religious faiths. They also say he had conversations about violence and being a martyr in support of a religious cause. Concern is that violent extremists, individuals or small groups will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East. The FBI director referencing Abu Yash during a hearing on Capitol Hill as he warned, the terror threat in the United States has reached the highest level in years. Today, we visited two Houston area gun ranges where prosecutors say Abu Yash trained the first Saddle River Spring gun range in spring. The other in Northwest Harris County at range USA at either location would speak on camera. But according to court documents, they've cooperated with federal law enforcement not far from range USA. We found the Northwest Harris County home where Abu Yash lived and although there were people inside, they would not answer the door. Neighbors told us they had not heard anything about his arrest or the alleged extremist threat living right next door. Abu Yash is currently being held in federal custody. A federal magistrate deemed him too great a threat to be released on bond a month after returning to work after being treated for depression. Harris County judge Le the dog go talk to Marcelino Benito about several topics including how she's feeling. Now, the county judge told me she's quote, feeling great. It's been a pretty busy, fast paced month for her dog. A lot of issues on her plate and she's keeping a very close eye on a looming election that will determine who will next lead the city of Houston. I'm doing great. I really am. You know, they told I was, I was good to go judge Lina Hidalgo back on the job. And in the middle of all the action at Commissioner's court Friday will mark one month since she returned to work. She stepped away over the summer to seek treatment for clinical depression out of state in Ohio. Initially, I was supposed to be at the mental health facility for five weeks and then the care team extended it to seven weeks. So by the time I was ready to be discharged, the sense was I'm good now I felt a lot better, but Hidalgo admits returning to work brought with it its own concerns. Of course, in the back of my head, I was a little bit worried, you know, what if it comes back? How do I know I'm actually better and now, you know, a month into the job around six weeks after discharge, I really feel great. She says improving her mental health and focusing on getting better. Now, has her seeing the job differently. I'm enjoying every so much more than I ever did before. Just experiencing things from a different perspective. An issue top of mind for Hidalgo as of late problems at the Harris County jail after an inmate died last week awaiting trial, the 15th jail death this year, I want us to be discussing this every court because in my mind, it is an emergency. County officials also now in the middle of running an important election, Houston's mayor on the ballot. It's a race. Hidalgo and county leaders are closely watching. There's a new kid, there's a new kid in school, right? That's going to come in and I'm gonna have to make friends with them. And so whoever wins, I'm going to work with, but of course, I have a preferred candidate, the county judge encouraging all voters to get out and vote no matter who they're voting for and to take advantage of early voting options that wrap up this Friday.

And y explained how it all went down. The construction of a new home can be a job opportunity for construction workers. But lately work has been risky. Houston construction worker who wanted to remain anonymous told me he's been robbed numerous times and he's not alone. Just two days ago. Other workers were robbed at gunpoint at the same construction site. The crooks struck at around two in the afternoon. According to Houston, police, three suspects held the workers at gunpoint stealing tools and equipment including a compressor and a generator. Court records show quick work from police led officers to the pawn shop less than three miles away. 23 year old Corey Clark was charged with aggravated robbery.

But in court, we also found out you have a total of four cases remaining before the court. Clark has a long list of pending charges. He allegedly put a towel around the complaint at the neck including assaulting a family member back at the construction site. These workers say they are happy an arrest was made but they have been robbed over and over and all of their hard work they say is taken from them in seconds. The construction company told an yelly. Its crews have been targeted by criminals since the day they started work. We are days away from the November election and Harris County election managers are optimistic. Things will run smoothly. Despite past issues Wednesday, they allowed us to watch a run through of election night. Jason Miles stepped us through how it'll work inside in our G arena where the Houston life and Rodeo is partly held. Election personnel prepare for their big event. We saw last minute poll worker training in one space by law. We have to offer a ballot in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese and a voting machine demonstration and another the so called election command center is where both electronic tallies and required paper backups end up. I feel really confident and good about election day. A firestorm following last year's election returned election duties to Harris county clerk Tanisha Hud's office. We have put many measures in place in a small amount of time as you all know, I inherit the operation September 1st. And so we have been moving very fast. These cameras monitor the command 24 7 and are available for public view on the Harris votes website. And for the first time in several years, our ballot box materials from hundreds of polling places will first stop at one of six rallying sites to help consolidate trips to the command center where officials are also preparing for potential sickness or other election worker absences. And so what we do is go to an emergency management system of individuals who are ready to go to the polls. Those are places where many workers have used early voting to work out. Any kinks seems like it's a lot more streamlined process now. So hopefully, things have changed. They've learned their lessons and we can go from there if you're looking for more information about the November 7th election, just text the word vote to 713526, 1111.

Marcelino Benito stopped by champ burger on the east side to show us how one neighborhood is breathing beauty into loss. Guys, culturally, death is typically something somber, but on the other Los Muertos, it's really quite the opposite. It's a celebration of life and love. And it's all centered around a friend or altars and shrines just like this burger has been a staple on the East Side, serving up burgers and fries since 1963. But six years ago, it's inspired by my wife who is from Mexico, a personal Dia de Los Muertos ofa or shrine to the founder of this is my father up at the top. Mike Saladino who was the champ gave rise to a new neighborhood tradition. Little by little. It has developed into a neighborhood community, community altar. The one small Ofrenda for Chris Saladin's family has grown into a large shrine for the entire community to drop off photos to remember their deceased loved ones. We had several yesterday, a couple today have been by people come by to take pictures to make sure that the photos of their family members that they have put up over past years are still up. Many, many of the photos that are on here are past customers, customers that have passed away over the years among the lives remembered H CSO deputy Darren Almendares tragically gunned down last year. His wife leaving this photo at the altar. He was a constant customer of champ. I love former employees on too. This young lady worked at champ burger for over 20 years. She was killed in a car accident. The bright colorful displays feature more than photos but mids flowers believed to attract spirits, small sugar skulls and Mementos that meant something to the dead. Every once in a while, somebody put up a can of beer or a little glass tequila chips cookies, you know, candy, just anything that would, would make the their family member happy in the afterlife. They are elaborate decorations on a one of a kind holiday believed to reunite the living and the dead. It is a celebration of life gives people a chance to remember their family members in a bright light and the Los Muertos is actually a two night celebration. So it continues tomorrow. And Chris tells me folks are welcome to stop by and drop off photos of their loved ones tonight or tomorrow. If you do so, your loved one will be included in the Ofrenda year after year. This week, what's called a music in Medicine concert was held at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The Texas Medical Center orchestra performed as part of a scientific experiment. During the performance, the electrical brain waves of the audience and musicians was monitored and measured. Sherman Chow, asked the pianist and neurosurgery professor who composed all this, what she hopes to accomplish. Doctor May re is both an associate professor of neurosurgery and a concert pianist. Well, how old were you when you started playing? I was three years old. I was trying to, I've performed in public over 600 times. Those two loves prompted her to create the music and medicine program at MD Anderson she designed a new study to track the brain's electrical currents about the musician and audience members in a concert. There'll be about a dozen similar performances to see if the brains are synced in the reactions to the music. Ultimately, the question is if music can be prescribed for a surgeon and patient during an operation and afterwards, for better results, what kind of music matters? Bad for surgery? Bad, very bad. What seems to work best, more neutral classical music which echoes human physiology, music that align with the human resting heart rate within 60 to 80 beats per minute. When the frequency aligns with the low range of a mother's soothing voice. Think of a cello, consider patients who have had brain tumors removed or chemo brain. Even COVID patients experience foggy brain music has been shown to promote oxygenated blood flow to targeted regions in the brain that helps reduce inflammation and potential eases symptoms.

MD Anderson's chief of neurosurgery explains different areas of the brain control different parts of the body. Music has profound effects on our brain that we don't fully appreciate through those effects. You can actually influence all functions of the brain. So your gut, your heart rate, immune system, potentially one day certain kinds of music might improve your digestion, heart and overall health.

Almost a week after a massive mulch fire in Spring branch started burning. Neighbors found out it could burn for weeks and they're concerned about all the smoke and ash in the air that Doherty attended a town hall meeting about the fire Thursday night. Logs as large as 50 inches in diameter still burn at this development site in Spring Branch where neighbors say piles of trees and had been stacked up to 40 ft high for more than a year after the land was cleared, you tend to find that the issues increased during the evening so that when you find that you're getting the tickle in your, the room was full at a town hall meeting tonight. As neighbors asked their most obvious question, when will the fire be extinguished? The extinguishing effort? And what they're having to do is they, they're pulling material out. They're turning it over, they're wetting it down and then they're carrying it away. The fire was first noticed on Saturday grew over the weekend and into the start of the work week by Halloween. The Houston Health Department says air quality reading showed particles in the air were greater than average. However, they won't say if the air is or was healthy for the public to breathe. They say that could vary from person to person. I want to stress the fact that this is there is no fire spread beyond what already here. Neighbors tonight also looked for someone to blame. The Houston Fire Department won't say if investigators have found anything that would indicate what started the fire saying it's still under investigation. The city council member, Amy Peck said no permits were issued for a planned burn on the site. Neighbors also questioned how authorities could have possibly allowed for these giant piles of debris to grow so high for more than a year without recognizing there a fire danger. The city asks any neighbors with health problems related to the smoke to call 311, the biggest jail in the biggest county in Texas needs help. We've told you about the staffing crisis at the Harris County jail before but the sheriff's office dropped numbers Thursday revealing the jails larger than some small Texas towns. De Ro spoke to deputies who say they need help fast as the largest county in Texas continues to grow. This is just natural with an increase in population. So does the demand for the Harris County Sheriff's Office? According to Lieutenant Mike Wynn, we're looking at over 10,000 inmates in the Harris County jail and that means greater need for the detention officers who work behind the scenes in the Harris County jail system, their role watch over the inmates care for the inmates. We are responsible for the care and custody of the inmates. The department has roughly 1900 of these officers but need an additional 500 more. What's the risk with these sort of vacancies in our jails right now is the safety of the inmates safety of the jail personnel. And this is, this is not just strictly with us, but we're looking at a nationwide issue with staffing, which is why the sheriff's office is recruiting through an upcoming open house and raising pay for these officers. Commissioners court just recently approved a 12% raise. We're looking at 2239 an hour and the ones that work overtime, they're looking at making 62 $63,000 a year minimum. Some are making a lot more than that with opportunity for growth. The county hopes it can attract reinforcements. This is a good time to go out there, speak to a detention officer, get to know what their job duties are, get to see what they deal with on a regular basis and this may be a career for you. The sheriff's office is holding that open house next weekend for more information about the events and what it takes to become a corrections deputy. Look for this article on khou dot com. If you have a problem, Grace can help and let me tell you, Judy Pris had a problem. The Houston mom opened up the box of her wedding dress and found out that the dress in the box, it wasn't hers. She turned to grace White to find her wedding dress. They said this is you 1995. Yes. I always have to think like was it really that long way for Judy Prisk planning her daughter's wedding was a chance to walk down memory lane. It's been a lot of fun. And when her daughter Audrey wanted to recreate her dress, could it probably right at the knee and take the sleeves off and make it more of like a cocktail dress. Judy pulled down her box from the attic and then it had the plastic on it. So I'm like, ok, this still looks great. But when she opened the lid, so you open it up and I'm like, not your dress. I did not have any beans on that dress. That's when they realized Judy's dress must have been swapped with another bride. How much would it mean to you to have your dress back? So, my dad died when I was 23. Um, but my brother took us to dinner and gave me an envelope and then it was $1000 check and he goes, dad's not here. I want to buy your wedding dress. And Judy saved all her receipts. They showed her picking up the dress from Gorman's Cleaners on the Katy freeway on December 22nd 2000. The cleaners was well known in Houston opening its doors in 1948. It's now closed. But when we stopped by, there was a sign on the door with a number. I was trying to reach Gorman's cleaners about a wedding dress. Gorman's linen service answered. It's a few doors down and still shares the same name. But a manager called us back to say they wish they could help but they don't have any of the cleaners records. I was going to wear my mom's wedding dress for my reception dress for my something borrowed. Meantime, this bride to be took to tiktok to share her mother's story. Hoping that by her wedding date, February 17th, they will find the dress and get this one back to its rightful owner. Somebody else has this beautiful dress that meant the world to them. And that's it too. I just wanna give this back even if I never find mine. Wouldn't that be cool if I could give that dress back to someone, if you recognize the dress or if you need Grace's help, you can reach out in all of the different ways you see on your screen right now. A Houston staple just celebrated 20 years in business, but it is still very much a hidden gem. Here's a look inside Red Lion, British Pub. You Little Boogers. Craig Mallinson would rather be anywhere other than in front of my camera. But a few days before Halloween, he braved the hot seat, literally feet from the fireplace for a reason. I'm very, very fortunate. I'm gonna keep saying that you might wanna edit this because I'm just gonna keep saying I'm very, very fortunate. Fortunate for the regulars who've kept his Red Lion British pub along Shepherd Drive open for 20 years and the staff who've been there almost that entire time between Rachel and Juan could not do this place. Server Rachel Goodman started working at the pub 18 years ago. I just might like it. It's like a job, but it is very sociable as far as jobs go. Do you know what I mean? Juan Ascencio, the executive chef came on board just a few years later. The number one rule here, it's when you're doing things, make sure you're doing right. And I always encourage that to my land cooks crafted by Juan and Craig. The menu features Indian and Mexican flavors as well as the standard pub fare like Shepherd's pie and fish and chips is a well known that's, you can't miss that one. It's, it's very popular, so popular. The staff here fries up about \u00a3200 of it every week. The fish and chips is like our, you know, that's probably what we're most famous for food wise. At least the pub is also known for its iconic phone booth imported from England, the hardwood tables, chairs and bar, the leather wrapped booths and the gold plaques adorning. Well, just about everything I started doing it when I first opened the door. I thought it'd be nice to have people's identity here and then they feel part of something. Yeah, it's just my way of saying to people. Thanks for coming here. We appreciate you. And now you're a part of the pub talking to staff here and regulars. One of the comparisons that came up over and over again was that the Red Lion is kind of like Houston's own cheers. Houston. You just, it is the biggest, small town in America, right?

If you want to improve your state or your country, sometimes the opportunity is hidden in plain sight. It's a very nice place to come for early voting and it's the location, convenience and issues like crime and taxes compelled Monica Brown Ao and her husband Michael to vote at this unique polling place. It's hugely important. I mean, there are so many people around the world that don't get a chance to vote and don't get the chance to make their voice heard and feel completely impotent. Raindrop. Turkish House in Southwest Houston is one of 68 diverse early voting sites offered by Harris County. It's registered voters can use any of them and check wait times at Harris votes dot com.

If you sit at home and don't do anything, then you're gonna be ignored are putting the same message out in the open Rice University in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. A party called the Night of Decadence it did with several people in the hospital. Jason Miles shared the university's response not typically considered a party school. The annual night of Decadence underwear party last weekend has resulted in major changes here at rice. Everyone knows the amped up and everyone knows to take care of each other at rice. Whenever we have these kind of recent grad, Ashley Dwang was surprised to hear things got so out of hand. I don't want people to think we're just like all these nerds at rice. It's that we do have fun but we want to have fun responsibly. And I think this kind of incident doesn't really reflect rice as a result of hospitalizations and even arrests. Last weekend, the university just announced the cancellation of all campus wide public parties. Spring break and so called pub nights will be limited to those over 21. The night of Decadence held since 1972 is on probation. While the review takes place in a statement, a spokesperson added a committee will also convene to review the university's alcohol policy. Students in violation could face increased sanctions as rice revisits the rules. I think that it is better than doing nothing because I think if nothing was done, it would only escalate. I don't know about canceling it through spring break. I would say maybe until the end of the semester would be a bit more appropriate. Most students and alumni I randomly polled agreed that fun parties are one thing but potentially dangerous ones have no place at Rice. A juvenile justice facility in Harris County underwent a makeover turning into what's being called the Opportunity Center. Michelle Choi went to the ribbon cutting to learn more about the building's new purpose. After closing its doors in 2019, the county and its community partners stepped up to turn this former detention center into a school and a community outreach center and just like the name. It's opening up opportunities for a lot of people. You got A S has always marched to the beat of his own drum. It sounds, it sounds better than the music right now. I ain't got no music playing when he isn't creating music. You'll find him and his other favorite class. This is our auto shop class. This is my tool box. This is where I make all the magic happen with. This 17 year old has learned a lot about tuning cars and life since attending the Opportunity Center. It's a great place for everybody to welcome you with open arms. Life hasn't been the smoothest ride. I have got intoxicated one night broke into a house that wasn't mine and I got arrested the following morning after that, my mind went spiraling down fast. Forward a year later. Thanks to a probation officer recommending him to the center. Alfonso's turned a corner last year. I was stuck in a hole where I couldn't get myself out of. Now. I got out that hole, dug the hole back up and I'm walking on his dream now to open his own mechanic shop, just like his favorite instructor who also went through the system in his teens. I feel good to connect with them and let them know that I've been in a situation that they have during the day. The opportunity center helps students who have or are currently on probation. Get ready for the GED as well as teach them a trade and connect them with potential jobs at night to open for the surrounding community to also advantage of any of the resources we have here, whether it be a basic need or a vocational training available to them as well.

and be kind that's terrific but the spirit of Mr Rogers um was always very kind and they're trying to get everyone to wear Cardigans I don't look good in a cardigan so I've seen you were a lot of Cardigans you like Cardigans I thought you know the funny thing is wasn't M wasn't he was in our sexual harassment training uh Mr Rogers he was yeah like the guy kept talking to the Mr Rogers portrait on his desk oh okay that yeah okay yeah it was interesting we have to take sexual harassment training there are long videos and they try to make them entertaining which I'm not sure if that's a good idea we should just learn the material everybody in Connecticut apparently takes that training oh yeah so he he talks to Mr Rogers on the in one of the video clips anyway so how are you how was your weekend uh the weekend was good and I want to hear all about whatever you can tell of yours because you went was a big moment you went to go see Paul get married I did it was it was an emotional weekend I didn't think I was going to be that emotional but it was I don't think that makes sense when you see someone who was like you're you get so so emotional baby every time I think of you so yeah I mean watched Paul get married yeah it was uh on 11-11 on 11-11 it was a beautiful venue it was um the New York historic I'm forgive me I'm going to get it wrong it was two Columbus Circle so if you're familiar with it and it was like up on the ninth floor Cara you had views of all the different avenues like it looked out onto the city oh that's cool it was really it was it was a stunning event and they were very happy and uh the wedding went off with that a hitch and they had a really good time yeah so it was good all right all right um well I want to thank everyone who came out so there was about a thousand people who came out to the Connecticut Children's um Gala Connecticut Children's Medical yeah well we have to call we have to call it Connecticut children children I was supposed to go to that um and and it's just incredible I mean they had the they had some of the cast from Encanto there and it was all decorated was beautiful but more than that a thousand people came coly was there wonderful and a lot of people made EXA you know even though this is a busy time especially for someone like curlyy uh but it was so how can you say no to kids and what they're doing is incredible there's only seven centers in the country that can do surgery while a baby's still in the womb I and this is one of them so we were raising money to further that and they profiled a couple who literally had come 3,000 miles to save their baby's life that is incredible so God bless it was incredible and and you know all of us who have healthy children were so blessed so I was really happy to be there absolutely that's great yeah I got invited to that but I couldn't go because the Paul's wedding yeah well that makes sense yeah it was it was good I'm glad you went I'm glad you it was really good and then um uh yeah was we did a turkey drive on Sunday so that was fun and I met a really cute miniature docin in Bushnell Park and I wanted it oh stop it and I held it and it was it

she's on clearance oh is she I didn't know that I thought about it anyway uh Sam's Club has an advent calendar where every day you get to open a piece of jewelry this is exciting it's but what if you don't like what you open well then you're cuz it's not like 25 bucks no it's 1900 and then the bigger one is like 3,400 yeah so you open it and there's a piece of jewelry every day not like jewelry right yes and I guess it must be actually real jewelry cuz 1933 is you know a thous almost $2,000 so oh okay you get to see all the pieces okay oh you do get to see all the pie here some of them ni all right so there's like total surprises 14 karat gold the Advent calendar comes in two versions a 12-day calendar for $1,933 and a 25-day calendar for $3800 so you're going to get some pretty good jewelry here but you got to be a member of Sam's Club in order to get it mhm and what is better than the combination of chocolate and peanut or maybe chocolate and coconut I do like that too yeah but don't add caramel yeah I I don't know why this is not this isn't exciting to me they're adding they're they're they're just ruining a perfect thing yeah exactly why do you but apparently there was a petition they discontinu this and the people brought it back change.org this is the time that people have in their lives they made a petition to add caramel to the big Reese's cup which is simply incredible you could find them in stores starting next Friday okay a lot of people like caramel now this caught my and I thought of you when I heard this story I would never do this I I I was

sell of course it's going to sell $115 baby moisturizer cleansers for 95 bucks a pop okay let's be clear and a 1970s perfume line for infants let's be clear your baby doesn't need perfume and doesn't need scented water in fact anything unscented is way better so I don't know I have a problem with that whole story that why I I I don't know why I don't I walked we we Rene their babies already smell amazing Renee needed Flats cuz the heels she wore to the Friday night party were not comfortable we went into one of the department stores in New York City they had a flat Cara it was it couldn't have

{"doc_id": "0pdnFCQx", "video_title": "Mark Harmon's new book 'Ghosts of Honolulu' written with retired NCIS agent is out now", "video_description": "NCIS exec. producer Mark Harmon has written a new book called 'Ghosts of Honolulu' and teamed up with a real life, retired, ...", "video_transcript": "War clouds with Japan are gathering and the islands of Hawaii have become Battlegrounds of spies intelligence agents and military officials with the Island's residents caught in between two Japanese men are at the center of a world changing cat and mouse game played between Japanese and US military intelligence agents at the outset of World War II the hit CBS drama series ncia is the most watched Prime Time show on the network but did you know that a retired NCIS special agent is also the technical adviser he produced a book along with one of the stars of the long running CBS show we have retired NCIS special agent Leon Carol Jr and NCIS executive producer Mark Harmon welcome and a great day Washington gentlemen thanks for being here morning morning and thank you now I know the two of you have had a relationship for almost two decades now working together so what was it Mark about this story that brought you together to write this book you know it's really the beginning this is uh about investigating NCIS as an actor and trying to figure out what the agency was at the beginning there was not much information about it I met Leon at the very beginning of starting to shoot the show and uh he's the real guy so as an actor you're trying to grab anything you can from the real guys and and that's where the initial part of this book idea started yeah well we've got the book right here it's a phenomenal book and for anybody who is looking to read this book can you tell us just a little bit more about it is that directed to me or yes sir I'll take it well really what we wanted our audience to see is something different about the NCIS and I think what they'll find is it's not a murder a week this is about the origins of the organization which is are rooted in Counter Intelligence and counter Espionage mark would it be fair to say like the show NCIS obviously brought NCIS to our attention of what the organization does what the teams do but this is just like Leon just said kind of giving us that start like how did this all come to be because it wasn't always NCIS no not at all uh it was actually o and I Office of Naval intelligence and this developed from that and Douglas W who we talk about in this book and who we introduce is really the first of of what became NIS and then NCIS but but the television show has helped all of that along the agency was around for a long time before that and people were doing very quiet specialty work for a long time and Douglas W was an individual with a very specific skill set at the right time in the right place and and this story is about him and Le Leon tell us a little bit more about the collaboration what was that process like it was a really complex uh situation because we were taking research that had been gathered through our NCIS history NCIS Association history organization uh two agents by the name of Matt Parsons and Vic mcferson who are one is in New York here and one is in DC hopefully watching our show or your show and they had put together this whole research on NCIS as an agency going back to 1882 and so what we when we took this and looked at it we said this is what we want to do focus on this individual Doug W who was the first Japanese American special agent and take him through his career during World War II and Mark I want to ask you can you believe if you look back all these years the impact that the show has had on not just us but your life as well I mean it's still one of our most watched TV shows so long running now you're executive producer can you it's become like you become synonymous with NCIS Mark well look as an actor you you play a role and and you hope it goes on a while I don't know that you think it's going to go on for 19 years but uh in in the beginning um this show was based on real cases originally and then the television formula kind of affects it and you got to have a dead body every week otherwise a couple of actors don't work and so the formula changes and and obviously the formula has been successful but Leon Carroll was a a guy every day that I talk to I did never did an interrogation on that show ever as the character without talking to him and asking him what he might do or what he might think and and getting some of the real stuff from him along the way learning about this agency just offered respect to me and trying to tell some of the real stories and get those out there with this book I no no burning desire at all to be an author but but to work with him yeah that's uh that's important to me yeah I love this now you're bringing the real life stories to us gentlemen congratulations on an incredible collaboration so good to see both of you thank you thank you very much you very much absolutely have a great day you too be sure to check out ghost of Honolulu it's available now wherever books are sold",

to sign up right now but that's going to go up by $5 to 42 as of Saturday in the deadline to register Tuesday November 21st of course a lot of local businesses and companies come together to make that annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot happen every year including Eastern Connecticut health network joining me now once again the CEO of the network Deborah wayth good to see you again good to see you good morning yes good morning and this is becoming a tradition getting to talk to you it is about the tradition of ecn partnering with the Manchester Road Race how proud of you are uh how proud of uh ecn and all its employees are you oh I'm very proud of ecn and all of our employees um but do you know that this is the 20th year that we have been the presting sponsor for uh the uh this road race and it is just a wonderful event yeah and 20 years and not just like you said not just as a sponsor as a presenting sponsor too why is that so important I know I asked you this and I ask everybody who's a sponsorship you have so many places you could put your time your money and your attention why the road race couple of things um first it's about tradition and uh that wonderful small town uh home feeling of support and Care um and that's really what we're all about uh at echn we're about quality care taking care of families and the community and it's just a wonderful example of what we can do when we work together I know and you had mentioned community and I was saying I'm from South Windsor spend all my time in Manchester Vernon that area you see ech everywhere Manchester Memorial Hospital which by the way right down the road from the race route itself hopefully they don't get overwhelmed with people who overdo it trying to run on Thanksgiving but I imagine you'll be uh you'll be set if you do but it's not just the road race on that day itself talk to me about all the other sort of surrounding events with the road race that you guys are sure where there's the little road race um which takes place the Saturday before and then the ray kurs blood drive now this is a big event um and we can be a little competitive so uh if you're going to give blood this year this would be the event to go to yeah I forget it we're mentioning this beforehand right before we went on the air that we've had road race and blood drive officials in the past and you're right they are competitive they want to make sure they are the biggest blood drive in the state and uh making a lot all that happen it's not just writing a check right there's people from ecn what are they getting out there to do to help so I have to tell you this year we have a road race team of about 20 people who will be running they have been training and working uh with this group for some some time now they're pretty excited so they'll be representing ecn during the race itself all right how much training have they done do you know offand I say this because I am not a runner I had have no idea it would take me a year to try to try and do any training just to complete the 4.7 48 miles but uh that is great to see uh is it hard to get people to sign up for that sort thing or did you just find that no yeah actually to be honest the people that work at ecn are so community-minded and very involved and they care so deeply about not only their profession but our community so getting volunteers is usually not difficult yeah because not only are you serving a community you're doing it with people who live in the community right there and of course there's a lot of other efforts too we didn't

discuss Ives' tech predictions for next year, what the AWS events ...", "video_transcript": "his top picks are Apple Microsoft and Google joining us here at Post 9 today Dan IES web Bush Securities analyst Dan it's great to have you here uh sounds like you think it's going to be all about spending and use cases which are going to explode in the coming quarters I guess yes yeah that I mean to me it's all about use cases I mean we right now have about 80 use cases for AI based on all of our survey work 3 months ago that was 15 to 20 and I think that's what we're seeing even in earnings if you look at palente tier you look at Microsoft you look at data now it's the first second derivative and we believe the third and fourth are going to hit in 2024 which is what in my opinion the new tech bull market has begun uh is that going to begin to manifest itself and ignite in some of the AWS reinvent events yeah I I think it's going to be front and center I mean you saw with the Dela I think now you're seeing with jasse AWS Google querly Oracle going to be another one I think that's the key from an install based perspective you look at Adobe you look look at the like Oracle you look at sales force and of course right now at the top of the mountain is of course Microsoft but you look at what AWS is doing that's a huge monetization opportunity for them and I believe right now that's the Golden Goose that's what this is going after and we think it's a trillion dollars of spend over the next decade it's going to hit the shores of tech Enterprise tech only or consumer Tech too well I think I think Enterprise is 8 to 10x the opportunity right now of consumer Tech now when you look at consumer Tech I think that ultimately is the latter part where we're going to really see the Googles the metas the other from a consumer advertising perspective but s right now the use cases that we're seeing explode is an Enterprise what are you seeing that others are not seeing that have already seen the run up in these stocks so far this year and I've said they they've dominated and if the rally is going to expand we need to see more participation not just from the tech stocks sure and I think for us being in Asia two weeks I mean we saw it front and center in terms of not just use cases but but what the suppliers are talking about you look through the supply chain I think it all starts with chips and I think what we're really seeing is right now an underestimation of what the demand looks like from the chip sector and from software and I think when you look at names like Microsoft that first now is starting to see these use cases explode data dog I think paler is sort of The Golden Child of AI that is how it's all going to form and in terms of to Sarah's point the next wave is going to be broader Tech in terms of small small midcap and I think right now a lot of bears they're coming out of hibernation mode and I believe they go back in in terms of what I view is just a tech that ultimately could be up 8 to 10% more going into year end I'm trying to understand this use case thing though I mean all right we we co-pilots out there we can get a sense for that and then there's this idea that there are going to be a lot of other tools shared by the big players for smaller Enterprises but what are you talking about are you saying use cases from a lot of companies for their customers or are you talking about Microsoft providing all sorts of stuff into the Enterprise yeah it's use Cas I think nail on the head it's use cases that companies we're talking across verticals from Life Sciences pharmaceutical financials government where they're now seeing the use cases clear Roi now they're building it where are they building it on Microsoft on AWS on Google on gcp and that's why what we're starting to see right now in earning season is you're starting to see the next phase of that it's not just Nvidia now you're seeing Microsoft a dog py I ultimately believe Snowflake and I think many other sales force included and I think that's what we're going to be talking about you you've always talk about use cases what are the use cases we've done survey with what 670 Enterprises 80% of them said that they plan to aggressively spend on AI companies in 2024 we think it could be up to 8 to 10% of budgets from less than 1% today that is really so what's going on is it the learning curve is it everybody sort of getting comfortable and understanding again the use case or how it can help them I mean and how long does that take yeah I think what's really happened is that the last three to four months a lot of these companies cios they've kicked the tires they've done the trials they've done the beta periods now they look at and be like it's clear Roi if I spent one two million I could get that back in the course of 2 three months so I think the ROI is there it's board driven and now it's not just hype you're actually starting to see the use cases EXP good and that's why it all starts with starts with Nvidia then it goes to Microsoft and all the hyperscale players and that's why to me it's not just the call five seven players I think as we look out you're going to have 15 20 25 players across software and chips participating", "aigc_title": "New Tech Bull Market Begins with Focus on AI Use Cases, Predicts Wedbush

equity strategy, joins 'Squawk on the Street' to discuss Harvey's thoughts on equities ...", "video_transcript": "Christopher Harvey Wells Fargo Securities head of equity strategy is here at post n it's great to have you back Chris welcome good to be here we're basically at your target now right that's right you feel good sort of standing Pat for the next six weeks um pretty good we we still think a couple things you could go higher but if you go higher we don't want people to be greedy take some profits be a little bit more defensive in the short term we could see a sell the news around the shei Biden uh event because you have a lot of good news priced into that you have people looking forward to that and and that announced might disappoint but that's really a short-term issue why Uber caps because it has worked well it it has worked balance sheets are great better earnings they have the AI kicker and if you look at the economy is in an economic malaise and if you're looking at Value looking at smaller camps they just don't work in this kind of environment uh that's why the Russell was down almost every day last week right the the spread between small and large is is historic yeah so Russell has a really hard time Russell was almost in a bare Market when rates go higher the economy is not really working small caps risks they just have a difficult time getting out of their own way in this kind of environment it's really about growth it's about high quality growth and that's what's working and that's what we think will continue to work but one thing if you look at a lot of defensive sectors whether it's lowall whether it's Staples whether it's utilities they are now reaching oversold levels and that's something we're thinking about a lot more closely one thing you talked about last week was that the rate rise uh last couple years might have undone svb but you say it was not a clearing event that's right uh and that the 30-year auction implies that there's still some work to do or Consequences to be had there there's a lot of work to do if you look at duration duration is in really weak hands right what we've done is we miss price duration for a long period of time SV was an event not a clearing event a lot of those portfolios are still underwater a lot of the duration players don't have the risk to put on and if you can't do that right we could see rates back up pretty aggressively rates backed up they just floated up not for fundamental reasons but because people couldn't put on that risk and that hasn't gone away and the last thing we may see before year end we may see tax loss selling in bonds something we haven't seen for in years you said something earlier about the the shei Biden meeting you said that it might disappoint and I'm curious what what you think the Market's expectation is there because I thought it was pretty low expectations as far as what we expect to happen so if you look at the equity market and Equity Market R especially over the last couple days last couple weeks it's been pretty aggressive and I think people look at what's happened a lot of the tech um a lot of the bigger cap companies have rallied on that they're going to come out with something positive but I just don't think it's going to be positive enough and are the expectations low they might be low but the Market's not acting as if it's low we had a heck of a run over the last couple isn't that just about lower Bond yelds though Bond yelds haven't moved that that that low we're still at 460 460 something so Bond feels better it no no no doubt it feels better but we're coming from sub 4200 you can only account for a certain amount one of the things that I think is also happening is we went through earning season and we saw margins expand we saw Revenue go from contraction to growth something's happening on the fundamental side that we did not expect and I think the Market's appreciating that as well something Good's happening on the fundamental side I mean again right we had our first quarter over quarter year of eps growth since third quarter 22 that's right and and here's a funny thing the qualitative and the quantitative aren't matching if you look at you talk to seed all the time what are they saying they're saying hey the consumer's difficult the economy is difficult rates are higher lines and tigers and bears on know but you look at the qual the quantitative information and it's much much better and it's broad-based we thought that the margin expansion was only going to be a couple companies it's broad-based it's across sectors it's across stocks a lot of people are talking about productivity enhancements and that's a sticky that's something that stays around for a while", "aigc_title": "Wells

another round of sound on this live edition ...", "video_transcript": "all right welcome back we're talking about the Steelers Run game which again was fantastic today they carry the offense the offensive line has been terrific too bradick Jones looks like a natural at right tackle especially when they pull him put him into motion he and Sam Sam Alo have been outstanding but uh will I want to start with you on this one and that would be the division of labor at running back so far it seems like it's 5050 is that how it should be it looks like uh it's beneficial to both it's it's telling today that they introduced both of them as starters they you know maybe this was to punish George pickings for being a reality TV star or whatever might te wants to call it uh it's been gradually trending jaylen's direction for a while but I think this is it's kind of hard to complain when you got what 183 yards 206 what 216 total yards between them it's kind of hard to complain about the touches and especially the thing that's sort of refreshing unlike the wide receivers like they seem to be sort of happy for each other like they seem to be like okay raised eyebrow over there middle raised eyebrow I at least at least publicly we're around so I mean it's kind of hard to argue about the the productivity especially when the ego seem to have been checked at the door well if if Jaylen goes 110 and Naj goes 25 let's see how uh supportive he is of him but you know I've been on this bandwagon for a while now I like 6040 I like how they've been using these guys I still go 60% n 40% Jaylen depending on how they out come the game how it starts to go here I mean there the only difference between the two right now is jaylen's able to pop some bigger runs to make those numbers go up but if you go 64 is that what we've been clamoring for like years and years and now it's here I'm like wait a second he's not getting enough it's working great and as you said before sealo is struggle maybe early stud now rodri Jones is a stud makes everybody else better I mean they found something out that's the key you we talk about how you split the carries for these two guys the offensive line is the key here it's an absolute travesty that Rodrick Jones didn't start right out of the gate I mean you can see the difference in the Run game when they run to his side or when he gets out in front and pulls I mean it it's it looks like a classic Steelers Run game it's none of this Zone stretch crap to the sidelines that used to work with Le'Veon Bell where you'd pit or patter and then go this is no linemen get out they they create a hole and the running backs hit it it's why Jaylen Warren runs so well behind them because he is a hit the hole and go kind of guy and so whether it's 50/50 like it was today 6040 it can go 6040 either way for all I care to be honest if it's as productive as it was today because that offensive line blocks the way they did today I'm fine with it so you're saying it's not a wild cat oh by the way that Syracuse running back just ran for 10 more yards mean the tight end tight end my we're talking about something different how about that was just amaz we'll get into that a little bit later but I want to talk about the Steeler defense now too because give them a lot of credit man they are we talk about fourth quarter canny how about fourth quarter Steelers defense they don't give up any points they do give up yards and that still is something that has to be you know rectified and well today there were five of these passes over 35 yards and it didn't look good when it was happening they if that continues they're going to have problems shutting down games eventually it's it's fine to make big plays and they made two turnovers late in the game too that's helpful but is it just I'll use the same word sustainable to keep giving up all these yards no because eventually and we're going to see this in the next couple weeks they going to have play teams that are a little more capable offensively of hurting them and I think that's part of the they're doing good in the Red Zone they they're really they're not great in between the 20s but they do like they gave up the big run to Dylan and then they they kind of held him in check after that like the big play at the end of the game like you you shouldn't be getting 49 yards on one pass with a minute to go and no timeouts like that can't happen however it's like you know like people want us to kill this team because they look so unimpressive but my god when you look at the standings it's like what what can you do so I I they're going to be tested without B they're going to be tested without uh you know Hulk's out Alexander's out I mean that's going to be tough stopping the Run especially next week hopefully stefansky you know doesn't have the labotomy that he gets when he comes into this Stadium I would imagine they will run the ball more uh but the tests gets get tougher but they are the inside the inside linebacker thing is is a big issue that needs to be caught because those are the two better inside offall linebackers in coverage too hul and Alexander and now they're left with Roberts and Robinson and how many times have we seen a slot receiver you talk about the 2020 season Mark a couple minutes ago the 2020 wild card game still reverberates in my head Jarvis Landry running all over the hind field Turf because they kept trying to cover him with an inside linebacker Roberts and Robinson love them both in the Run game especially Al Landon Roberts he's a dog in the Run game these guys can't run all over the field and cover and so that's going to be a big ISS right a couple of plays over the middle to Musgrave one of them maybe move down in into that role that Mark Baron role where they got the hybrid linebacker the dime linebacker type of situation but we're missing something huge here that guy who's an all proo number 39 makes a big difference when he's not in there and and you think about that at times they had Tristan Thompson is that who that Trenton Tristan whatever he hits from long range he's got a greatpoint shot he does Tristan thompon and uh you know that's a little bit I mean Joey Porter's playing well Patrick Peterson playing well but there's and another thing is Cam Hayward is probably not anywhere near 100% right now he just doesn't look like he has that that's expected so you get some of these guys back I know you're not getting the inside guys back I know Graves wants to bring back Marcus Al be inside linebacker that's an adamsky thing that's an adamsky thing well bottom line is they got to figure out what to do there and I wouldn't be surprised if they go out and find someone they have someone well I'm just saying a body you just said can't make a trade got a guy off the street maybe if the guy off the street there's a reason why he's on the street well there are some practice squad guys around the league you could pluck off I mean it just depends on what I was just going to say the we talked about that today is that viable put him asked awesome about that and he poo pooed that like crazy on Thursday like he's an outside guy I'm like yeah what about everybody gets hurt and three of them got hurt since then but they're moving guys you saw TJ in the middle of the field a couple of times today in pass coverage right you so I mean like they can they can try to they can try to disguise it but I mean you know it's not if they're going to give the ball to you know hit the ball up 45 times next but anything that takes TJ and high Smith away from pinning their ears back and going after the quarterback again reduces the number of turnovers you're causing and the amount of headaches you're causing for the opposing quarterbacks which especially against burrow and Watson that's wow those guys were somewhat neutralized today by Green Bay as they were against the Houston Texans when

Today, we are gonna take traditional hamburgers and bring in some ocean flair. Chef. We're making a shrimp burger. Where in the world did you think of this concept? I don't know. Actually, you just said, let's do it, let's try it. OK. So we're gonna make it here for y'all. What's the first step you need me to? The first thing we need to do is put a little bit of oil to our pan. What kind of oil is this? So this is just a little bit of vegetable oil. OK? Tell me when that's good. OK. The pot is hot right now. Then we're gonna do. So I grind up shrimp. Like I do burger meat. You literally grind that up, did you? That's shrimp. And for someone at home if they would they, is it a grinder easy to get or like it is not? OK. I don't recommend trying this at home. I just recommend coming to my food truck there. You go. That's very smart, very slick. And you said you just did shrimp only, right? So that's the filler. So we're just gonna oil the bottom of the spatula. So that way we can spread it out like a P, will you get this off there so that you can get all the shrimp? You can't leave any shrimp behind. Ok. A little bit of kosher salt. Ok. Like a little Sprinkle Sprinkle Sprinkle. Is that enough? Maybe a little more? That's good. Ok.  So this is just like I said, straight shrimp. No filler. No, nothing. It's honestly just a little bit of oil, a little bit of salt. When you have a good ingredients, you don't need to mask anything with a lot of flavor. That's a great point. I feel you're a big believer of that. I'm a huge believer in that. And I also, you'd like to use the heat of the pan or whatever I'm using to uh help season the food because higher heat or lower heat will make everything taste a little bit different as well. Good tips from chef Jose for sure. So this is cooking on one side. We're gonna start making the sloth. Yes. So it's a sloth. So it's gonna consist of green cabbage, green cabbage. So slightly nicely thin green cabbage. I may have admitted this to you before, but I'm terrible at cutting cabbage. I feel like it's one of the hardest things. Well, the trick for that is there's a mandolin so you can just shave it. So you OK, you're OK. So then no green cabbage, cilantro leaves, cilantro. OK. A little bit of uh green onions, like a little of half of that half of this. I like green onions. So, and then a little bit of sliced jalapeno, sliced jalapeno. I'm gonna put three guys because if I'm gonna eat this chef, let me be honest, like you already know it a little bit of sesame seed. OK. Yum. Toasted sesame seeds. I like that a lot. And then this is a little bit of sriracha aioli that we're gonna see. How do you make that sriracha? Is it mayonnaise based? So, yes. So we make our own mayonnaise and then season it with a little bit of a sriracha and garlic and you make your own mayonnaise. So on the food truck, we make all our own sauces. Nothing is processed. Sounds like you're saying all your food is fresh to order, right? Even our ketchup. Oh Even your ketchup, ketchup. I'm a sauce queen. I definitely need to get out there because that sounds extra good. OK. So I'm gonna, while you mix that, I'm gonna flip this. OK. So mix it all up. Yes, ma'am. Yum, you know, I'm also not a fan of slaw but this, this is kind of, everybody always thinks that it's like coleslaw honestly to tell you the truth. I'm not a big fan. Of the soggy cabbage. So I'm a big texture person. So this gives it, that keeps it that nice crisp yum. I trust you. I know. You know, really well with the shrimp, the shrimp will be nice and sweet. We use a brioche bun that we butter and toast. So that'll be a little bit of sweet and we'll get a little bit of spice from the slaw. Yum. Oh, man, this looks so good. You're so right though. It's all about like texture and a big thing. That's a big thing. I love a crunch. Exactly. It's like even the sesame seeds. I think I'm gonna throw in a couple more. Yeah, I'm not a fan of eating baby food for sure. Yes. Let's add the sesame seeds who loves sesame seeds and honestly believe it or not, those little sesame seeds pack a punch. So it's a good flavor. Right. And did you toast them or you can buy them toasted? You can buy them toasted. But we did toast. You just like little oil. Yeah. No oil at all. No oil. No more tips from chef. Ok. So the patty is still going up. Can you tell me about some of the other items we have on the table while that finishes on our food truck. We have a little bit of everything. Honestly, I try to have something for everybody. So this is gonna be our chicken and waffles and it's served exactly like that. With a fried egg, um, waffles and then a little bit of uh syrup. This is our chicken bacon guacamole sandwich. It's very popular here in San Antonio. Very straight forward chicken baking guac who wouldn't want that famous shrimp burger? And then of course, we have to have a bacon cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger, man. Oh, that looks so good. A lot of comfort food. You know, Carmen, our producer was like, is it comfort? But I was like, no. And then now that I'm thinking about it, this is definitely kind of, but we do have a little bit of, more of interesting. We have like a kimchi chicken sandwich. We have kimchi pork belly fries. We have a BLT which is actually uh braised pork belly kimchi eel sauce. It's really, really like your favorite things or you just said I want to throw a cool menu together. What is it? So I wanted to have something for everybody. I didn't want somebody to come out to my food truck and walk away. So I needed to make sure I had something for everybody. Oh, wow. Well, I mean, that sounds great. I look at on your screen right now. You'll see all the other items he's talking about as well. Love some fries. All right, chef. Let's pack up the ready the burger. Ok. So this is our toasted brioche. M Sure. So we are gonna place our shrimp patty which has a nice uh crust on the outside. We're gonna top it off with our slug. Yeah, look at that. I made it all myself. Is that enough or a little more uh whatever you like just a this is we're here for you. Thank you. I gotta share with Paul right now in a little bit. But chef, how can people reach out to you? I know you are a personal chef as well. We're always so proud of you. He cooks for all the Spurs players and you have your food truck. So people wanna get out and see you. So our food truck is a curb food truck at uh on Instagram or you can look me up at uh chef Jose B on Instagram as well. You can reach out through there. Ok. Well, try. We're actually at the divide as well at the divide. Chef. Thanks so much for being with us, Paul. I need your opinion. What you think about this shrimp burger? Am I gonna love it? Oh, I think you are gonna love it. Look at that thing, by the way, I've seen one of those grinders, those shrimp grinders, they're like really, really small and you put the little shrimp in there and you just grind it up there. It's Yeah. Anyway.", "aigc_title": "Creating a Unique Shrimp Burger with Chef Jose Benita", "aigc_article": "Discover a unique twist on a classic American dish with Chef Jose Benita's shrimp burger.

Cellsound body contouring give Nuvell Clinics a call at (480) 459-5262 or visit, ...", "video_transcript": "The Glitz and glamour of the holiday season is upon us and if you're not feeling festive because of excess fat on your belly and thighs there is a brand new treatment and patients are seeing instant results this is Kayla McQueen she is a laser technician here at Newville clinics in Scottdale and this is a brand new treatment what is it called it is called cell sound cell sound and you're the one actually doing the treatments you're seeing inches disappear right before your eyes what are you thinking it's phenomenal to see just the variety of results from people that were seeing all the way up to three and a half introduction from your first treatment all the way up to an inch and a half all right so tell us about this patient yeah this is Christine Christine is a mother of three um so here is her starting before and this is after a full session of six treatments with cell sound okay uh this after was taken uh immediately after she got back from a weekend in Mexico so she was sitting there enjoying herself uh and was able to maintain pain and hold her results how many inches are we talking about so she lost over an inch and a half in all areas both upper mid and lower abdomen and she's a mother of three mother of three and she already had a relatively flat tummy but I understand here these are those trouble areas that people talk about look at how tiny she is yes it's amazing all right so the first patient that you did Anthony and I heard there were scream there were screams going on we were so ecstatic over his results oh my goodness so what did you see with Anthony how many treatments what kind of results are you talking about so with Anthony we saw immediate reduction in inflammation with his photos so we had over three and 1 half introduction in both upper mid and lower abdomen on him which was outstanding look at the difference some of the best ones we've seen we can also see the reduction on the side here with him and so uh after his treatment we were all just talking about how amazed we were from a single treatment single 40 minute treatment how many inches 3 and 1/2 Ines what does the treatment feel like Kayla it's buzzing sensation tingling sensation some involuntary movements from the electrodes that we use and then with the non-focused ultrasound hand piece you can get uh a gentle warmth that happens internally from the resonance that we're creating yes and what how important are these images you take pictures before and right after right so we'll do pictures on the first treatment the third treatment and the six treatment and what makes this green screen so so special uh is that it's precise laser measurements so you're never going to have that human error of uh using a measurement tape yes a tape measure we're looking at some additional before and afters as I come over to here to Eric jansy and you have tested and trained on just about every body contouring machine out there why a cell sound so different well all the other devices out there that we've tested from you know the crypsis to freezing this cool sculpting or we're using you know focused ultrasound which is using thermal energy we're just hitting a very superficial layer of five we're hitting maybe the first to eth inch of fat and with cell sound we're reaching every single layer of fat we're debulking every single fat cell all the way from the subcutaneous fat and then with Anthony you saw the pictures with the amazing photos he had a lot of visceral fat as well that's a fat that makes the stomach protrude out and so we're reach able to reach visceral fat see the only device in the market that can reach visceral fat will the fat come back no the Fat's not going to come back it's fact it's going to be even better so you know somebody still needs to to nutritional and that but we're going to revascularize those fat cells and the reason we're putting all those that fat on that we're gaining as we age is the fact that we're losing the ability to burn fat as an energy source we should be using fat as an energy source and we're not able to do that so we're going to revascularize all those fat cells as we're debulking them so now we can turn the clock back why should someone come here to newal clinics well one we got the only device in the market that's going to reach every fat layer you know doing that and again because I train people from across the Crunch and how to do this we're just able to to use the best equipment for for what you need not just to say we've got this device and this is all we have yeah and patients are coming here to kind of reverse some of the effects of the other devices so there there's there's a lot of side effects of some of the cryopen so we got hardening of the fat cells in there and we're able to reverse that and smooth out those results with it with the with the ultrasound with the cell sound well if you're ready to try cell sound nvo clinics is offering 30% off their cell treatment packages in addition the first 10 Sonoran living callers who book an

I'M COURTIS FULLER ....AND THE FIRE CHIEF OF THE CINCINNATI FIRE DEPARTMENT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I DO NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. VERY PROUD OF. JUST AS YOU WILL HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE, I'LL HOLD THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE AND THEY WILL HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE. SO FROM WLWT, THIS IS LET'S TALK CINCY, PRESENTED BY WESTERN AND SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP. PUT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH BEHIND YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. I'M CURTIS FULLER AND WELCOME TO LET'S TALK CINCY TODAY A ONE ON ONE WITH CINCINNATI'S NEW FIRE CHIEF, FRANK MCKINLEY COMES TO CINCINNATI WITH A VERY IMPRESSIVE RESUME TO LEAD THE NATION'S FIRST PROFESSIONAL AND FULLY PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT. HE'S TASKED WITH CLEANING UP THE DEPARTMENT'S CULTURE AFTER THE CITY MANAGER FIRED HIS PREDECESSOR HOUR AFTER A SIX MONTH NATION WIDE SEARCH, MCKINLEY WAS CHOSEN OUT OF MORE THAN THREE DOZEN APPLICANTS IN SELECTING CHIEF MCKINLEY, THE CITY MANAGER SAID THE COMMUNITY AND THIS DEPARTMENT ARE READY FOR A FRESH START AND A NEW VOICE OF LEADERSHIP AND THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE MY DUTIES AS A FIRE CHIEF, MY DUTIES AS A FIRE CHIEF OF THE CINCINNATI FIRE DEPARTMENT OF THE CINCINNATI FIRE DEPARTMENT. AND WITH THAT, A NEW ERA BEGINS IN THE LONG HISTORY OF CINCINNATI'S FIRE DEPARTMENT. FRANK MCKINLEY, SWORN IN AS THE DEPARTMENT'S 19TH FIRE CHIEF. IT WAS FITTING THAT THIS CEREMONY HAPPENED IN THE FIRE MUSEUM, A PLACE THAT PRESERVES THE LEGACY OF THE FIRST FULL TIME PROFESSIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE NATION. AND IT'S CLEAR MCKINLEY UNDERSTANDS AND IS GRATEFUL TO BE A PART OF THAT TRADITION. WOW. I'M SO GRATEFULLY HUMBLED AT BEING THE FIRE CHIEF OF THE CINCINNATI FIRE DEPARTMENT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I DO NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. VERY PROUD OF MCKINLEY WAS CHOSEN BY THE CITY MANAGER, SHE SAID. SAYS SHE WAS IMPRESSED BY HIS CALM AND STABLE DEMEANOR. WE HOPE THIS DEPARTMENT TO VERY HIGH STANDARDS AND IN TURN IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE LEADER OF THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THE SAME EXPECTATIONS OF THEMSELVES. MCKINLEY'S SISTER SAID THEIR FAMILY HAS A LEGACY IN FIREFIGHTING AS WELL. THAT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THEIR GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER FROM BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI. FRANK KNEW WHEN HE WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT HE WANTED A CAREER IN FIRE SERVICE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT WE DO, IT'S HOW WE DO IT. MAINTAINING THE DIGNITY OF CIVILIAN AND PATIENCE AND CUSTOMERS WHEN WE COME IN CONTACT TO THE PUBLIC IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I HOLD IN HIGH REGARDS AND WE WELCOME CHIEF FRANK MCKINLEY TO CINCINNATI AND THANKS FOR JOINING US HERE ON LET'S TALK CINCY. I STARK WITH YOUR SISTER SAYING THAT YOU WANTED TO GO INTO FIREFIGHTING IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A GREAT LEGACY IN YOUR FAMILY. YES. ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY IS ONE OF MY OLDER BROTHERS. AND HE WAS IN THE FIRE SERVICE. HE BEGAN IN 1981 WITH THE DALLAS FIRE DEPARTMENT AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT HIM AND TO VISIT SOME OF THE FIRE STATIONS AT THE TIME REALLY IMPRESSED ME AND TO BE A COMMUNITY. WE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO DELIVER SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WAS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. AND EARLY ON IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO DO. BUT IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT. YES. GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER, BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI. YES, SIR.  AND I ACTUALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT AFTER I WAS ALREADY IN THE FIRE SERVICE. AND SO IT KIND OF REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME THAT THIS HAS BEEN IN OUR FAMILY HISTORY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND SO I'M VERY GLAD TO BE A PART OF PUBLIC SAFETY. CINCINNATI HAS A GREAT REPUTATION IN FOR ITS FIRE DEPARTMENT. YOU COME FROM DALLAS, WERE THERE ALMOST 30 YEARS, MUCH LARGER DEPARTMENT. TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DALLAS AND THEN COMING TO A CINCINNATI BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE ARE SEVERAL SIMILARITIES. SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE FUNCTION, SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE, THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, OUR CAD SYSTEMS ARE SIMILAR. CENTRAL SQUARE'S A CAD SYSTEM THAT WE USE. AND SO A LOT OF THE INTERFACES AND NUANCES IN HOW WE DO BUSINESS ARE VERY SIMILAR. SOME OF THE EMS SYSTEMS AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN DALLAS VERSUS CINCINNATI ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, BUT THEY BOTH FUNCTION WITH THE SAME CONCEPT. AND SO WHETHER THERE IT IS A MUCH BUSIER, PROBABLY IN DALLAS, IT'S STILL A REAL IMPORTANT SERVICE, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EMS THAT WE DELIVER TO THE PUBLIC. AND SO WE ARE EVALUATING HOW WE DELIVER THOSE SERVICES AND MAKING MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY. SO THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT. I WAS ASKING YOU, HAD YOU EVER BEEN TO CINCINNATI BEFORE YOU CAME UP HERE BACK IN SEPTEMBER AND YOU SAID, NO, NOT REALLY. I HAD NEVER BEEN TO CINCINNATI WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE. AND WHEN YOU GET OFF THE PLANE AND NORTHERN KENTUCKY, YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S A JOLT, HUH? RIGHT.  I THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS. AND I SAID, HERE I GO. GETTING OFF TO A BAD START. I GOT ON THE WRONG PLANE. BUT AGAIN, I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. COMING INTO CINCINNATI. IT'S JUST SO PICTURESQUE AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THE LANDSCAPE, THE TOPOGRAPHY, THE HILLS. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. AND THE CULTURE HERE IN CINCINNATI, EVERYONE'S FRIENDLY AND THEY SPEAK AND THEY'RE VERY OUTGOING. AND AND SO I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ASPECT OF IT. AND EVERYONE'S MAKING ME FEEL REALLY AT HOME. WELL, THAT'S GOOD.  GOING BACK TO THE DALLAS DEPARTMENT, YOU HAD A HUGE BUDGET THERE. PROBABLY HALF OF THAT BUDGET FOR CINCINNATI. GIVE OR TAKE. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT COMES WITH ITS CHALLENGES WHEN YOU'RE FACED WITH SO MANY NEEDS IN A FIRE DEPARTMENT, YOU KNOW, YOU ORDER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT REALIZE IT. YOU ORDER A FIRE TRUCK AND IT DOESN'T GET HERE TOMORROW. IT TAKES A COUPLE OF YEARS FOR THAT TO COME. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE FACED WITH A LOT OF CHALLENGES JUST WITH EQUIPMENT AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. RIGHT. AND AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AS A TEAM. I HAVE A VERY OUTSTANDING COMMAND STAFF AND WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS REALIZING THAT WE HAVE TO DO A GOOD JOB OF PROJECTING OUR NEEDS FOR THE NEXT 2 TO 3 YEARS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE LOOKING AT 24 TO 36 MONTHS AND BEING ABLE TO GET IN FIRE TRUCKS AND FIRE ENGINES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE BE ABLE TO FORECAST AND PROJECT OUR NEEDS IN 2 TO 3 YEARS. AND SO WE LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO TO BE COMPREHENSIVE OF LEVERAGE, SING SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY EQUIPMENT SO WE CAN PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO THE CITIZENS. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT. I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN OUT AND ABOUT IN THE COMMUNITY TALKING WITH PEOPLE. WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO REALLY LISTEN TO WHAT FOLKS IN THE DEPARTMENT OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT HAVE TO SAY. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE IN JUST A MOMENT. I WANT TO COLLABORATE.  ALL RIGHT. AND SO FOR ME, OUT OF EVERYONE AND WE HAD WE HAD I THINK IT WAS MAYBE 12 APPLICANTS THAT WE HAD, HE JUST REALLY HAD A STEADY HAND AND HAD A A DISPOSITION TO WHERE HE JUST REALLY WANTED TO LEAN IN AND TAKE THIS ORGANIZATION UNDER HIS WINGS AND REALLY SUPPORT IT. WELL, COME BACK WITH ME IS FIRE CHIEF FRANK MCKINLEY. WE ARE JUST TALKING. THIS IS HIS FIRST CHANCE. WE HAD A CHANCE TO JUST SIT DOWN. LET ME READ YOU SOMETHING THAT I SAW THAT WAS ON YOUR APPLICATION. IT SAYS, I HAVE EARNED THE REPUTATION OF ONE WHO DELIVERS IMPACTFUL AND DATA DRIVEN OUTCOMES WITH CULTIVATING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COLLEAGUES AND CONSTITUENTS. YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO LISTEN THE FIRST 30 DAYS OR SO TO FOLKS INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT AND OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT. HOW IS THAT GONE SO FAR? OUTSTANDING.  IT'S BEEN TREMENDOUSLY OUTSTANDING THING TO GET OUT TO THE FIREHOUSES AND TO TALK TO THE FIREFIGHTERS AND TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND THE DESIRES, THE WANTS AND WHAT REALLY MAKES THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RUN. AND IT'S REAL IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO THOSE, BECAUSE AS WE SIT BACK AND WE MAKE OUR STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN, WE HAVE TO TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT. AND AGAIN, YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT WHAT WE DO, IT'S HOW WE DO WHAT WE DO. AND SO HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR MEMBERS IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND ALSO EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH CHIEF TEAGUE, THE POLICE CHIEF, AND UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IMPACT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND HOW WE CAN BE MORE COLLABORATIVE ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO. YOU KNOW, PARTICULARLY TRAINING AND UNDERSTANDING OUR RESPONSE MODELS AND THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND REALLY HELP THE CITIZENS OF CINCINNATI BE SAFER. YEAH, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CHIEF. SHE HAS A SIMILAR BACKGROUND. A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AS YOU HAVE IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AT YOUR SWEARING IN. YOU TALKED ABOUT A SAFETY CONCERN NOT ONLY FOR THE CITIZENS, BUT ALSO SAFETY OF YOUR YOUR MEMBERS IN THE DEPARTMENT. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. YES. AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF FIREFIGHTER DEATH IS CANCER. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HOW WE DO OUR BUSINESS S THAT WE'RE SAFE, THAT WE KEEP THOSE THINGS IN MIND. OUR RESPIRATORY PROTECTION AND HOW WE DO THAT ON EMERGENCY SCENES. ALSO JUST LIVING STYLES AND WHAT WE DO AROUND THE STATION, MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT AND BE MUCH SAFER PHYSICAL WELLNESS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE STAY IN SHAPE. WE DO A GOOD JOB. WE'RE PREPARED TO DO OUR JOBS. AS YOU KNOW, WE CAN GET CALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WAKE UP FROM A DEAD SLEEP AND BE ON A ROOF AND IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. AND SO THAT HAS AN IMPACT. AND SO WE WANT TO YOU KNOW, KEEP THESE THESE THINGS IN MIND, MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF MONITORING THE HEALTH OF OUR MEMBERS AND AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS, TOO, IS, IS THE MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO WE HAVE A PEER SUPPORT GROUP THAT WE'RE EXPANDING THAT. WE'RE INVESTING IN. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT BECAUSE THEY THEY HELP OUR MEMBERS PROCESS SOME OF THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT. AND SO WHEN WE SAY SAFETY AND LIFE, SAFETY, THESE THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR MEMBERS SO THEY CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS. I'M CERTAIN, YOU KNOW, THESE NUMBERS BETTER THAN THAN MOST. THE GENERAL PUBLIC MIGHT NOT KNOW. YOU KNOW, SADLY, WHEN YOU LOOK, YOU TALK MENTAL HEALTH. WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE NATION AT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES, FIRST RESPONSE OTHERS FACE, NOT JUST FIREFIGHTERS, FIRST RESPONDERS AND AND SADLY, YOU KNOW, MANY FIND THEMSELVES WITH ALCOHOLISM, DRUG PROBLEMS, SADLY, SUICIDE. I MEAN, THOSE ARE REALITIES FOR ALL FIRST RESPONDERS. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, THAT'S THAT'S SO IMPORTANT. IT IS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT OUR MEMBERS SEE ARE VERY TRAGIC. LIKE WE MAKE WE RESPOND TO MOST PEOPLE'S WORST DAY. AND SO TO PROCESS THAT AND HOW WE SEE THAT, TO TO GO BACK AND BE WITH OUR FAMILIES AND TRY TO LIVE OUR NORMAL LIVES AFTER EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE TRAUMA AND TRAGEDY THAT WE SEE OUT HERE, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE A WAY OF PROCESSING THAT INFORMATION AND NOT NOT RESORT TO SOME OF THESE OTHER NEGATIVE PROCESS GUESSES TO TRY TO GET BY. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EVALUATE THAT. A LOT OF TIMES WHAT YOU HEAR IN THE FIRE SERVICE IS WHAT WE DO WHEN WE GO ON THE SCENE. WE TRY TO SIZE UP A SITUATION. WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION, AND NOW WE SHIFT THAT FOCUS TO OUR MEMBERS. SO WE NEED TO SIZE UP OUR MEMBERS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THAT. WE CAN WE CAN SEE THINGS, WE CAN TALK TO THEM, AND TO HAVE THE SUPPORT MECHANISM IS JUST THAT'S NOT THE COMPLETE PACKAGE. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN MOVE THEM TOWARD THOSE SUPPORT MECHANISMS AND WE HAVE TO GUIDE THEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE THESE RESOURCES BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO MERELY JUST HAVING SYSTEMS AND HAVING THINGS FOR OUR MEMBERS IS NOT ENOUGH. WE NEED TO TAKE THAT ADDITIONAL STEP. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PUT THAT INTO ACTION AND GET THEM TO THOSE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS GOOD. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER BREAK AND WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE CHIEF IN JUST A MOMENT. WAS REALLY INTENTIONAL WITH THIS  INTERVIEW PROCESS. WE MADE SURE THAT WE HAD WE OPENED UP USUALLY IN AN INTERVIEW, YOU WANT PEOPLE TO DO THE RESEARCH ON THEIR OWN. RIGHT. BUT I WANTED TO SEE HOW PEOPLE'S BRAINS WORK. AND ONE THING ABOUT CHIEF MCKINLEY, THE INCOMING CHIEF MCKINLEY, IS THAT, FIRST OF ALL, HE WAS COOL, CALM AND COLLECT COOL, CALM AND COLLECT. HEY, I MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW, OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE SHE TALKED ABOUT DOING YOUR HOMEWORK. SO YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS RECENT CHALLENGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS FACED. I KNOW YOU CAN'T DISCUSS THOSE, BUT YOU'VE YOU'VE MADE A POINT AT SAYING WOMEN IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT NEED A VOICE TRYING TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS IN THE DEPARTMENT. JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CULTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT. YOU TALKED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY, HOW YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND IN REVERSE, THEY'LL BE HOLDING YOU ACCOUNTABLE. ALL RIGHT. AND AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE POWER IN WORDS, THERE POWER AND BEING HAVING A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AND THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT. AND THE FIRST 30 DAYS, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE MET WITH A LOT OF THE EMPLOYEE WORKGROUP ORGANIZATIONS, ANS LOCAL 48, THE UNION. I'VE ALSO MET WITH ERG, WHICH IS A WOMEN'S WORK GROUP, AND I MET WITH CAFE THE CINCINNATI'S AFRICAN AMERICAN FIREFIGHTER ASSOCIATION, AND IT'S REAL IMPORTANT TO LISTEN AND, AND LISTEN TO THE VOICES AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE THINGS THAT IMPACT INDIVIDUALS IS AND SO BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT IT FROM A GRANULAR LEVEL, EVERYBODY DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME NEEDS. AND SO MAKING SURE THAT THAT YOU CAN HEAR IT CLEARLY, MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE RESOURCES, MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE, THEN YOU CAN ANALYZE ALL THE INFORMATION AND COME UP WITH THE BEST PROCESSES. BUT IT HAS TO BE A CONTINUOUS CIRCLE TO WHERE YOU GET FEEDBACK BECAUSE AGAIN, WE CAN GO OUT AND CREATE A LOT OF PLANS, BUT HOW DO WE KNOW IF THOSE PLANS ARE EFFECTIVE AND WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN IN THE FIRE SERVICE, THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND SIMPLE. THINGS LIKE PEOPLE SAYING FIRE MEN, YOU KNOW, WE'RE FIREFIGHTERS. AND I LIKE TO HEAR THAT. OR MANPOWER, YOU KNOW, PERSONNEL JUST CHANGING, YOU KNOW, SMALL THINGS TO MAKE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY FEELS WELCOME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME IS MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE THEIR UNIQUE SELVES. AND I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO NECESSARILY ASSIMILATE TO TO WHAT THEY THINK. YOU KNOW, FIREFIGHTERS ARE. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE YOUR UNIQUE SELF. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THAT WORK. ENVIRONMENT MORE PLEASURABLE AND MAKE PEOPLE LOOK FORWARD TO COMING COME TO WORK AND AND DO A GOOD JOB. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THIS LISTENING AND LEARNING TOUR IS ABOUT IS TO BE BE ABLE TO BREAK IT DOWN TO A VERY GRANULAR LEVEL. YOU KNOW CINCINNATI CAN BE A TOUGH CROWD AT TIMES. FOLKS WON'T BITE THEIR TONGUE BEYOND ASKING YOU WHETHER YOU'RE A COWBOYS FAN OR ARE YOU NOW A BENGALS FAN. THEY'LL ASK YOU THAT EVENTUALLY, BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU'VE BEEN CHALLENGED BY SOME FOLKS TO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. I MEAN, THEY WON'T HESITATE. IN COMING FORWARD AND EXPRESSING WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE AND FINDING OUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AS WELL. WELL, YES, FOUNDATIONALLY, THERE ARE THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE WE ENSURE SAFETY. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE DISCUSSED. ALSO, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND KIND OF TO BREAK CUSTOMER SERVICE DOWN INTO TWO DIFFERENT FACETS. THERE'S INTERNAL CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE UNIFORM AND NON UNIFORM MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND EVERYBODY CAN'T BE THE RACE CAR DRIVER. AND SO YOU HAVE TO PULL INTO THE PIT, YOU GOT TO GET YOUR TIRES CHANGED, YOU GOT TO GET FUEL, YOU HAVE TO DO THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. AND SO IT'S ONE MISSION, ONE TEAM. AND I WANT THAT CONCEPT TO TO BE HOLDING HOLD HELD CLOSELY BECAUSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXTERNAL CUSTOMER SERVICE, MAKING SURE WE'RE PROFESSIONAL WHEN WE GO OUT AND WE COME INTO CONTACT WITH WITH PATIENTS OR CUSTOMERS OR JUST CITIZENS ASKING QUESTIONS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ALWAYS IN PLACE AND AGAIN, ALL OF IT TIES BACK TO EQUITY AND INCLUSION, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DEDICATE THE RESOURCES EQUITABLY AND HOW WE RESPOND THAT IS DONE EQUITABLY AND IS DRIVEN BY DATA. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE FAIR. AND THAT'S INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. YEAH, I KNOW YOU HAVE ABOUT 800 PLUS FIREFIGHTERS. I THINK, AND A RECRUIT CLASS RIGHT IN LINE NOW. SO WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AS WE COME TO OUR FINAL SEGMENT. CHIEF FRANK MCKINLEY. BACK IN A MOMENT. WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. IT'S A PLEASURE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO CINCINNATI'S NEW FIRE CHIEF, FRANK MCKINLEY. JUST BEEN ON THE JOB ABOUT A MONTH. LESS THAN A MONTH, ACTUALLY. THIS PAST FRIDAY, YOU HAD A RECRUIT CLASS, CLASS 121, ABOUT 53 RECRUITS. SO THAT'S ENCOURAGING. AS YOU GET STARTED BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WILL NEED MORE PEOPLE ON BOARD, RIGHT? AND SO CINCINNATI FIRE DEPARTMENT, WE'RE VERY SELECTIVE. AND THE CANDIDATES THAT WE BRING IN TO THE FAMILY AND IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROPERLY TRAINED AND THEY HAVE THOSE ABILITY TO DELIVER THE SERVICE AND TO BE PROFESSIONAL TO THE PUBLIC. AND SO I'M EXTREMELY PROUD OF THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. AND AS THEY PREPARE TO GO OUT AND PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS AND SO IT'S VERY, VERY EXCITING TIME FOR THEM AS WELL. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY THAT WE FIND DIFFERENT WAYS WHERE WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM AND CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THEM IN THEIR TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIRE SERVICE. SO I STATE THE OBVIOUS. IT IS A TOUGH JOB. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SEE FIREFIGHTERS OUT THERE, IT IS A TOUGH, TOUGH JOB, BUT A REWARDING ONE. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE BEEN IN IT FOR SO MANY YEARS. TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT. IT'S VERY REWARDING. IT'S A IT'S A PROFESSION THAT'S FILLED WITH PRIDE AND RESPECT. AND AS WE, YOU KNOW, GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY, WE LOVE TO WEAR, YOU KNOW, OUR SHIRTS OR OUR HATS AND THINGS THAT REPRESENT THE DEPARTMENT, RIGHT? AND SO AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR ROOKIES WHEN THEY'RE IN TRAINING. WHEN YOU REPRESENT SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY, THEY LOOK AT YOU AS A CINCINNATI FIREFIGHTER, AND SO YOU'RE HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD, WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. AND THE WAY THAT WE CONDUCT OURSELVES ON AND OFF DUTY IS A REFLECTION ON THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO IT'S VERY FUN TO, YOU KNOW, TELL OUR FRIENDS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GO BACK HOME OR GO TO A CLASS, REUNIONS, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING? HEY, I'M A FIREFIGHTER. AND AND IT'S A VERY RESPECTED PROFESSION, ALLEN AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF HONOR THAT GOES INTO THAT. AND I WOULD IMAGINE I KNOW YOU GET A CHANCE TO INTERACT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS PROFESSION. I WOULD IMAGINE WHEN YOU SEE A YOUNG PERSON WHO REMINDS YOU OF YOURSELF WHEN YOU WERE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEY LOOK AT YOU AS THIS HERO AND THEY MIGHT SAY TO YOU, I WANT TO I WANT TO DO THAT ONE DAY. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT DOES SOMETHING TO YOU. WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE I'VE SPOKE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BEING A YOUNG BOY GROWING UP IN BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI, WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I WOULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED IN A MILLION YEARS THAT I WOULD BE THE FIRE CHIEF OF SUCH A WELL RESPECTED CITY, A DEPARTMENT. AND SO SO IT'S VERY HUMBLING WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE THE PATHWAY THAT LED HERE AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S REAL ENCOURAGING. AND SO WHEN I DO HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAK TO YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN, I ENCOURAGE THEM. AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU TREAT PEOPLE RIGHT. YOU KNOW, GREAT THINGS HAPPEN. AND SO I REALLY, REALLY THINK THAT I'VE HAD SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GO TO SCHOOLS AND TALK TO STUDENTS AND I KIND OF LAUGH WHEN I SEE THE ONE THAT'S DISRUPTIVE IN THE BACK OF CLASS BECAUSE THAT REMINDS ME OF MYSELF. AND SO IT'S VERY HUMBLING. AND I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE I WANT TO CONTINUE TO VISIT THESE SCHOOLS, TALK TO THE KIDS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. JUST YESTERDAY EVENING WENT OUT TO A DRIVE RIGHT EVENT THAT WAS AT PAYCOR STADIUM AND JUST BEING IN THESE YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN'S LIVES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND I WANT TO BE AN AMBASSADOR FOR THE CITY AND THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO THESE THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. WELL, WELCOME AGAIN TO CINCINNATI, AND THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF THIS PROGRAM. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK. AND AND YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR TODAY. THANKS FOR JOINING US.

Lexington Christian Academy he says the past couple Seasons the team has had some pretty bad injuries because there are no ambulances at their games they've had to call 911 and wait for someone to arrive it has to be be perfect in order to get somebody offsite in here rather than having them here and getting to it immediately czer says the school has tried to get ambulances at games in the past but things haven't worked out after speaking with the team's head coach Setzer says he decided to pay to have an ambulance at their game on Thursday night we're just here to fill a void Matthew Ward is the director of Ems for Alpha event medicine the company seter arranged to have at lca's game we can do that initial assessment get the vital signs go ahead and start an IV if needed uh give some simple pain management get them out of the view and into a controlled atmosphere uh that's a little more private Setzer says when they travel for a away games other teams have ambulances when you see those there you're like hey you know we're we're good you know we're we've got the right people the right Tools in place to take care of these kids he wants lca's players and visiting teams to feel that same sense of protection in Le inton it's you know something that uh that I think we'll we'll get in the budget next year um I'm I know the school um and and they'll make it happen in the meantime though seter says he's arranged to have an ambulance at the rest of lca's home games this season in Lexington smantha Valentino [Applause] [Music] WKYT hello welcome back to the Robertson Insurance team of the week the Roberts Insurance team of the week is the betham bansy and they are the girls state state soccer championship for this year welcomeing uh Benes thank you guys for having us appreciate it William you saw him play so I'm gonna let you ask the first question with him well I mean obviously the first question is is uh well first statement let's say congratulations ladies on on a great uh SE season and and winning at all you know big uh big upset I think uh you know when when you think about the state of Kentucky and the history of the soccer uh defeating Sacred Heart the way you guys did uh big congratulations to that but how does it feel coach um I think we're still pinching ourselves to be honest with you guys it's uh you know to be there's one team standing at this point of the year and uh you know to not have an end of year speech prepared uh usually um every other team in the state has one every other coach does and um you know it's just I couldn't be proud you know to be the only team left standing uh to be a school of our size with 150 girls or so uh competing against some of the behemoths like a sacred heart in the championship game to come out Victorious as you said it's um it's an unbelievable feeling and the Community Pride associated with it and everybody's rallying behind us now and it's uh it's an amazing feeling so well your comeback was wonderful the ages coach talk about that and how you were able to overcome a great team like saet heart well one of the things one of our core values this year was composure guys and um just kind of overcoming having first moments and overcoming them and coming on the other end and um to be a part of a game like that you know that was the ultimate um test in composure for sure um and overcoming adverse moments and um again to play a talented team like them and to I think four goals are scored in the last nine minutes of the game and you know to be up two to nothing and give that away um they go up three to two with five or six minutes left just gutting for most teams but this team never wavered they have it all year we played from up you know we played from behind um and just to to come back and get not only The Equalizer with five minutes to play but the game winner with two minutes to play um from Tessa was honestly as legendary stuff and you know talking to some of the khsa guys and you know they've said that it's probably one of the best championship games in any sport in the history of the State uh in terms of the the last 10 minutes in the ending and to be a part of that not only win a state championship but to be a part of something like that was was extra special for the girls and certainly memories will all take forever and and they will and they can tell their grandkids about someday so um just amazing yeah I was going to say when we looked at it on paper coach not not really judging it by the specific school year here with this specific season but when you look at the history of the you know the Banshees taking on the Valkyries there uh you know we we definitely thought that you know sacred Hart was going to win this thing hands down but then you know you guys get off to a quick start Carly Thurman showed up big time there she always does um we're going to watch a couple of these goals and then Carly if you can just describe to me what was going on uh you know when you scored these two goals um that'd be awesome for us so we can hear your thoughts on it yeah yeah so for that one I was really just hoping I got to the ball before the keeper did and it worked out in our favor and I'm just glad I went for that ball and I did well coach want you introduce all of your players to us and we'll be able to talk to them here on the show sure uh we've got we've got the whole team here so uh okay you've got Presley Sparks right here on the left seniors there um senior midfielder hi Hurst uh senior Winger Chloe young uh Center back senior Carly Thurman you just met senior Striker Gracie zetman is our goalkeeper Ashley miles Tessa miles keny Clayton and then we've got a whole host of people behind you Bailey Roy Bailey Jud Rihanna Morgan Iris pageant Anna Co Aubrey Reynolds marado mly Parkinson Savannah Montgomery Zoe Thurman neie Chek Gracie Osborne Taylor James and T Morton so we've got the whole crew behind us here today my question is gonna be for the goalie with nine saves you were critical in the box there what were you thinking about out when when the sacred R came down and and they had a chance what were you thinking about every save you had I mean I was just I was honestly just hoping that my ability would show and I was trying to be the impact in the game and just I'm I was familiar with a lot of the players I play with a lot of them and the club and Next Level and everything so uh just having the knowledge of what I did have and being able to kind of read them a little bit was to my advantage but um just having everybody uh in front of me to kind of help me out a little bit made my job a little easier but I was definitely just make this make this catch like just really hoping I would make the save and I and I did so this one right here we go for uh you know Ashlin and Tessa uh you know those two goals that that uh you know were late in the game there that was a clutch after Sacred Heart done went up 3 to2 on you guys uh can you guys just describe to that and what's it been like you know going around Bown with uh knowing that you know those goals meant a state championship for your team obviously we were down a goal and I knew that we had to do anything we could to um equalize the game so whenever coach Scott said to push up on offense we all luckily put the ball back the net absolutely coach is there anything that any of your players want to talk about or you want to ask them on the show uh go ahead coach yeah um you know I can tell you it's been a it's been a team effort all all year and um you know I guess for our back line you know girls you guys were so good and understanding the game plan and Kenzie and Khloe and bayy Jud and Mariel and obviously Gracie um you know what was what was your thought process going to the game did you guys feel confident did you it feel like something we were going to be able to overcome obviously we knew that the strength of a player like LLY lond and how good she was and um you know obviously you guys you guys performed really well too on that stage I was just gonna say um I was hoping like the whole time we'd play SEC heart because them a tournament The Lex cath tournament and I knew they us but they also didn't have Lily L then so we didn't get the chance to play against her and she's a really great player and I think that showed because I think she had a few assists in our game but yeah we just kind of knew like we had to stay disciplined and we built a bond All Season we just kind of had to rely on each other and everybody just stood out bayy Jud and and Mariela had just amazing games and like I couldn't ask for better anything to add to that not much he kind of hit it all but we just definitely knew that like going in it was like the most important game of our lives and kind of not to mess up and we did pretty good Tessa what was your thought process obviously when that ball was cleared and what were you thinking in that moment well I don't think I could have gotten a better pass than the other girl so I really just had to take advantage of that open shot I mean I know I didn't have a lot of time so two touches Max and then I just I shot I shot it like I always do just got lucky it didn't go over congratulations to yall all you guys and not only for winning the state championship but having a 3.86 team GPA that's remarkable coach yeah like like I said we're student athletes first um here at Bethlehem and you know that's I couldn't be prouder of that as well first and foremost and these girls put in a lot of work um in the classroom and you see them studying on the bus and you see them studying beforehand and they you know they might have to wake up early to to study to make

Local News from KFDA: ...", "video_transcript": "back at Big Jim's Pizza Company with big Jim Bray and Courtney all with toads I want to start with you Jim I your restaurant really you know people say it's about pizza but for you it's really kind of about family and taking care of that customer and if they have a custom order like we were kind of talking about good fresh nutrients and uh nutrition for diabetes I mean you're kind of the guy to talk to and I love that Courtney how did that come about well like I said Jim's like family I've known him and Candi since I was a kid and so when we they've stood behind us in everything we've done and when we started toads and we needed sponsors and money they backed us completely and totally and and they're not just people who you know write a check or anything like that they do donations and they also really truly care so Jim was like you know how can I help and one of the ways that we figured out would be really cool is to we can do carbs we can count carbs with them so you know whether you're at kayen across the street or you're at gyms and you like to get something like I was talking about that's not prepackaged or microwaved corporate food you can come here and get a better option and he's all in he and Candy both are all in so I find myself I think that I would be better with my nutrition and my um I I'm just am tired of grabbing stuff and I I really am the type that can e a salad or can I want to do better and you've come up with some things that that really are better yeah yeah um we speaking about earlier is the crustless pizza is something that we've been doing for quite a while I I came up with it years ago and and I was calling it actually meat salad cuz I'm I'm not a big I'm not a you know not a huge salad guy but but I like the beat so I came up with that and then it ended up being turned into call the crustless because other people started doing it as well so tell me what is you know we were talking cauliflower and I've really wanted to do that in my own kitchen and I tried it one time didn't go good it's hard it is hard it is hard but is this this pizza right here is that an option with your with your dough or am I saying it right yeah um the the the cauliflower pizza is actually uh something that we use uh just because for the people with gluten intolerance or allergies like celiacs and things like that we started carrying that um we also have a gluten-free Pine pasta and gluten-free boneless wings um things like that so you have some more options we have I mean really aside from just diabetes we do take care of all kinds of people with with food sensitivities and allergies and and and needs for that for that matter that's what Bray was saying he was saying like this is by far his favorite place to eat because like you don't realize it's Big Jim's Pizza but he's got like sandwiches and all these salads like so many options and then Ray was saying all the Exotic pizzas like exotic pizzas like macaroni Pizza what that's a weird one but it's good and then he's not stuck with you know your traditional like meat lovers or pepperoni he can get all sorts of different you know different options like a taco pizza or like chicken ranch pizza my mouth's watering I can hardly talk so I really love it that that you went in there and did that in in not very long I know that you're prepared I know you know what to do but I really feel like that people I feel like when I call somewhere and I'm like can you do pizza with no crust mhm I feel like they're like what I don't think it's like that here right yeah we do our best to try and train our our phone people to be able to handle that and we also have our online order in where they can kind of do we get some pretty crazy custom requests on there for sure so well when you're eating corporate it has to be to scale you know what I mean so it's like what we you know we can't cut the crust off and it doesn't come that way out of the package so no we can't do that you know so that's what's really cool about Jim and candy like he said with everything everything across the board not just type one but to help wherever you can so you get like you know convenience in not having to make dinner or whatever but not as un nutritious conveniences like fast food incorporate one thing that Courtney said and I want to end with this and I I thought this was so right on and and I really felt it when you said it people are like hey Bray can't you just you know can't you just not eat can't you just like eat better can't you exercise more Tope one doesn't go way and people don't understand and that makes it hard yeah it I don't get offended easily but that's the part where it really hurts me like some people say like exercise and just really it's kind of like in a way to me it's just like saying trying to do it yourself you're not doing anything yeah that's the thing I was telling you like Bray was diagnosed at the age of three and he's 11 now so he's done this with me for eight years and and recently when we've been doing the news and stuff and the radio people can ask him and he's obviously very articulate so he can say you know how he feels and kind of you put the face with the disease and you see what it is you know and so like one of the things that he's been asked is what is what's most important to you that people know about type one especially during this month of awareness and his thing is the difference between type one and type two and it breaks my heart that that hurts his feelings and the fact that you know people are like well if the kid exercised it'd be eight better you know maybe he's eating too much junk food type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease and there is no cure and every time a type one eats or puts anything in their mouth less than water they have to dose themselves for insulin listen I'm proud of y'all helping other people taking something that could have been a done deal making and helping people aware and I love that big Jim it says a lot about you and your family Bray you're I just I love talking with you Courtney uh always a pleasure let we need to you're welcome we need to talk more and more about toads okay more people that know about us the more people we can help you know that's a we're really good at raising money we just need to get our name out so we can help these people who are rationing their insulin or get kids to Camp so they can learn how to treat themselves and how to take care of their own type ones the parents aren't worried or the grandparents and like me and Aunt isn't worried at all times and you know one of the things that toads has done for quite some time is we donate to the uh Camp new day which is the type of diabetes camp in the summer um this last summer we gave $20,000 to the camp and then this year at our shoot we committed to do $10,000 every summer in the name of Christian clay who was a type 1 diabetic that we lost so um it's something that we're just going to keep struggling through like keep powering through and make sure that we can do whatever we can to help those affected no quit in this group and I love it I love it so much listen Big Jim thank you so much uh cool cool guy and uh sweet family Bray I'll see you soon okay okay Al righty thanks so much everybody stick

homicide trial of Jessy Kurczewski. #trial #waukeshacounty ...", "video_transcript": "morning get my screen up ladies and gentlemen this case is uh this case is not a homicide the state has not proven a first-degree intentional homicide it's what everyone concluded on October 3rd 2018 it's was a suicide and everyone who came to the scene on that day concluded it was a suicide and they concluded it for a lot of reasons including what you saw which is a whole boatload of prescriptions that were laying around Lynn was ported pills and they were everywhere pills that were uh no longer prescribed to her and the the pills were found in her system she took all those pills and also when the medical examiner did the evaluation of the stomach contents pills were in there it's a what is called a poly drug overdose when somebody takes too many pills they com combination together creates can create exactly what happened here that is Lind stuff and Dr Thomas when she was here she said there was strong evidence let me see what I've this is the prescription medications in the living room and I don't want to forget about what was seen was at the scene remember people who were there that day weren't looking for eye drops that wasn't on their mind so there the suggestion that there were no eye drops is not true it's not proven by a fact it's just an opinion and when the people came in and testified uh law enforcement they agreed with us that they weren't looking for them and Dr B Agreed 100% eventually that there was a bottle of eye drops Al be not the ones with tetrah hydrosaline the ones that she would use in her actual eyes on the table next to her but if you remember at the beginning of the case when the state was asking what after witness were there eye drops here were their eye drops here the answer was always no but it wasn't true and what was surprising is that even after Dr B agreed that we had found the right uh the right bottle of um ey drops that were on the table that detective hoppy when he got on the stand and he sat through this entire trial still couldn't agree that there were eye drops at the scene even though it had been uh testified to by the state but it's similar to the deputy medical examiner when she looked and she saw the kitchen waste basket full of liquor bottles nobody took any pictures of liquor bottles she said she saw it she put it in a report but nobody in law enforcement ever bother bothered to photograph it that doesn't mean they weren't there that we know was there because she saw them and put it in a report otherwise it would be here today also arguing that there was no sign of any liquor they weren't looking for it but they noticed things that were all consistent with with uh a suicide there's the bottle of eye drops Dr B identified it we brought in the bottle those are eye drops it wasn't collected so the state says that they collected all this B load of stuff well what how about that one bottle that was right there on the table next to bottles of pills of all the things you wouldn't collect why wouldn't you collect that to make it it suggest that they weren't there thank goodness for one picture where we can find it because it wasn't collected doesn't mean it wasn't there because Visine or other types of uh ey drops that also have tetrah hydrosaline in them and there's any number of them you saw them as exhibits during the trial just because they were not collected or noted doesn't mean they weren't there she had tetrah hydrosaline in her system now Lynn had water bottles there's one we can see caps for two water bottles we don't even know where the other water bottle is again not collected certainly these things should have been collected should have been available to be analyzed you're going to charge somebody with the first deegree intentional homicide and yet you don't have the evidence to be able to test it to look at it to evaluate it sorry everyone at the scene concluded it was a suicide ladies and gentlemen it it was a suicide it looked like a suicide for Dr B to say a year later that the scene looked staged how how can how can we wrap our heads around that if the scene look staged then on October 4th of 2018 when she did the autopsy she should have been right out of the gate look at this scene it looks staged because part of her autopsy right it was to look at all these photographs that had been taken at at the scene by her Deputy medical examiner and the facts and circumstances look at Lyn's body look at how it was positioned the the the drugs that she had spilled on herself she saw all that on October 4th of 2018 she had a body next to her to compare the body that's next to her with what was fresh evidence hey law enforcement this looks staged I want you to rush over to that home I want you to go look to see what else you can find because I don't think this is a suicide she didn't do that is it didn't look staged because it wasn't staged and the suggestion that these the that these fragments uh or powder pills that Lynn was obviously using to be able to take the drug she decided to take that because they were spilled in such a way it's staged no Dr Thomas explained it's much like eating a eating anything that has that has crumbs right whether it's a powdered sugar donut or something else that you're eating and you've got crumps they spill on you and there's no way to say that way the body was on um at the scene that that there was no J jostling or movement of that body between there and getting it to the medical examiner's office because of course there was Dr Thomas done more than 5,000 5,000 autopsies she's so very experienced at this said they're always going to be jazzling of the body from pulling her out of the chair to putting her on a on a gurnie to putting it the body in a body bag to taking it in the car back to the medical examiner's office and all the things they have to do of course the body was juggled and jled now when we were when the medical well in the trial with the Plain View eye drops that were ever gathered that we've established in trial that nobody ever noticed because remember too Dr B when she first testified said there was no evidence of it at the scene it's only when we saw it that anybody else saw it if you're not looking for it you don't see it we learn though that in her belly we learned through Henry Spiller didn't we that in her belly was a teaspoon of isine one teaspoon of isine and we looked at a bottle of isine and we learned that a teaspoon is about a third of a bottle that's how much was in her belly Dr Thomas looked at the scene and that's what you see that's what um when you get a second opinion on a of death and a manner of death what the what the second pathologist does is really take a look with fresh eyes at everything and what she looked at were the same things that the that Dr B looked at no she didn't have the body in front of her but there's nothing about having the physical body in front of her of Dr B that led to any conclusion that Lind died of tetrahydrozoline poisoning but what she does have is the benefit of of all the scene photos all the autopsy photos which we didn't show you but there's there's dozens and dozens of them as the medical examiners doing her evaluation she takes a picture of everything along the way so that if there is a second uh evaluation done the second pathologist can see what she saw with her eyes she also had the slides she also reviewed the slides she also has the toxicology and the reports and the medical records she had all of that and she told you that it is undetermined but strong support for suicide or even an accident which can happen somebody takes too many pills the wrong combination can accidentally die too as far as it being staged this is what law enforcement said oops just a minute I don't know if we don't have volume for some reason plate and Spoon away from her but I've also brought back to her because there were certain pills she couldn't swallow physically she couldn't I mean we sit there and they come back up sit there and they come back so I mean I went it went both ways as far as the pills she crushed I mean I didn't sit there and let her crushed 20 pills in my presents you know I let her the the main few that she always did usually if I come back there'd be more or different ones or you know you can tell by looking at a plate you know obviously they're all white you can't tell but I mean I'm telling you I know when I left every day and they come back and the pill mounts aren't what they should be and then she always kept pills on the side of her that weren't that she didn't take anymore and those were suddenly getting put up on the table and she all right I grab those by you know she make up stuff and she'd act like she didn't you know like oh I didn't put those there or L crushed your pills and Jean tanel the neighbor who the defense called in said that when she would see Lynn she was usually drinking uh two B oops two bottles uh of water and she told law enforcement back then despite what she might have remembered in court four or five years later five years later at the time that she was interviewed by law enforcement she told them that Lynn was suicidal and alcoholic and that Lynn wasn't nice when she was drinking of course Lyn was was nice many times of course Jesse had a very good relationship with Lynn and other people at times did but when Lynn was drinking a lot or maybe using a lot of drugs she wasn't a a nice person to be around and Jean Jean said that and the alcoholism is supported by the medical records remember she had the signs of alcoholism that were seen by Dr B and testified to by Dr Thomas it was there that's a fact and and remember Lynn being found at the scene she's got expensive bracelets on and there's water bottles around that presumably the states Theory as Jesse was trying to kill her with THC in the water bottles if you're going to do that um why would you one leave expensive bracelets on her why would you take those expensive bracelets off of her right why would you leave them and why would you leave the water bottles like any more than if you shot somebody with a gun would you leave the gun I don't think so you wouldn't leave it behind and would you keep calling the medical examiner for answers so yeah Jesse knew that Lynn would take THC take fine and drink it but she had a but it but she doesn't know how she died that day look like a suicide with pills from a person who was unhappy she kept calling the medical examiner and the only reason um medical examiner stopped talking to her or their office wasn't because they said we don't want to talk to her anymore it's because the detective put a hold on it and said don't talk to anybody anymore that's the reason that happened and Gary verden was here in cour he told you didn't he that he and that was a friend of Jenny's sure it's a friend but he saw Visine from the Geto he saw it in her garbage cans on the occasions that he was at her house and you know what if he was going to lie to you he's under oath like everyone else he's honest person on the witness stand I didn't detect any anything from him that struck me as dishonest objection if he's going to lie why not go all the way and say hey I saw her drinking Visine if you wanted to make up a story to help somebody that's what you'd say now Gary helped Lynn move he was he was in The Helpful friends circle the state puts up the friends put those two charts of friends well well Gary goes into the into Jesse and Jenny actual helpful friends who did things like help her move help her move her mother's things run errands for her visit her in the hospital those were that group of friends her real friends her real current friends sounds like Lynn varied friends from time to time but remember when Gary was here and he talked about the phone call that he heard he happened to be at Lyn at um at Jenny Jenny flower's home and Lynn's calling and and you heard testimony from people how Lynn would call just talk like to do that and the phone was on speaker and he could hear her talking for an hour longer what was one of the things that he told you he heard her say she had three ways she wanted to commit suicide also at the scene another issue is the rigor mortis it's Undisputed when did Lynn die when did she actually die if if if the deputy medical examiner had taken a temperature of her we might have um a closer idea but what we have that we can use is the rigor mortise and the state of it and it's Undisputed and unre regor mortis starts in the jaw the face and like and starts to move down to the arms from there it goes over the rest of the body and it your trunk of your body becomes uh R gets rigger moves to the large muscles of your legs and they get rigger but it hadn't gone to those spots on L it was at the beginning stages the deputy medical examiner agreed with us that it completes within six to eight hours and she arrived at the scene at 610 Deputy medical examiner arrived at 610 she said it took her 30 minutes to look at the scene to photograph because a a lot of the pictures that we've seen over the last three weeks were taken by the medical examiner herself she took them so it took her time to look at the scene look at the body and so on but her arrival was at 610 the police the 911 call was made right around 5:00 few minutes before it took her a while so rigor is is increasing in that time that's more than an hour hour and a half even from the time Jesse arrived at the home until she looks at the body so it had not moved down to Lynn's trunk it had not moved to her lower extremities and so we and that's consistent too isn't it with what Henry said about Henry Spiller about the drugs in her system and about how long had they been there he said a couple hours use the phrase a couple hours so what we can see by that by the state of that testimony of how long the drugs are in our system and how long how far prog the rigor has progressed that she's only dead a few hours she died in the afternoon not in the morning I pointed out the medical legal investigation of death book by Spitz and Diaz and and Deputy medical examiner didn't dispute that what was in there would be authoritative Lynn was being seen by a lot of Physicians the state has tried to suggest throughout this trial that there was nothing wrong with her or basically nothing wrong with her that she was not disabled not in bad shape that's what they have that's how they've presented the case to you but it's really not true and anyway does it really matter objectively what somebody how somebody might perceive her does it more matter how Lynn saw herself I think that's what really counts if somebody is going to decide to exit take their own life then it's because of how they feel right it's not because of how you or you or me or anybody sees her medical history it's how she feels about her life and her and her pain and she was in pain she saw herself as in a lot of pain and we've got records from Pain Management that back in 2017 the pain interferes with sleep with daily activities it makes her feel frustrated and at that time she did the oester uh score and is 31 out of 50 and we introduced the oest oester disability score and you know look at the things that a person rates themselves on it's how intense the pain is how intense it is to you how your social life is do you have a good social life or not how is your you know sleeping and how is your employment and how is your friendships and all of those things that you just feel it out and you let them know how you're feeling about yourself and apparently she saw when when this she filled out the answers we don't know what they were but however she filled them out the the when the when it was graded she came up with a 31 that's how Lynn saw her life as a 31 which is almost completely disabled really as how she saw herself and the pain interferes with her activities of daily living it says she she's had pain for a long time look at that Osteo arthritis in her lower Lumber spine since 1991 numbness weaking we weakness and her legs bilaterally pain aggravated by her ADLs activities of daily living and on her urine green from September 26 17th is appropriate for Al pasalan but inappropriate for lamap Pam it's not prescribed to her we'll we'll repeat at another visit again she's not taking the pills away she's supposed to she's taking them not as prescribed and again they're stopping the opioids we're going to stop the opioids and you heard didn't you throughout this trial the dangers of benzos and opioids and we know that we didn't probably even need to have people tell us about it because we know it from what we hear our overdose deaths the dangers of it but here you know she's got inappropriate pills in her urine screens she she was breaking her Hy hydrocodone in in in in half so she could make them last longer uh some things are giving her some relief and and some are not not but her she's got a lot of risks now doesn't she she's got risks of respiratory depression mortality for taking opioids concurrently with the benil her primary care physician and herself this doctor uh think it's important to stop one of the drugs and again again we've got the osteoarthritis the problems continue and they got so bad didn't they that she's got so many drugs in her and along with alcohol that Lynn's been discharge from the practice the from her primary cares practice because of of non-compliance and again inappropriate for alcohol the state at the beginning of the case remember asked their witness Dr B whether was any evidence in the record that Lyn had any problems with her eyes no evidence but it wasn't true and I know it was painstaking as I was going through those if we can remember back to day one or two as I was going through all those medical records with Dr B but there was reason because it wasn't true and I thought it was important that this jury you ladies and gentlemen see that in fact she's been complaining about dry eyes and eye pain for a long time well that those statements weren't factual again she was offered the referral to a pain psychologist she declines it um she declines nutrition services she declines uh physical therapy and record after record if you want to see it you can ask Maybe possibly we can send those back for you to look at but again after again uh she's encouraged to to to exercise to quit smoking and to not mix these pain pills but it isn't just at at Advanced Pain Management it's also at Aurora another facility where she was seen and and we can see that she struggled with anxiety uh and they had a discussion didn't they with the effects side effects of taking benzils and opioids and the risk of morbidity and so that was a discussion and you know her doctor says due to her pain all she does is sit around and smoke sometimes three packs per day I think there's 20 cigarettes in a pack that's 60 cigarettes in a day day after day that's all she's doing has chest tightness because of it she continues to complain of GI issues and can eat only very little so she says eating very little yet she's gained 30 pounds since December I don't know how how that happens if you're not eating again she comes in for medication management they told her I'm not going to increase the benzo dipin that you're taking um as the dose increases your side effects increase and your AG increases the side effects she's now in her 60s I'm going to try her on Lexa Pro a half a tablet she got heart palpitations and she has numerous risk factors heart disease obesity hyper Lip lip demia for which she's refused statins tobacco use recommends stress test concerns the doctor doesn't even list them because there's so many instead she says she has complaints or concerns which include numerous in capital letters with an exclamation point the woman was a complainer and I'm not here to bash Lynn but this is just the person we're dealing with here she was complaining and notes such as she has depression or agobia fear of going out or uh she appears older than her age and psych she's very argumentative she seems to be depressed she seems to be uh talks about having nothing since her parents died a few years ago told another note I told her it's unsafe to take El pram and Narco high risk of cardiac death if she continues to take the noral I will not refill the Alprazolam I can't put my license at risk that's how bad it had gotten can you imagine that in the record doctor's afraid of her her own medical license Lynn gets very mad at me and says I am the one who referred her to pain management she wants some medication she really needs to go see someone new for a therapist but she won't do that she's depressed and again the suggestion that there's no problems with her eyes is uh not true December of 2017 she's at at seing Dr Rogers and there is uh a problem with eyes that is discussed uh she uses artificial tears at least four times a day so when the state searchs their case and asks their Witnesses if there any indication that she's got eye problems obviously the witness Dr B didn't really take a close look at the records it's just easy to say no because they want it to be a death by tetrah hydraline right that's the decision she made and they're going to stick with it and not look at the entirety of the woman's medical history to see what's accurate or not there's another note this is a new doctor Abdullah now she's discharged from her prime uh previous primary care physician Clinic due to breaching the contract pain management contract she tested positive for other substances uh she weaned herself off of oxy supposedly uh she's she's an only adopted child with no extended family she lives in a condo she bought and has a couple friends who come visit she also was at Pro Health and the main records we know from pro health is from her Hospital's St from September 15th through September 28th 2018 that's a long time Hospital does not keep you there for that looks like um 13 days unless there's unless you're not healthy we know that from our personal experience now the state suggested didn't they that Jesse was lying when she said that she brought Lynn pills lied about a camera lied about pills but it was true because it was in the record uh which we'll come to in a minute when she came to the hospital she was not um want a person that really looked like she she wanted to keep living because she signed to do not resuscitate she didn't want chest compression no shock no intubation she's made that decision and that's when she first arrives on September 15th that's how she felt there's the medications sent to the pharmacy for storage the patients's medications sent to the pharmacy for storage it was true when when when the information was asked by the state of their own Witnesses of whether or not there's anything in the record to suggest that Jesse brought medication to Lynn and they said no no no there it is and who else told you but the neighbor remember when the neighbor came over and or testified in court genene tanel and she also said that Lynn asked her to bring her medications but she wouldn't do it because of the cameras so if you don't even want to believe Jesse certainly have no reason to uh discount what is said by the neighbor pro health records the diarrhea liquid stools has been going on for four years this is not something recent the suggestion that somehow Jesse is doing something recently that's causing this four years she did meet with pallative medicine and they help patients and families dealing with serious potentially life limiting illnesses and to navigate their care she seemed upset refused to talk about doing what the gii was recommending which is apparently a colonoscopy but she's in the hospital for almost two weeks there's something wrong with Lynn she isn't in good health she doesn't want to do what GI recommends and frankly um if you remember the testimony was that she would be released on the condition that she'd have a full-time caregiver if not the record said she was to go to a nursing home Lyn didn't want to go to a nursing home Lynn doesn't have full-time care another Point remember the Witnesses were asked by the government any indication that that Lynn was needing a walker no none none another another thing that's not true because again she began walking with a walker it's in her medical record it started before she came to the hospital and there's a picture at the scene of the Walker on the couch she's got lots of past problems her medical history is is is significant don't let anyone tell you it wasn't it was to her so the state asked their Witnesses after witness remember any indication that Lynn was disabled they St Ed out their presentation by suggesting that the money she was getting from the federal government was for old AG Social Security that's what that they were testifying to until we got them to agree that the the that the money she was getting was for Social Security disability not for old AG Social Security and remember there's no indication the witnesses said that she was getting any free things from the the government there's no indication she was on food share or a food stamps or Quest nothing at all but the certified records were admitted that show that Lynn was in fact getting and we introduced these that she was getting free food as early as 20 15 or 20 15 sorry I'm just trying a blank on my date I think it goes back earlier than that for years even she was getting it for years so we've got a woman that the federal government has determined is disabled to the point that they're going to give her social security disability and the state's giving her food share which and it was 2015 I think when she uh she got it even before 2015 now we did hear the state brought in about the other the other friends and I have no doubt that they care about Lynn in some way but the person really who was there day after day day after day day after day after day to care for Lynn and to watch movies with her and to and to go shopping and yeah you know Lynn gave her money no doubt it was Jesse they they brought in Jim kareim uh I'll get to her in a second but before her what about Jim ker you know they the state brings in Jim ker who wants to deliver a birthday present to her in September her birthday was in June that's a very close friend isn't it who's just thinking thinking about giving a birthday present 3 months after your birthday and we do know that as to Karen posa who came in she had a bit of a poor memory and I can understand that after the passage of five years our memories aren't as good as they were back back when something happened it's hard to remember precisely it's hard to remember even nine months later 6 months later sometimes even a week later so I understand that five years have elapsed but she denied remember the discussion with her about the um about the safety deposit box and in the safety deposit box was supposed to be $50,000 that Lynn had put in there and we asked Miss posa isn't it true that you told police back when you were interviewed originally about this that Lynn had told you she had taken them that 50,000 out of the safety deposit box and she said no but through the questioning of detective hoppy he was able to tell you that actually back when Miss po was interviewed before or five years ago that she did in fact tell him that Lynn told her that the money that Lynn had taken the money out of the safety deposit box it wasn't in there anymore she took her own 50,000 out of it and state wanted you to think that Jesse did that that she took 50,000 cash out of it it was taken out by Lynn who knows when also on this stand Miss posa says oh we're such good friends Lynn and I were such good friends till the end very good friends but back in five years ago when she was interviewed and this was verified by detective hooby when she was interviewed five years ago and asked how good a friend she was with Lynn that time right after Lynn died she said we used to be very good friends not so much the last couple of years not so much the last couple of years this group of friends wasn't such good friends the last couple of years Anthony well Karine said she last Saw Lynn in February 2018 that's that's that's a lot of months for a very good friend these are the the the cards that were brought into court right and submitted to the FBI lab ultimately is known handwriting of Lynn hnin and Anthony posa T talked about these documents and and he compared these and he also was talking about another document wasn't he in court where he said I know that document could not have been written by Lynn because two reasons the two reasons were my mom's name Karine is misspelled and two she use my mom's maiden name now as to the second Point let's say if you've been friends with somebody for 30 years we can all relate the people we've known since high school we know them by their maiden names people we've known for a long time since they were single we know them by their maiden names we have them saved by their maiden names I think of my high school friends by the maiden names so there's nothing at all suspicious in fact it suggests that that Lynn probably did write it because what's the chance of Jesse if that's the suggestion Jesse knowing what Karen posa's maiden name was the other point he said was that she couldn't spell she would never misspell my mom's first name but then they brought in the cards and her name is spelled differently in almost every card if you look Karine with an E there's an i in that one I mean there's one two three four cards and every one of them has Karine spelled differently the Lynn couldn't spell first names apparently but to suggest as Anthony did that the document isn't is not written by Lynn because Karen is misspelled is um contrary to in what our we know our known documents because suppose the family brought these in and and showed them of course uh they also said and Karine also said did she not that Lynn was always writing things at home she always had her pad she was writing Wheels she was writing documents that was something Lynn was known for and she would said there would be documents everywhere here and there all around the place so that's something that Lynn did that was Lynn writing new Wills writing obituaries writing cards writing letters writing notes that was Lynn that's something she did and most likely did even when she was in the hospital sitting there for almost two weeks when Jean was brought in to court and um said that denied that she had said Lyn was suicidal but we established it through the detectives that she was remember when the medical examiner was here and we introduced her own data the medical examiner's own data to show does it not that people do commit suicide this is for Walky sha County this were the years that she provided do um information on and we have plenty of people in the age range of the 41 to 65 and above 2020 there's 37 people in that two higher age ranges that that committed suicide and how do people Comm commit suicide you can see all the ways in wakesha county that has happened and it's sad we're sad that people ever feel that to that point that they um that that that that's what they want to do but people do it people do choose to exit", "aigc_title": "Defense Presents Closing Argument in Jessy Kurczewski's Eye Drops

And now it's expanding the nonviolent peace force is creating a hub in the northern part of the city. And you can check out the hub for yourself tomorrow night from 3 to 6 for an open house. It's at the former Aldi building on Lowry Avenue North and to help us better understand the Peace Force mission and what this expansion will mean for the city we're joined by my friend, Will Wallace the director of Community Peace Building in the organization. Uh My goodness, you all have a very big goal. But what would you say is the main goal of peace building and the Peace Force? Our main goal is to be able to uh work collectively with different organizational initiatives in North Minna to bring safety to that corner on lot in p you know, it's so amazing that we have you here today because literally the first three or four stories in our show today was all about the violence that we're continuing to see. You know, why will this hub having a physical location make a difference? Do you all think, well, I won't say make a difference because when you say different is like people think we use the competition, the difference would be that we have collected organizations that we would do this under this hub, right? And then also listening to the community, listening to that grandma that said that she needs to be safe walking to family dollar. And so as a collective effort with these organizations, we can be able to have 11 vision and one mission about what do that safety look like? And I say it again, reimagine, what do safety look like on that four corners in our community and then just have the community help us identify and then let's just solve it. I love that. You asked that question because I think we should, we should take a second to reimagine what safety looks like. You know, some folks might argue, man, do we can we even achieve safety? How do you have those conversations when you're talking to folks when you're trying to make things better? Well, it reminds me when I was seven or eight years old, it's our responsibility in the community to be able to provide safety for that community, right? And so it feels good when you knowing that a student that at Lucy Laney school can be able to walk to the bus stop, right? And feel safe. And so we it's our responsibility just to bring it back uh to the community And so I'm so hopeful. I'm so excited about it because I know we can make uh a difference uh with the community with us. I'm proud of you all because I know that things have to start in dream format, right? I mean, you all had to dream this up and you had to understand what the community needs, you know, dream with me a little bit more. What do you see, you know, in the future with this building and how you can move forward and how people can be involved in that? Well, dreaming big is just reimagine what safety look like and then also being able to invite the community as a whole. But then also, let's really talk about how can we collectively do it together as a community and bring safety and folks can get involved by just showing up coming to volunteer. We wanna be able to, to accept the community and really understand what is this causing the violence in our community. Then instead of always focusing on the problem, what are the potentials of that corner? You know, we wanna rebuild it, we want growth, we wanna invest. And so if we can invest and change it, then we'll begin to see difference. And so I'm excited. I always tell people to be encouraged. I if you're not encouraged after that, I don't know what else to tell you. And of course, we'll have more information at care 11 dot com tomorrow. Big day. Everybody invited big day tomorrow from 3 to 6 Lary and p come listen to some music, eat some food, listen to some stories. Uh We have amazing team so I'm excited.

Philadelphia Department of Prisons Philadelphia industrial Correctional Center Center on May 7th 2023 I will recite the points stated in resolution 23467 followed by my responses my testimony pertains to the resolution authorizing the Committee on Public Safety to hold hearings regarding the Escape of two inmates in the Philadelphia from the Philadelphia industrial Correctional Center on the evening of May 7th 2023 and the persistent systemic issues within the Philadelphia Department of Prisons that made such an escape possible the two escaped inmates exited through the recreational yard fence by crawling underneath an opening in the fence running to the secondary perimeter fence climbing on an exterior security alert pole that is no longer in operation in order to scale the second door perimeter fence and using a prison issued sweatshirt to move across the barb wire and make their way off the prison grounds to an awaiting vehicle the city of Philadelphia's Law Department contracted outside legal council to work with us uh the Department of Prison office of professional compliance as we conducted an extensive investigation into the events which allowed The Escape of two inmates from the Philadelphia Department of Prisons the office of professional compliance conducted an extensive investigation of the escapes to identify staff to be interviewed inmate phone call recordings security tapes staff assignments and fiscal tours of the Philadelphia industrial Correctional Facility the efforts of the office of professional compliance resulted in hours of interviewing and a preliminary draft report was shared with the outside legal counsel for their review PDP has also complied with any request it has received from the District Attorney's office while the investigation is still ongoing I'm unable to provide testimony on additional Personnel related actions that may occur as a result we took immediate steps to reassign executive leadership of the Philadelphia industrial correctional system uh Philadelphia industrial correction facility in May of 2023 and those executive leadership uh staff were replaced May 202nd and we have implemented the following security upgrades to prevent another escape attempt from the Philadelphia Department of Prisons specifically from the philadel for the Philadelphia industrial Correctional Center security upgrades are as follows we made immediate repairs of the prison fence of the recreation yard where the inmates Escape there has been installation and ongoing additional installation of razor wire along the immediate Recreation Area and outer fencing It Was the removal of the security alert posts that were no longer in operation they have been removed the installation of river rock along the exterior of fencing of PICC to prevent a soft Landing which could result in injury to one's legs and feet added an additional post for permanent roving by our prison vehicle installation of new correctional officers Booth with new gate arm in the PICC staff parking lot installation of LED lighting which gives us a brighter illumin Illumination in front of the uh pic administrative parking lot we reinforce policies for door security and yard patrols so to ensure that any door that is uh has a door it should be locked and then to increase our yard patrols yard doors remain properly secured when Recreation is not in use installation of additional cameras in front of uh PICC in addition to those upgrades for uh PICC the following have been completed for our campus grounds installation of LED Stadium lighting at the Detention Center uh which will allow which allows us greater illumination on our perimeter and visibility massive removal of brush and bushes for maximum distance sight throughout our campus and perimeter that was a huge undertaking but we achieved that so uh anyone we have a greater visibility the following upgrades are in progress and that is the installation of circuit wiring to install additional LED lighting on our perimeter uh along our campus installation of additional cameras for perimeter of Campus both on the campus and inside our facilities and installation of additional perimeter cameras for CFCF pick and RCF so those projects are in progress either through the procurement of um Contracting the uh beginning of the circuit wiring to install the that additional lighting and cameras we are dealing with the aftermath and impacts of the pandemic on our staffing levels at present we have correctional officer vacancies we continue our efforts to hire and fill uh uniform vacancies we work with the central office of Human Resources to allow for continuous job announcements allowing applicants to apply without breaks in the announcement additionally we continue our recruitment efforts through job advertisements on SEPTA buses and stops platforms radio ads and social media Outlets as well as participation at job fairs we strive to make Corrections attractive again in this competitive labor market and select qualified applicants this staff shortage is coupled with a static population that averages 4,700 plus daily the city committed to reducing its prison population by 50% in response to the MacArthur Foundation safety and Justice challenge to reimagine and rebuild local criminal justice systems by reducing jail incarceration increasing equity for all the city's initial efforts to reduce the prison population through collaboration with all of uh its Criminal Justice System made tremendous progress from 2015 to 2019 the population is now static averaging 200 in 23 days length of stay comprised of 89% pre-trial and 11% sentenced individuals the entire Criminal Justice System must resume its previous efforts to decrease the PDP population thereby to meet the initial goal of the mar MacArthur initiative and reduce the strain on the PDP operations the PDP continues to manage operations and conditions to best serve the population and our dedicated staff in service to the city of Philadelphia thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this testimony thank you so much commissioner couple of questions before I turn it over to members of the committee um what is the national average for uh facilities like yours over a period of time uh I know that the Chester situation um happened or are we above or below the um Escape levels of other comparable facilities uh council member because this is happening um I have not looked at if we're above or below but we are part of those National um jurisdictions that are experiencing escapes so we know what happened in Chester County we know what happened in three other counties here in Pennsylvania and most recently there were four escapes from making Georgia so these escapes are happening more routinely than was previously expected and it is based solely on the number of factors um Corrections and not too many folks are really talking about it but you and and this council member but the committee but Corrections we have been obliterated by the pandemic and we are challenged with trying to maintain a population that's static 4700 plus uh with a limited Workforce that are dedicated and committed to coming so that can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction we had two Chester had one making Georgia had four um Chicago had uh recently so this is happening around the country more than we would like Virginia just had uh two escapes as well so um this is a correlation with the great number of folks in custody and up against a very impacted minimal stat in level for correctional officers so if I understood what you just said that some of this has to do with Staffing levels some of it has to do with Staffing levels and then some of it um is based on uh what we're seeing is just making sure any door that is there should be secured at all times so if it has a lock it follow your policy so all of all of these factors go into how Escape can occur so this is not our first hearing so some of this information is not new to this committee so let me how are we doing on hirings what are what is our current vacancy level uh to dat we have 867 uh uniform vacancies for correction officers that was my last run um and and that was last week I can provide you with the current number and do another run today but the vacancy level we are hiring but not um at the numbers I would like we have experienced incremental increase in our classes where we were averaging 20 to 25 we're averaging 30 to 33 now we just graduated a class uh a week and a half ago we had a class of 30 start on Monday so even though we have continuous classes we need to increase the number of eligible um applicants that uh go ahead are we are we providing incentives for hiring such as bonuses signing bonuses yes we do have the signing bonus we also have uh the signing bonus once you complete the academy you receive another bonus we have an attendance incentive and uh We've increased the um salaries for the correctional officers so we also um have a bonus that we provide to any of our work work force that refers someone who clears the background check uh they can receive a bonus for that referral once the person completes the academy so there is funding uh how much is that bonus for the record it's $500 is that twice once you once you sign and once you complete the training is that two different two different um totaling 500 so it's 250 and 250 we might want to take look at increasing that I'll bring that up to uh member Gilmore Richardson you know as an increased incentive to um get people to take on the corrections officer position let me segue and this will be my last question before I turn it over we had uh previously talked about the locks up at the facility and replacing them where are we on the schedule of replacing uh those uh locks on doors so C FCF full uh replacement of locks so the entirety of the facility has been outfitted with locks RCF all locks have been replaced uh pic we had uh 20 outstanding locks 11 have been uh of that 20 11 have been completed they needed extensive framework so it wasn't just the locking mechanism itself there was some damage to the cell doors that had to be retrofitted so the remainder um at CFCF we completed the 11 we're also uh working on looking at uh the Detention Center we have even though we depopulated it we're uh doing some Renovations at the Detention Center to replace the slider and some of the lock workk there so we can utilize um those cells based on our our senses going up so those sliders will take us some time uh to get because that facility built in the six 60s some of those parts are not available have to be retrofitted or manufactured a new to uh comply with the existing structures so that's our next task but pretty much CFC is complete rcf's complete uh PICC is close with the additional framework and DC is the next will tackle commissioner what was the condition of the locks from the cell that the two inmates escaped from those were brand new locks um they just were uh the door was not properly secured okay um member vau yes would you like to question the commissioner yes um to my understanding there was a a count several counts done uh while in in assisting these people from um with escaping what has been done toate create a checkin balance so that an officer will not be able to falsify documents so what we put in place was reiterating the policy which would have and is sufficient that you have to have a secondary layer for someone to check that count for accuracy so it's not just filling out the paperwork but a sergeant or lieutenant and a captain overseas what is the final count sitting um with that lieutenant to confer is this the accuracy holding and making sure people attest to the accuracy of that not just signing off and then calling it in okay because of the uh low staff uh I understand a new system or new schedule has been put in place how is that operating thus far uh they have a certain amount of days to work and a c certain amount of days off or a longer shift could you explain uh to me exactly what's happening with that uh yes so that is our 223 schedule prior to uh implementing the 223 schedule IND Correctional staff would work six days straight before they received a day off the 223 allows for more of a work life balance two days on two days off three days on and with that schedule we're able to give two weekends off per month before that they had to work six straight days and understanding that we're human beings and this is a challenging job we have to give our staff time to to recuperate to breathe to have time with their family and since um we implemented that the feedback has been positive uh staff are reporting to me personally you know I have more time my wife or spouse has a honeydew list for me and I'm able to make games um so I thought that was the best approach because when you know better you do better and that was my way of saying we have to do things different this work is challenging but working what we call Iron Man hours six days straight um that was a time but now we're in the present and we should be working to do better with scheduling great great um I I think that's a a good idea and it also gives them less exposure to a lot of the things that happen like you know they smoked that K2 in the prison and things like that and it allows people a little more freedom so I I appreciate you for that and also less fatigue because if you're overworked you sometimes cut Corners um so hopefully this will improve that uh situation as well um I guess the last thing I wanted to know you said the door was not locked properly but it was a new lock so is it something the prisoner was able to do to make sure the door didn't get locked properly and has that uh possibility been removed or corrected in some way yes it has so we um when we began the installation of all the lock systemwide um and just you know added the addition to CFC if just because it was the the thing to do we have a video training video that we put out as the correctional officers are securing folks inside their cells we're asking them to as you push and pull to make sure that door and the latch is catching so any obstruction can be recognized um also with the yard door leading out into the recreational yard making sure those doors remain secure cured properly locked at all times when recre Recreation is not in use thank you no further questions Mr chairman you're muted Curtis you're muted of my best comments happen when I'm muted um but thank you for those questions member vaugh um and and for your l are focus on this issue so is it there is no perfect department or operation but I think it's safe to say that you are constantly evaluating and try to make improvements the question I would have uh you mentioned that there were some staff relocations or without talking about disciplinary actions without violating it you you made certain moves based on what your evaluation was uh the the immediate action I took was to transfer the executive leadership um at that time and uh I have since appointed a a warten and another deputy there but as the report is still being finalized um I can't say at this time um what portions I can release uh but it contains private personal and prison security information but once it's finalized um you know I may be able to share that privately because of the sensitivity of uh staff um or Personnel decisions but the immediate was because of the gravity of it it was immediate transfer of the executive leadership team understood and understood uh the Privacy aspect of it are there any uh Mr glass are there any other members that wish to question commissioner Carney yes Mr chairman just for the record I'd like to note that uh council member Thomas is present welcome member Thomas and council member her would like to be recognized for questions member her hello um good morning commissioner uh my my question is actually just about recruitment uh meeting with the the police officials at the Academy and all that stuff that some of the one of the complaints was that while they're getting a certain number of recruits some of them can't pass the phys first initial physical exams uh and they're talking about possibly getting a waiver for them to take those physical tests after they complete the academy when they may be better in shape uh is that something that may are you guys experiencing that kind of stuff too where you're maybe I you said 30 to 33 per class like where you're getting maybe 70 people signing up but only 33 are able to pass the initial uh criteria that thank you for that question the majority of our folks that are not um accepted is because of the background checks and may have a record but we uh since the over a year and a half we've been strategic and and working with Ohr to remove the weight restrictions to say give people an opportunity to um to De demonstrate that they can do it so that hasn't been our challenge uh so we're doing a number of we looked at a number of things so wait we're going to take you if you can pass our test you're in but prior to our making that request if someone went down to uh get their medical clearance and they were overweight then they were just rejected so we no longer have that challenge so we were saying give us let the person uh demonstrate they can do it if they can they're in okay and uh just one think so you said most of them are knocked off because of the criminal record part right yes correct yes okay uh nowadays uh criminal records as long as they're nonviolent a lot of that stuff can be uh can be exposed after five years 10 years uh it's it's actually very simple uh are we giving any of these people that are maybe just on the the the Cuffs nonviolent but got in trouble and uh maybe it is over 5 10 years since they got in trouble and uh we could try to shift them uh to getting their record expunged uh and then reapplying if their record is expunged we've had a few individuals that provided updated information to show that their records were expunged just the case by case basis um they were non felonies and we brought those folks in so we had some folks um during the process they were even taking their driver's exam we more flexibility with that to get them in so we're doing a number of things that we didn't previously do but because this is such a competitive um labor market um we're trying to track people back to corrections as a viable Public Safety you know career we're looking at everything like what are the blocks so anything that I receive as hey this person was um not accepted we look at a case by case and then we work with Central HR to to work with them to get any barriers removed that we can beautiful all right uh commissioner thank you uh appreciate the work you do I know it's not an easy job uh you know uh so thank you no more questions thank you thank you member har appreciate it uh Mr glass anyone else uh Mr chairman I am not seeing any more uh hands raised or questions in the chat I see council member vaugh had questions but I don't know if that was from before or not member vaugh are you okay yes I'm fine thank you okay one other question um there was a apprehension of someone who was on the outside aiding and ab bedding the inmates that escaped is that correct that is correct there was one civilian AC well two civilian accomplices and one in the awaiting vehicle is there anything you can share by way of advanced correspondence through FaceTime through phone calls through visits that could have uh tipped us off that this Escape was being planned uh we do listen to phone calls uh because we did not have for knowledge of it uh in the to get us a chance to say these individuals listen to We we record phone calls we have Intel so unfortunately uh there were no indicators um at the at that time where I can say and I can't share much more but we are utilizing Intel we're using uh phone calls recordings visits um because we have the capab but when something's on our radar we are able to pick it up but as a general course never mind I retract that question um all right thank you very much for your testimony there are no other questions for the commissioner Mr glass can you bring up the next panel yes Mr chairman our next panel will be district attorney Larry gr Mr district attorney how are you I'm very well well chairman thank you um first of all I want to I want to introduce Brett cosian a very talented qualified assistant district attorney who has been pouring over the evidence and information we have in relation to this prison assault I'm sorry prison escape and who is going to be prosecuting it um I'll have a couple more comments we do have a couple of photographs we have a little bit of video to show you uh and I have an invitation which I think is very important for those of you who are in government who are deeply concerned about what has been occurring in the prisons I want you to know that I will be extending an invitation not for this short 15minute presentation but for the two two and a half hour version where everything that uh we are able to show you uh will be shown it's quite a bit of video it's quite a bit of audio and I think it sheds a lot of light on the situation that we Face here let me just start out by saying preliminarily as someone who spent more than a year of my life going into um going into prisons and jails as part of my job I went into the current fold correctional facility probably a thousand times but certainly uh more than a hundred times um and I would like to remind everyone that the name is current fold for a reason and that is that Warden Curran Deputy Warden fold were murdered and they were murdered in a prison riot and they were murdered in a prison riot that occurred at holmesburg prison in 19 19 73 that was a very very dark and disturbing period in the United States it came only two years after the prison riot and uh everything that flowed around it that happened in Atta New York for those of you who have forgotten the prison riot in Attica New York resulted in 43 deaths 43 men killed 33 of them inmates 10 of them correctional officers they died not in the way you might expect but that is a discussion for another day um I think we all share a deep and abiding concern for the safety of anyone who works in a correctional facility and the safety of anyone who is an inmate in a correctional facility and the safety of everyone else in the community and we should we should because there is work to be done having said that um I do want to give a special greeting to all those members of council who are here today today uh because I appreciate your interest and concern about this I I mentioned to council member vaugh a few months ago that we had an ongoing investigation in the case we did we do now uh that we would have more information today we do have more information today but when we have two and a half hours of important information some of which is appropriate to spread on the public record some of which is more appropriate so that we do not facilitate any sort of additional problems to do so privately it would be my wish that uh all of you chairman Jones council member Sharon vaugh who was kind enough to initiate these proceedings uh Vice chair kinata Johnson council member Thomas council member Kendra Brooks council member her and that all of your colleagues would take the opportunity as soon as you are available to come to my office where we will not only present uh nearly all the information we have everything we're allowed to present to you but we will give you some of the we'll have some of the harder conversations that can't necessarily happen in 15 minutes and cannot happen right here you should also know that that presentation looks like about 30 to 35 different pieces of video and audio photography and other pieces of evidence in this short presentation we're only going to be able to present two or three although I think that those um three items will have their impact and will uh no doubt remind you of why I have this very serious concerned that we all work together that we avoid the blame game because we cannot have Attica here and we cannot have another holmesburg prison riot here our investigation around this case arose in the context of a few years of seeing some very negative things occur in the Philadelphia prisons and I do not say that to point at anyone I'm pointing at no one except all of us who should work together to fix it but those situations included things like a period of time when there were no ion visits yet we had uh a series of fatal overdoses on drugs that were occurring within the correctional facility which means we know they weren't coming in from the visitors of inmates who were civilians they were coming from Personnel of some sort not necessarily correctional officers we had a prosecution involving brutality that occurred in the in the prison where we had video of a correctional officer breaking the law we have had uh prosecutions that have involved investigation of very large numbers of Contraband cell phones and in case you thought the Contraband cell phones were no big deal oh yes they are uh we have one case involving a defendant with multiple murders who was found to have even more cell phones than he had criminal cases and had scratched the names of his victims into the wall of a cell we have had a case in which a correction not a correctional officer excuse me we have had a case in which someone who was involved with Food Services worked with an inmate a guy who was running a drug corner and by the time they were done with his Contraband cell phone there had been an exchange of money through the phone for the purchase and distribution of an AR-15 assault rifle on the street all right so before this Escape ever occurred we all knew that there were issues that were occurring and once again I point a finger at no one other than to say that this is something we need to work together on the final P piece of information that I think a lot of us had was that a murder had occurred on the grounds of the prisons that someone had waited outside for a person that for whatever reason he believed would be released and that person murdered somebody not his Target actually but murdered the wrong person misidentified the person the murderer in that case is named Amin Hurst okay the murderer in that case is Amin Hurst the instigator the main person in this Escape is Amin Hurst that is what we're talking about we're not just talking about The Escape of someone who was arguably among the very most dangerous people in the prison he had four open homicides he had two open gunpoint robberies we're talking about someone who was literally charged with murdering somebody on Prison grounds and very close to where he was held in the pick so so I say that to say that I I you know from the bottom of my heart I invite the mayor I invite the next mayor the day after election day or as soon as we can figure it out I invite Council to get together with us so that we can be transparent and show you almost everything we have so you can work deeply on these issues now having said that I also got to give a huge thank you to Diana Cortez our our um city solicitor without her intervention because of extremist issues with video up at the prisons it is very likely we never would have gotten the video that we have but she went to the wall to make sure that there was transparency here before things were raced over and in ways so that we could obtain video one of the crucial issues that is revealed by our investigation is that the video system at the at the prisons has been so dysfunctional that number one for the most part it is not monitored live no one's watching and number two for the most part you can't find the video you need you can't go get it the whole system will shut down obviously that's an issue uh that needs to be addressed I'm very encouraged to hear that the commissioner is talking about addressing it but we are potent we're not necessarily talking about putting a bandage on a problem we might be talking about a complete replacement of that among other technological systems that present pretty serious issues all right so let me try to see what I can do to cover some ground here I can tell you this you know generally our job is is to prosecute Criminal activi it's not to weigh in on whether something could be done better as a system or at least it's not our main activity but obviously the prisons are a part of what we work on every day so our comments here for the benefit of a group of people and I assume everybody on this call is in that group who want to who want to do better may go beyond what is criminal and go on into some things that are just systemic problems call it negligence call it malfeasance call it whatever you want I'm not here to say EX actly what's criminal or not we have already charged six people in this escape the two escapes and four other individuals we may or may not charge additional people but we are here to talk about a problem so we don't have an Attica so we don't have another current or another fold losing their lives in um in the disorder that obviously we all want to try to work together to address issue number one obviously is an issue around lack of Staffing I think that there has been much discussion around that um if I may respectfully suggest some questions and some inquiries that Council may wish to pursue uh because we you know we do talk to law enforcement all the time we hear a lot of things from people who don't necessarily want their names out there but one of the things that I have heard in general around law enforcement and I'm not saying it specific to the prisons is that people apply for jobs and often the list for their applicability is extremely delayed you know I I have heard some information about massive expenditures to advertise and attract applicants but if those applicants who are interested in being let's say a police officer or correctional officer apply and they're not put on a list for 18 months or for 12 months then they will all the employable ones will have another job on the other hand if there is a way to extremely quickly turn around these applications and make a thumbs up or a thumbs down hopefully with cooperation of everybody including the involved unions in the Civil Service process then you may have far more success than simply advertising a job for people who can't afford to be unemployed for the period of time it it takes for the list to show up um I will say that we know that uh based on information we have there's a budgeted 1,719 correctional officer positions 967 of them are sworn you're looking at absentee rates despite some positive news inframarginal positive news you're looking at some vacancy rates that are close to 40% and there's no question that staffing issues relate to the Escape itself do you want to show the photo at this time sure all right we have a couple photos in a video we'll show you the video at the end which is actually video of the two escapees that would be Amin Hurst and Nasir Grant uh sneaking across the tile floor of the correctional facility to make their way outside we'll show you that in a moment okay so this is a still photograph that relates to the video will show a little bit later what you see there is a period of time when everybody's supposed to be in their cell um and yet you have an inmate and a white T-shirt with what looked like black basketball shorts and Sliders who is walking around that is not one of the escapees that is in our opinion the lookout and so that you understand video indicates that at a time when people are supposed to be locked up and there is supposed to be a guard who is sitting at the booth there that says stay behind line the guard is not there there is a guard who is inside of the tinted glass just above the booth that says stay behind the line and the what this Lookout is doing he has gone from cell to cell where the inmates are incarcerated he's had a long conversation of some sort with both escapes before they open the doors of themselves themselves but what he does as he is allowed to ambulate within the prisons at this time is he keeps an eye on the guard who is inside the tinted window and who has uh as I understand it three different locations to watch so when he sees the guard looking the other direction the escapes can can sneak out if you look at where the gentleman in the white T-shirt shirt is staring he is looking at an opening in the wall there and if you look down at the floor you'll see one of the escapes who is actually crawling through that door right now uh with the assistance of the lookout we'll show you that video in a little bit but this inom itself show shows multiple problems one problem being that the guard who should be in that booth that says stay behind the line isn't there has left a shift apparently a second shift that is Apparently after about 4 hours hours rather than completing the 8 hour shift um likewise you are then left with one guard who's inside of that tinted area who's responsible for looking at three different directions and then obviously there are some issues to inquire about when you have an inmate um whose name is Jose Flores wera Mr wera was in jail for murder for a beating death a first-degree murder and yet he is in the video that we'll show you and in this photograph walking around the prison engaging with people within their cells apparently carrying bags of water and things like that to the cells while the uh prison is operating in terms of the external infrastructure I know there's been some commentary um about the fact that there were two sensor poles that were removed and they were removed because they did not work but I think it is important as uh this body tries to figure more of what's going on to know that there's a longer history there the longer history is that there are a series of fences that you have to get through in order to escape this the photograph that is up now is actually a photograph that shows the two sensor poles they are within the Cyclone fencing there if you look down from the Garment that is hanging from the razor wire wire you'll see one of those two sensor poles those sensor poles were there to determine DET whether there was anything running around inside of that area that area is known as a dog run because many years ago there was a dog that ran up and down in there for reasons I cannot you know I cannot validate or or I can't swear to the dog was removed and was replaced with these poles these poles are supposed to sense anyone who's in the area my understanding is they work by microwave but here's the kicker So for anybody who's been up there you'll know there are a lot of Canada geek that fly around well over a decade ago probably 15 to 20 years ago the Canada geese in the absence of a dog were Landing in the dog run and when they landed in the dog run they were setting off the sensors and when they were setting off the sensors eventually someone decided to turn them off they have been turned off for more than a decade okay the escapes here managed to make their way out of the prison in 90 seconds from the time they popped open their own doors they made their way out of the prison in 90 seconds they made their way under or through a preut portion of the fence and we'll get that but they were in that dog run this is a photograph of the fence itself cut well in advance of the Escape itself if I recall correctly it was about six weeks is that right Mr Kian seven weeks it's about s weeks before the escape this was cut and we have video indicating that um prison Personnel actually were aware of this four days before the Escape because there's videos showing them out looking at it pointing at it doing you know indicating an awareness of what occurred here with this piece of the fence 90 seconds to get out of prison through that hole fairly quickly but they were stuck in that dog run for 30 minutes with with no dog and no sensors and it is correct that they climbed the sensor Pole to make their way out of the dog run so while I I totally understand that the removal of those poles uh is one aspect of the problem um obviously there's a lot more to do than simply remove the poles when we have a situation where there could could be and should be monitoring occurring in there um if we move on to issues around employee malfeasance uh around dysfunction and failure and once again I'm not pointing at anybody I don't think that does us any good I think we need to to get all the facts and figure everything out before we're ready to say exactly who is responsible for what but I think you should know that we know the Escape occurred during a 4-Hour Gap the correctional officer who should have been at the location I indicated before that booth left a second shift had been held over to a second shift left after 4 hours there was no relief there the Escape occurs when the relief finally shows up that relief goes to sleep we have the video indicating the relief went and sat in a chair and essentially slept when it comes time to do the count and I think this is an important thing to note because we're all aware that the Escape itself was not something that was observed through the cameras that were essentially not going to serve that function um it's not something that was observed initially through a count there were multiple counts that occurred after the Escape that said nobody's missing right the way that this actually came to people people's attention was there was some chatting going on among inmates that was overheard or maybe deliberately disclosed to a correctional officer many hours after to the escape and then that correctional officer started asking questions so what I am telling you in no uncertain terms is that the correctional officer who came in after a 4-Hour Gap produced at least either that correctional officer or that one and subsequent ones produced at least three incorrect counts we know for a fact that correctional officer did not go check the doors to see who was anywhere and seems to have interrupted her sleep only long enough to go over and punch in the prior number the prior count number and send it along okay account is supposed to be a account is not supposed to be a nap followed by falsely asserting a number you never count it but unfortunately that is what we see when we look at that um I think that highlights for you some of the most Salient issues that we have to that that need require inquir inquiry a lack of Staffing external infrastructure issues which are broader than what I mentioned the security video issue is crucial and I'm going to get to that in the context of the video we're about to show you and then there's some internal non-v video infrastructure issues as well U it is it is our purpose to work closely with everyone in government to make sure we have safety inside and outside of these prisons but I want you to note something as we show you this final video which is the video of the Escape it's not the entire video of the Escape it's not going to show you right now in this public situation how it is that those inmates manipulated the doors but we know we have that video and it is my sincere hope that those in government who have a keen interest in this will come to our office and allow us to show you that video as well but it will start with these two inmates who will be on the right side of your screen pushing their doors open never mind how it is they need to do that but pushing their do doors open and it will then uh proceed to show you that they have no fear whatsoever of being on video there's cameras all over they know those cameras are not being watched or they wouldn't have done it this way they know that if if the camera contents or the substance of the video are ever going to be obtained it's going to be long after they're out of custody and frankly they were almost not obtained at all due to the extreme problems with the uh video technology that have existed at the prison at this time I'm going to ask Ada zakoian to show you this brief section of video certainly and if I could just uh set this up for the council members good morning it's very nice to speak to you about uh this unfortunately under the circumstances that we're in but uh the section that you see right here is what we call the bottom tier of the H1 unit at the Philadelphia industrial Correctional Center um the two cells that are in question are going to be immediately on your right there cells number five and six um what you are then going to see after that is a view that goes the other direction and it's going to be going towards the correctional officer booth and what they call the auxiliary bubble that the district attorney referred to that's that uh black glass panel that is uh back there where a single correctional officer looks towards three different units uh the view that's going to follow after that is a larger view of the day room where you're going to be able to see um not only the day room area but also the area in which uh Mr Hurst and Mr Grant hid while awaiting a signal from Mr Flores where to that they were able to uh sneak out into the yard which by the way has a wide open and unlocked door at that time and then they were a the last view that you'll see is uh the H1 yard area where you'll be able to see these two inmates run across and get through the hole that the district attorney previously showed you in that fence so with that I'm going to go ahead and just let this play without comment is the open door all right well that is the video itself um obviously I just want to reiterate again my invitation to to all relevant people in government to come to the office we will accommodate you every way and every way you want to come today come on down you want to come tomorrow we will find a way I I don't care what the day is this is I think there's an urgency that we all feel and uh to the extent we can facilitate that we certainly want to do it both before and after election day having said that we are um we are very happy to answer any questions to the extent we are able well thank you Mr district attorney um there is to say to leis a lot to unpack there um I see a mechanical and Personnel failures uh in in in tremendous proportions um we will take you up on the extended version of the review of photos footage and other uh information that you are willing to share I'd like to also extend that invitation uh to the current Administration but to the two uh proposed uh 100th mayor candidates to attend that as well because at the end of the day what we don't want to do and I think you said it in the beginning is to not learn from these mistakes and I know at this point in time this Administration is working on a transition report and if if nothing else these kinds of uh facts that were found on the mechanical end on the Personnel end need to be a part of a trans report so that the 100th mayor uh stands on the shoulders of this administration's um corrective actions and and needs assessments that have to be done for the safety of those who we have in custody for the safety of those professionals uh that work within the institution and for those people uh that are in the the general public that person crime was committed uh one of them the homicides in my district so I know um up close and personal and you've been involved with this how disconcerting that could be the potential witnesses to his case that individual escaped uh and was gone for an extended period of time so for the safety of the public for the safety of professionals Andy for the safety of the inmates we will take you up on uh that meeting and extend that invitation to those uh individuals seeking to be the next mayor and inclusive of this Administration so that we give a warm handoff and correction action steps uh that can ensue um I guess what I would thank you for is the extensive investigation that you've done and I'm assuming that with that will come recommendations on how to I know that's not your wheelhouse but I think based on your investigation there might be information that might be useful on how to take corrective steps yes sir 100% I can tell you that the chief of our special investigations unit Leandra Raco and Brett sosian have dug in deep on this one they have a lot of information uh we have been given uh excellent access by commissioner Carney here and we have had tremendous cooperation from the city to try to obtain this we have also I should tell you consulted with a prison expert because we want to make sure that we understand what what is possible in terms of improvement of this situation and we are more than happy to share everything we can in relation to that report so we're going to take you up on that I'm going um find a date that is conducive for the majority of the members of this committee uh uh to be a part of it and any other members and uh staffers from the administration that would like to be a part of it we will we will take you up on that Mr district attorney thank you sir chairman may I say this too if you need to do it in in a couple batches we'll we'll work with you whatever we got to do if you have to do it in three separate sessions we will work with you to make sure that it can happen it does have to happen at our office just for reasons related to the security of the items involved um just because you know electronic transmission of things that can't get out just yet is always unwise but we are delighted to work with you on that when I when I think about and I know commissioner Carney is on top of this as we relate to um particular uh Mal possibilities that she can't talk about uh because they're ongoing cases I get that but whenever there's Communications within the prison um phones and things like that that puts everyone in danger in the community and so I'm I'm I'm certain uh that she's on top of that and she will share that offline possibly of what steps are being taken but um are there uh Mr glass any questions from members of the committee yes Mr chairman council member vaugh would like to be recognized member vaugh yes uh Mr da I want to thank you for your due diligence and um getting just a little bit of the information out to us today and you and I did discuss having uh this meeting further uh reviewed in a private setting um commissioner let us help you you know um it's obvious there are some serious uh malfunctions and things that need to be addressed in Philadelphia prisons um unfortunately I will not be here for the next next Administration but please get with um our chairman on Public Safety whoever if uh if it's Curtis or a councilman Jones or if it changes get in their ear ask them for the resources that you need to help you do your job better because there is nothing more important than keeping your team and our city safe at this point criminals have no respect as we can see for the um the rules and the laws that we try to live by so I'm hope I'm hoping that um this Council body and the future one will give you in the next budget the resources that you need to make sure that your prisons are secure that your staff is safe when they come to work because I'm sure that's an issue as well some folks don't want to apply because they're afraid of the situations in the prisons um but I thank you all for being a part of this hearing and I and and I pushed it because I wanted to get some information out as a followup for our first hearing um did not know that the case was still ongoing but as uh we discussed in the last hearing we we would you know finalize it as soon as possible I have less than a month in my position but I want everyone to understand the urgency of making sure that your financial needs are met to keep your facility staff as well as updating your video camera system to make sure sure that things like this are caught and um in a timely fashion you know if that means having a staff person watch it daily and and more importantly I'm sure that the the officer that came to work was probably getting some overtime and fatigued so unfortunately she he or she did fall asleep at the will allowing this to happen but we don't want that to uh occur again if possible we want you to make sure make sure you get the staff that you need and the resources that you need thank you very much thank you member Von and um there's a saying that we spend 1% of our time worried about the mouse in our house the mouse spends 99% of his time wearing where we are and it was obvious that they had paid particular attention to the comings and goings and ongoing operations of our professionals uh at at the facility we um have to have redundant systems whether it's technology whether it's human capital um constantly overlapping so that they are not as familiar with our systems as as they have proven uh they are so um again um echoing member vaugh let us help you and we are we are here for that uh Mr glass is there anyone else who wants to question the district attorney yes Mr chairman councilman Harry would like to be recognized member har well chairman uh district attorney kler uh you said that the the video was bad and the system doesn't work uh because it's not interacting the way it should in in your opinion just in general say if I'm still here the C chairman you're still on uh oh boy the camera system uh for the prison you're saying is it doesn't work the way it should be what's your opinion on the camera system for the city in general the cameras that we have out on the street because there's a lot of cameras but I don't I don't necessarily know if they're working right or if there's a if they're being monitored right uh how what is your because you get to look at these videos while you're doing your cases probably more than anybody uh what's your opinion of the video system in general that we're using um thank you for the question council member always good to see you uh so first of all my my opinion is that the camera system that has that SEPTA has um is excellent and in many ways I think should be regarded at least in Philadelphia is the gold standard for how much good can be done when you have cameras that are not only up to-date uh and monitored and recoverable but you have them in many many different locations I cannot tell you the number of homicide cases we have where it's actually a camera that's on a bus and the camera happens to drive by a regular stop and there happen to be people walking down the street in distinctive clothing shortly before you know a shooting occurs you may not even have the shooting on video but that kind of um highdef video is absolutely crucial I could explain to you other cases where uh the forensic unit at crime scene has been able to go and take a palm print off of a piece of Steel because the the high definition camera was so good that I could show this unknown killer sticking his hand down on a particular bench and that enabled people to come behind it so the good news is if we look for example at the SEPTA system it's up to-date it's high definition it's excellent it does a lot of good and you know whenever we hear sepa video we're always optimistic um the not as good news is that there certainly are a significant number of cameras in Philadelphia and I don't think it's just Philadelphia but there's significant number of other cameras that either not are not functioning or they are functioning in a way so that they sweep from one side to another uh and the timing of the sweep is not particularly helpful or the the visibility is blocked by su glare or the definition is so grainy that yes you can see you know the silhouette of a small person on the screen approaching another person you can see you know a crooked Arm coming out you can see the other person falling down but in terms of being able to see the things that PPD needs to investigate such as you know rust on the fender of a car or the license plate number or the distinctive markings on a pair of sweatpants uh or the type of shoes in terms of that the camera fails us it's absolutely better than nothing but it ain't perfect um I will finally say that you know I'm I'm a huge believer that investment in technology forensic technology including camera technology is extremely important we do want to catch people who commit terrible crimes we do not want to put innocent people in jail in their place I think it's extremely important it's been something that we have emphasized um but I also want you to know that you know as an aspect of our gun violence task force Statewide Grant we have been able to obtain some new cameras uh which and we collaborate in working around those cameras with the divic and with the Philadelphia Police Department uh you know I believe that the police department wants to be a solid partner uh and collaborate I believe they want better highdef cameras I believe uh you know I believe if we can find the money and obviously money is always an issue but if we can find the money it is uh essential and Urgent at the prisons it is also important in general in Philadelphia thank you for that that was good thank you so much thank you council member thank you member har um on the camera aspect one of the failures obviously um within that technology that those motion detectors should be synchronized to an alert that kind of goes off in particular when there are spaces where there should not be unauthorized movement and so that sinking of a camera motion detector and alarm has to be assessed those are things that we can kind of drill down on and work on and I'm not uh expert on that technology but I've got to believe increasing those kinds of redundancies will help the other thing is that um couldn't we have cameras that have SE secondary within the facility commissioner um secondary viewers so that if in fact someone failed or fell asleep or whatever had to go to the restroom there's a second set of eyes in what is called a a uh route for the cameras to be able to kick in to be a second kind of fail safe on viewing those cameras is that possible the technology that's available um that we're looking at we need a centralized camera system that where every camera talks there's motion uh sensor technology we're close to um Implement well entering into a contract for radio frequency ID arm bands for the population that will allow us to through that arm band in real time um under identify where folks are so definitely centralized uh camera you do need we will need 24hour uh dedicated staff to do just that motion detectors um in addition to your uh uniform staff all of these Technologies we're going to be work well we are working with uh public property um excuse me capital projects to get this underway our camera infrastructure is over 25 plus years old um it doesn't give us the the the the real time capability to pull video was extensive hours taken um to to pull that video we worked uh hands inand with the District Attorney's office to provide but it was a painstaking process and when I say painstaking process the Clock Was ticking so uh we we definitely will have to have a overall you'll have to have cloud-based space um dedicated infrastructure to maintain just volumes uh video that is recorded so there are so many things that we're looking at but they the goal here is you have to integrate your system have 24-hour monitoring and use the technology that's available um so we're working on that now uh of course hindsight is 2020 we were working on um that the RFID uh we're closer than we than we uh have been and that process that I want in place is that that will help with accounts accountability so if you have this armband on I should see that Jan if there is an incident you were in the vicinity coupled with the um video that you can laser in the an equated is you get the fish bowl and it's there but there's technology where you can laser in and look at the serial number on the dollar bill and so we have some of that um newer Technologies at RCF um n CFCF but it has to be systemwide so we'll be working to integrate our camera um unified system I'm glad to hear that I don't want to go in and take too deep a dive into one aspect of it we need to have a a a longer conversation and meetings about it but one I will take of the parking um garages actually now utilize a camera system that where individuals aren't even on pres on on premises they're in different parts of the city or even not in the city at all and they're utilizing uh veterans disabled veter veterans to be able to monitor those cameras in a way um that is uh a force multiplier for the boots on the ground within your facility but that's just a discussion for another day uh Mr glass are there any other members who want to ask questions uh Mr chairman I don't see any more members wishing to be recognized in the chat or have their hand raised member V you okay yes I am I am very satisfied with the information that we got from the district attorney as well as the commissioner and I just uh want to reiterate again that this was not a Witch Hunt this was basically a way for us to see how we can make things better within the system as well as um like I said earlier help the commissioner um make those facilities more secure and just get an explanation of how it happen and it it's obvious that things are severely outdated and that major resources are going to be needed in order to correct these problems and um I like the idea that you made about maybe increasing the incentive for people to take those jobs and I strongly believe once we get a system or um update the technology that more people will feel um interested or show interest in taking these jobs because they will feel safer when they report to work no one wants to go anywhere where there's a possibility that they they may not return home um you know we all just want to make a living so that we can get back to our families and loved ones I thank you all for taking the time I thank all my other Council colleagues for being on this hearing and I hope you all take us up on going to the DA's office and seeing um all the footage that he has to offer us so that we can gain knowledge and so that you all can do your jobs better in helping commissioner Carney get what she needs in order to make the necessary changes thank you everyone thank you member Von Mr glass um who is the next do we have any other panels to testify Mr chairman councilman har would like to be recognized member her I think you're on mute sir got it this is a just a general in general question since you know us on Council we're looking at different ways that maybe we could help with the law enforcement uh just would like to have your opinions on drones both you and and doing uh a in fighting crime or be in monitoring the prison so uh we would work with PPD uh drones are another tool that we can utilize to hover over our 25 acre campus um anywhere there's a camera uh a PPD camera uh that would help to have that drone and that is a good detection and it would have to you know infared technology movement if it's a if it's moving it should pick it up so we would look forward to working with p uh P PPD all these acronyms on that so open to that as well and that'll help again if we working as a city to combat this that we're not a standalone Department it really does go a long way so yes we're open to that and very helpful for that tool um simply put yes facts are good truth is good science is good getting it right is good whether that particular solution is the best one for the prisons I would defer to The Experts um but it certainly might be and I would also say that as I mentioned before we have engaged an expert to take a look and to inform us because let's be honest it's not our area of expertise um and we will be happy to share that in private session as well yeah I I thank you for that and uh I'm looking at it too because I I know there's been some problems with it in places where they all already have it like Seattle and and California and New York uh with some lawsuits over privacy issues uh you know I I think if it was done right it it would be a help but I I do think we also have to worry about you know whose rights were violating uh with the with the drones uh but in the prisons you know that I believe that would probably be a help uh there uh I'm still looking at how it that's why want your opinion still looking at how it would be as an actual policing tool so thank you yeah council member just one final comment obviously VI ly the Privacy under the law the privacy concerns are much less at a prison and a jail as they would be in a residential neighborhood um so that's something we can certainly discuss further thank you thank you member har um with uh with that being said thank you for your testimony it was enlightening and it illustrate you know when you go to the doctor's office you get an examination you know there's a degree of uncomfortableness when you when you get the examination but that's all a part of assessing what's wrong so that you can get better and we can get better so that's that's what we're doing and um with that thank you for your testimony appreciate you Mr glass who do we have any others to testify Mr chairman we have no more panels to testify and we are ready to move into public comment okay um and who do we we have for public comment Mr chairman our first witness or individual for public comment is Kate Mackey are you connected okay smackie are you there

facilitating positive change and providing essential support to the individuals under our care witnessing daily Transformations we firmly believe in the possibility of Rehabilitation and Improvement however the current Staffing crisis has significantly impacted our ability to provide services to the incarcerated individuals this not only affects our clients but also has wider implications for the entire city the presence of treatment staff in critical situations within the prisons has historically fostered a sense of stability regrettably due to the current situation our capacity to deliver essential Services has been compromised we rely heavily on sufficient s security Staffing for members of local 159 to ensure the seamless execution of our responsibilities in the absence of adequate security Staffing levels Court mandated Services crisis counseling and educational programs are at risk of disruption the consequences of the security Staffing crisis has been publicly acknowledged but there is also a staffing crisis in regards to treatment staff in 2011 there were approximately 100 social workers catering to the incarcerated population today this number has dwindled to a near 40 there are only three psychologists providing services to the incarcerated population on State Road the failure to fill these crucial vacancies directly affects the individual ual awaiting substance abuse programs Court mandated violence prevention initiatives and GED preparation courses members of local 2187 are Resolute in their daily efforts to facilitate the successful reintegration of incarcerated persons into society as productive citizens of the city of Philadelphia our services play a pivotal role in reducing recidivism rates enhancing Public Safety reuniting families and

to Mayor Bowser to watch more videos: http://bit.ly/2mmLN5b For Press Releases and News in the ...", "video_transcript": "this HBCU Public Service leadership program uh is uh important because we know that there are a lot of students who are interested in starting a career in public service and just like myself when I came to Washington DC I won't say how many years but many years ago um I I knew that uh there's a special place for people like me uh in state and local government and so now it's time for us to welcome the next generation of leaders so choosing the HBCU was a really easy experience I was immersed in HBCU culture since birth my parents were both graduates from North Carolina Central University and a lot of what I learned about life in college was from my experiences with my parents I wanted to start a legacy at an institution that not only prioritized an education which was something that was so valuable to me but also prioritize the community from which I came it was really really important for me to connect with my culture as a person of African descent as a person of Hispanic heritage to focus on Black Culture uh the the emphasis on uh learning more about black history and so that was a the initial pull factor so one of the major things that I learned while attending an HBCU was the importance of critical thinking it was a excellent training ground for my experience here in DC government because it allowed me to work with a diverse group of individuals I learned a lot of leadership skills I was sgaa President I was president of every one of my classes at North Carolina Central really and truly how to hustle I mean you learn really how to grind out of HBCU and that really sets you up for a professional life being a native Washingtonian um attending DC public schools I always wanted to go to college and come back and serve my community I absolutely love to serve I say all the time the highest form of leadership is service and working in DC allows me to touch residents firsthand and see the actual impact of the work that we do um when I saw mayor Bowser um become elected for mayor I was like man I want to be a part of that team the rich history that we have as African-Americans in this country it's because folks pave the way and they really ingrain that sense of purpose uh into my being so I serve now with the understanding that I have responsibility to pay it forward people work really hard for me to be in a position that I'm in and now it's my responsibility to make sure the Next Generation has these same opportunities

from Howard and the Howard students uh who are in the house so this is a wonderful meeting of the Firebirds and bison uh to kick off HBC our HBCU Public Service program which I announced just a few uh weeks ago it is the first of its kind in the nation uh I want to acknowledge and thank our teams in DC government who have been so instrumental in kicking off this program uh let me start with the director of the Department of Employment Services which is our department of labor director unique Morris Hughes I want to thank uh Deputy Mayor Paul K who is right here thank you Deputy Mayor Paul k for your leadership and our education and Workforce um PR programs because we know uh that the city that we're building a prosperous city a city that is focused on opportunity across all eight Wards building Talent is our number one calling um because we want all of our residents to be able to participate in a prosperous uh DC and wherever I go in the city I see talented people we have no shortage of talent um and we want to make sure that the skills building starting from prek-3 all the way through UDC and on the UDC Law or whatever graduate program you want to be in uh is focused on you getting a great job starting a business so you can raise your families right here in the district of Colombia and so through the HBCU Public Service program we are going to it says bring some of the best and brightest but we're going to continue to bring the best and brightest graduating students from HBCU to DC government right so as you can see by the excellent video uh that Dr Morris

going to be 25 students uh and those 25 students will have the opportunity to be match with a great job in DC government uh and as a person who's in charge of the 37,000 people who work for us I know how exciting this opportunity uh is and for your parents it's also exciting right because it may mean that before you graduate you already have a job right that's good uh and I frequently also say because we recognize that we're competing for your talent because the truth is a lot of people are going to want you and so I see it as my job to make sure that you have the opportunity before you graduate and start getting all these offers that you see DC government as a first choice and here's why you should see it that way uh we're in local government and in local government in DC you could go to the feds you could go to think tanks you can go to a lot of places that do public policy uh but you won't have the immediate impact that you can have in local government uh I tell folks if you like politics if you like people um if you like to mix it up a little bit you like public policy but more than that uh you want to change communities one block at a time the place you go is local government in DC in particular so a little bit different some I complain a lot about our lack of statehood and it is really a travesty of our American democracy but one thing that we have that other cities don't have is we're City County State School District all at once and we're pretty flat it's me and 13 council members uh that decide how we use20 billion do and is our 70 person cabinet who really executes on our priorities uh and that allows us to do some pretty amazing things like this HBCU program that you know came together pretty quickly we're funding it because Dr Morris Hughes has figured out a way to do it and then she'll tell me what else she needs uh and then I'm GNA tell the directors that we're going to make it a priority and guess what it's done and so that's how we get things done and that is why working in local government is so exciting people ask me all the time you know what are you going to do this what are you going to have this browser what are you going to I was like first of all I'm mayor and I'm mayor right now and second of all I have the best job in Washington this is my hometown this is what I love to do and I get to work with some pretty outstanding people and we want to challenge you to think about the big problems of our age um and I think uh HBCU in many ways are by definition Mission oriented on how to advance black excellence and we have uh a task uh in many parts of our society to make sure that we're more Equitable that everybody gets a fair shot whether it's from closing wealth gaps um or making sure that people can have healthy babies and aren't dealing with disparities at hospitals to having access to entrepreneurial opportunities that they have been locked out from for decades because of the structure of our society so the these this is our task and this is our calling so we're proud um at at this stage to have our focus on attracting the best of the best from HBCU formalized in DC government uh and invite you uh to not only be a part of it but to tell other people about about it because we want you here working for us uh and so with that I have the opportunity Now to turn over to who's going to come after me to Dr Morris Hughes as I present uh our DC apprenticeship week and I'll just um say a little more about it this year marks the unique the the 19th annual National apprenticeship re um in recognition of the vital role apprenticeships play and the vital role employers play in Training the next generation of Public Service leaders the well-being and economic uh stability of skilled workers in the district depends upon the availability of opportunities to develop and Advance um in critical Fields the expansion of the apprenticeship program enhances employment opportunities boosts wages and better enables employers to meet their staffing needs apprenticeships continue to evolve to include traditional careers in building and trade Industries non-traditional Industries including Hospitality it and Public Safety apprenticeships provide the opportunity to earn an income while receiving on the job training so whereas the District of Colombia's robust apprenticeship system with over 330 programs can provide tangible value to both employers and imprint es through increased productivity improved diversity and inclusion uh to fulfilling careers for job Seekers so I declare this week DC Apprentice week in Washington DC thank you and with that I would like to invite our host and our new president who I must say has just brought a tremendous amount of energy uh to the job who has hit

couldn't be more aligned with what we're trying to do at Howard University our core values fostering excellence and Leadership truth and service they are footprints in this program an overwhelming number of of our students come to our campus they've already developed a disposition to serve you can see this almost every day at Howard University you can see it at our day of service that kicks off our Academic Year you can see it in the number of underclassmen who are applying uh to our our alternative spring break program which um some people forfeit their their normal break to go out in the country and in the nation to serve countless other students come to the mecca unsure of their life's purpose only to discover that purpose as they Journey Through the institution all of this helps explain why anticipation for this apprenticeship program is already extremely high at Howard University we already have several graduating seniors and Dr Edington I'm pretty sure that you you probably know yours as well who are primed and ready uh to to begin this particular program they are absolutely perfect for this opportunity students with a heart for service with a heart for the District of Colombia who are currently in the midst of figuring out what's next for them postgraduation this program this HBCU public service service program is tailor made for these students now throughout my experiences in in working with students in higher education sometimes it's the students who have a strong desire to work in public service who sometimes have the toughest time finding suitable employment after they graduate but this program with 25 new apprentices with a direct pipeline to employment in DC government this helps rectify the issue and we expect that this just this is just the beginning there is more here more in DC and hopefully all across the country as this program becomes an emblem for others that may rise so as we develop our program and determine the best practices for making it a lasting success I am confident in saying that all of us are more than than happy to be collaborating not just with UDC but hopefully we can take this and collaborate with other hbcus and delivering these types of opportunities in other cities throughout the country in closing let me say I am sincerely happy to be in this moment as we formly unveiled this groundbreaking project and

GREG GONZALES, MICHAEL HEILEMANN (HI-LA-MAN), AND DR. STEVEN LOME SET OUT ON THE ROUTE. (GREG GONZALES) 07.48 I FELT REALLY WELL. NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER. 50 GONZALES GETS TO MILE THREE... (GREG) 09.11 I GO, OH MY GOSH, TEN MORE TO GO. NO PROBLEM. LAST THING I REMEMBERED. 14 (DR. LOME) 00.59 I SAW A RUNNER COLLAPSE. 00 DR. LOME...A CHOMP CARDIOLOGIST...HAPPENS TO BE STEPS BEHIND HIM. (DR. LOME) 01.11 THERE WAS NO PULSE AND HE WASN'T BREATHING. AND I THOUGHT, OH MY GOSH, FULL CARDIAC ARREST. 15 HE STARTS C-P-R.. UNBELIEVABLY HIS \u00e1FIRST TIME DOING IT.. OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL.

AND WE'RE SAYING THAT WE WERE HOPING THAT HE WAS OKAY. AND AS WE WENT, YOU KNOW, WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT, WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MY DAD AND HOW RARE SORT OF WAS. (DR. LOME) 01.30 IT WAS THE LONGEST 5 MIN OF MY LIFE WAITING FOR THAT DEFIBRILLATOR TO COME, BUT WE GOT IT THERE. 35 (GREG) 09.37 I WOKE UP AN AMBULANCE GOING, UH OH, SOMETHING HAPPENED. 40 (DR. LOME) 02.09 IT WAS A FATAL ARRHYTHMIA CALLED VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION. THE ONLY WAY FOR THAT TO GO AWAY IS A SHOCK. AND WITHOUT A SHOCK, YOU DON'T MAKE IT. 17 / 02.31 BUT HE DID WAKE UP, WE GOT HIM INTO THE AMBULANCE STABLE. A LITTLE FRAZZLED, I STILL WASN'T LAST PLACE SO MIGHT AS WELL JUST KEEP ON RUNNING. 40 SO. BOTH DR. LOME AND HEILEMANN CONTINUE ON THEIR WAY. HEILEMANN CROSSES THE FINISH LINE FIRST. (MICHAEL) 13.07 I STARTED TO FEEL DIZZY. SO I HELD ON TO THE RAIL FOR A SECOND. AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNEW, I WOKE UP 13 DR. LOME FINISHES THE RACE MOMENTS LATER... (DR. LOME) 03.09 I THREW MY ARMS UP IN THE AIR THINKING YAY I FINISHED, THANK GOODNESS....AND THEN I HEAR SOMEBODY SAY WE NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE. 14 (BUTT TO) 03.20 AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. 21 HE PROBABLY JUST FAINTED THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS HAPPENING AGAIN. 24 BUT IT DID.

I HAD NO SYMPTOMS. I FELT FINE, THE WHOLE RACE 04 (DR. LOME) 04.12 IT'S REALLY MIND BLOWING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH, THEY SAY ABOUT 1 IN 200,000 RACE PARTICIPANTS IN A HALF MARATHON OR MARATHON HAVE A CARDIAC ARREST. 20 THERE'S ABOUT 5,000 RUNNERS THERE. THAT MAKES IT ABOUT A 1 IN 40 CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING ONCE. AND 1 IN 1,600 CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING TWICE IN A RACE. 29 BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THEM BOTH SURVIVING. ONLY 30% OF PEOPLE SURVIVE. AND THE SAME CARDIOLOGIST LITERALLY RIGHT BEHIND THEM BOTH....ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. 38 BOTH RUNNERS IN SHOCK... LEARNING THE NEWS.

QUESTION 18.21 HOW HAS THAT MOMENT AND THIS EXPERIENCE SHIFTED YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING EVERYDAY? 31 (GREG) EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY. FUN DAY. A CHALLENGE. BUT I'M THERE BECAUSE OF DR. LOME, NO DOUBT. AND THE NEUROSURGEON. 36 (MICHAEL) 19:34 FOCUS ON THE THINGS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE TIME FOR FOR THAT. BOTH....GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE. AND WITH THAT SECOND CHANCE, AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR STORY AND SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT HEART HEALTH. (DR. LOME) 06.47 THEY BOTH CHANGED THEIR DIET, THEY'RE EXERCISING, THEY'RE DOING GREAT. (BUTT TO) \u00e108.53 WE HOPE TO USE THIS TO INSPIRE OTHER PEOPLE TO LEARN CPR, EAT HEALTHY, AND TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS BECAUSE PREVENTION OF HEART DISEASE IS WAY MORE POWERFUL THAN TRYING TO FIGHT HEART DISEASE AFTER IT HAPPENS. 06 AND NOW...

IT'S A CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND SAY HEY I KNOW IT DIDN'T GO WELL LAST TIME BUT I'M GOING TO BEAT THIS. 47 (MICHAEL) 23.48 HAPPY THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE TOGETHER AND HAVE GONE THROUGH THE CHALLENGE AS A TEAM. 53> LAUREN SEAVER REPORTING.

BASEBALL SEASON MAY BE OVER, BUT IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY, YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE CRACK OF THE BAT AND DEPENDING ON THE WOOD YOU'RE USING THAT SOUND IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT WITH BATS LIKE MAPLE BEING A BIT LOUDER, HIGHER PITCHED, MAINLY BECAUSE OF T THE WAY THE WOOD COMPRESSES OVER TIME WHILE ASH SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT MORE HOLLOW. AND LOOK, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ASH HERE IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, WE KNOW THE BORDERLINE EXTINCTION THAT THOSE TREES ARE FACING, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THIS GUY, THE EMERALD ASH BORER. ACCORDING TO WISCONSIN DNR, TENS OF MILLIONS OF ASH TREES HAVE DIED OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES BECAUSE OF THIS INVASIVE INSECT. BUT THERE IS ONE FATHER SON DUO TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF THIS TRAGIC SITUATION BY TURNING ALL OF THAT DEAD WOOD INTO AWARD WINNING LUMBER. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATE. ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO, I STARTED NOTICING THE DEAD ASH TREES IN THE PROPERTY. WHEN WE MOVED TO THIS HOME, THE ASH WAS FALLING VICTIM TO THE EMERALD ASH BORER BEETLE. OH, IT'S A SHAME. YEAH, IT'S BORDERLINE EXTINCTION. I KNEW THAT WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN MAKE FIREWOOD FROM ALL THIS ASH. AND SO I THOUGHT, OKAY, LET'S. LET'S MAKE A BASEBALL BAT. I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO TURN 100 BATS. I CALL THAT MY APPRENTICESHIP. AND I TOLD MYSELF AFTER THAT 101ST BAT WE WERE GOING TO MAKE MONEY ON THEM. WE WERE GOING TO SELL IT, AND WE DID. I FELT LIKE I HAD EMERGED FROM THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE. NOW MY SON IS LEARNING. CAN YOU POINT OUT THE SAPWOOD THERE, THERE, THERE. IT'S BEEN VERY FUN GETTING TO DO THIS WITH MY DAD. A FEW YEARS AGO WE ENTERED THE ABADAN COUNTY FAIR. THE JUDGE ASKED AUGUST, DID YOU DO 80% OR MORE OF THE WORK? WOULD YOU SAY? AND HE WAS HONEST. AND HE SAID, NO, BECAUSE IF I WOULD HAVE HELPED MORE, THEN WE WOULD HAVE WON. HE WAS DISAPPOINTED AFTER OUR EXPERIENCE AT THE OZARK COUNTY FAIR, HIS INTEREST DEEPENED AND HE DECIDED HE WANTED TO TURN HIS OWN BAT AND ENTER IT T INTO THE FAIR. I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE SUMMER TO MAKE MY FIRST BASEBALL BAT. ONE MORNING WE WENT OUT AND WE PICKED OUT A TREE. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE. DO YOU CONCUR, DOCTOR? OH. OH, YEAH. THIS IS THE ONE, DAD. THE FIRST STEP IN OUR PROCESS. WE DROPPED A TREE. LET'S DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT. SEE THE MODELING? YES. SEE THAT? YEAH. IT'S GOING TO MAKE FOR A BEAUTIFUL BAT. THEN WE SPLIT IT UP INTO 38 INCH SECTIONS, AND THEN WE TRANSPORT THOSE BACK UP TO OUR STUDIO IN CEDARBURG, PUT THEM ON THE LATHE, AND WE TURN THOSE DOWN TO BILLETS. YOU'RE GOING TO TURN A BAT? NO PROBLEM FOR THE FAIR FOR SURE. ONCE WE'VE ACHIEVED THE SHAPE OF THE BILLET, WE INTRODUCE IT INTO OUR LIBRARY, WHICH IS A HUMIDITY CONTROLLED HUMIDOR AND WE SEASON THE BILLETS THERE TO OUR TARGET MOISTURE CONTENT, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 11 OR 10%. THIS IS NESTLED IN THERE NICELY. ALL RIGHT, AUGUST. COUNTY FAIR IS COMING. WE NEED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND PICK YOU OUT. A BLUE RIBBON BILLET. ONCE WE'VE SELECTED THE APPROPRIATE BILLET, REMOVED IT FROM THE LIBRARY. WE WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASUREMENTS ON MOISTURE CONTENT, WEIGHT, 77.9, AND THEN THAT'S WHEN THE SHAPING PROCESS HAPPENS. DOES THAT LOOK LIKE THE END OF A BASEBALL BAT? YEAH, AND I WAS ONLY THERE TO GUIDE HIM TO BE OPERATE IN A SUPPORTING ROLE. YEP. AND THEN YOU CAN DIG IT IN A LITTLE BIT. YOU GOT IT. IT'S WONDERFUL TO WATCH HIM ENGAGE IN A IN A PROJECT WHERE IT HAS HIS FOCUS. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SEE YOUR, YOUR CHILD FOCUSING ON A PROJECT, YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE HIT THE MARK AND YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING THAT IS APPEALING TO THEM AND THEY WANT TO LEARN IT, DUDE, WONDERFUL. AFTER THE BAT HAS BEEN SHAPED ON THE LATHE, SANDED TO A SMOOTH FINISH, WE'LL TAKE IT OFF THE LATHE AND THEN TRANSPORT IT DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT, INTO OUR PAINT BOOTH. AND THAT'S WHERE THE FINISHING OCCURS. AND THAT'S A COMBINATION OF STAIN PAINT AND TYPICALLY LACQUER. AND THEN THE FINAL STEP IN THE PROCESS IS TO APPLY OUR MAKER'S MARK.

Biden's upcoming meeting with Xi Jinping, pro-Palestine protests ...", "video_transcript": "so what does the US get out of this meeting let's ask former New York Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee zeldon Lee great to see you again thanks for being here uh I have no problems with talking to anybody I mean if you if you can talk in a civilized fashion but uh are we coming to this meeting from a position of strength or weakness well it's hard to say that we'd be coming from a position of strength when you don't have confidence that the president is going to be effectively achieving outcomes Rel Rel at to fentel Taiwan artificial intelligence Ukraine Israel whatever is going to come up at that table uh that President Biden is going to be tough on President Chi we can't sit here today and say that we're confident that we're going to be seeing the outcomes uh that we would set as goals as you and I sit here talking about it and you know it's hard to to to look at Biden in a meeting like this after all that we've discovered about his family's dealings with China uh some of which might be compromising to the president is is that a concern that Americans should have at this point uh that should be a really big concern this is something that should have been vetted out a very long time ago thankfully now uh with the good work of the House of Republicans were learning more as they conduct their oversight uh the Biden family received funding from CFC money that was paid to a shell company controlled by Hunter Biden uh then the money was distributed to a shell company uh controlled by James and Sarah Biden uh they then cut personal checks uh the personal checks that they cut to themselves Was Then followed by a personal check cut it to cut to Joe Biden himself and then they just slap on it a label of calling it aone and then they say that everything is okay uh this has been something that a lot of Biden family members have received funding from uh it's something that the American public deserves answers to and as President Biden says that he's running for re-election uh this is something that is important in the context of vetting out this candidate who wants another four-year term Lee I want to switch to domestic concerns specifically all these demonstrations now because of the war in the mid East uh in cities and on campuses a lot of them are actually in favor of Hamas and and certainly they're they can be construed as as in favor of the destruction of Israel because of that from the river to the sea sea comment that you see repeated even by a member of Congress if you were Governor though how would you balance the right to free speech in America with what's happening in our cities and in in campus and we should mention by the way that Grand Central Station one of the major transportation hubs of the nation was shut down again by these demonstrators last Friday night yeah and Free Speech goes to a certain point when you are are showing up at Grand Central and actually kicking down doors uh when you're on a college campus and you're preventing students from being able to get uh from their dorm to a classroom or they're being held hostage as we saw in Cooper Union uh inside of one of the buildings that there's no right to free speech if you decide to dress like a Hamas terrorist engage in rhetoric of a uh Hamas terrorist and then you are physically confronting Jews you're targeting Jews and physically confronting them and pushing them around as we saw what uh took place at at Harvard fortunately many of these incidents we're talking about are caught on camera um so that we can actually see the video and the pictures for themselves when you're causing destruction when you're causing property damage that you can't hide behind a protection of of a First Amendment right to free speech this has been uh frequently across this Country Crossing that line and if I was the governor of the you know of of the state of New York or any Governor right now uh I would be withholding a taxpayer dollars to some of these educ uh educational campuses uh where these Jewish students are being targeted uh I believe the National Guard uh should be called out to make sure that we're protecting uh these Jewish New Yorkers uh who are unfortunately unable to get from point A to point B there are tools of government right now that aren't being used and should be and we need moral Clarity on the part of people who run these college campuses uh to crack down on people within their own ranks who are pushing this Lee I have to ask you very quickly we're almost out of time but uh we just had an election last week in in which for the first time in 50 years 5 years uh the Bronx elected a city council woman uh from the Republican Party are are cities around the country beginning to realize that some of those policies that have been applied for the past 20 years and Democratic cities aren't working yes I was on the ground in the Bronx and the days leading up to that election christe marado the new city councilwoman in the Bronx was winning that race amongst a coalition of Republicans and Democrats and independents Fed Up by the direction of the city concerned about out of control migrant crisis the quality of Education in schools safety on the streets affordability uh this is an issue inside a New York City and other cities across the country I would encourage conservatives to do a better job getting into the cities because many of these longtime Democratic voters are waiting with open arms to

Noon the reality is the district has the funds they refuse to talk to us about class sizes and the impacts on our students and that is why they continue to keep kids out of school more than 40,000 students do not have class again today as the strike reaches its third week and just 10 minutes ago Portland Public Schools announced that schools will be closed again tomorrow you just heard from the president of the Portland Teachers Union putting the blame on the Portland Public Schools district for the strike but District officials say they addressed compensation prep time and class sizes in their latest offer PPS and the teachers union spent the weekend bargaining but couldn't reach a deal here's where things stand the district says its most recent proposal includes a onetime bonus and some student- centered Investments the union argues the district can do more and says it doesn't agree with the numbers that the district has been laying out the district meantime says its latest offer would require more than $100 million in budget cuts I've been saying this from the beginning you know compensation class size you have to manage those two dials or you could put your your school district in insolvency we don't want to do that well some parents are expressing a lot of frustration with all sides in the negotiations process saying it is keeping students from getting a proper educ I feel like the adults in the room have royally messed up meaning PPS Portland Teachers Union the legislature the governor the adults in the room can't get this together and work this out and our children are once again at home out of school and their education is suffering bargaining is scheduled to resume tomorrow today the city of Portland was supposed to start in en forcing its new daytime camping ban but the city is now in a holding pattern after a judge blocked enforcement for now a Moma County Judge made the decision last week a group of homeless portlanders sued the city in late September calling the ban unconstitutional given the lack of shelter space the judge granted a temporary block on enforcement as the case plays out in court homeless Advocates hope this gives leaders time to address the need for more resources and shelter space before the city starts enforcing the ban this gives us an opportunity to kind of reflect see how we're approaching this and I think we'll do it more strategically and we'll do it better I think at the end of the day we all want the same thing you know we all want people not living on the streets and most importantly the people that are living on the streets don't want to be there either mayor Ted wheeler says the city will continue to fight in court for the right to regulate unsanctioned camping today mark one year since four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death in their off-campus home in Moscow at 6:00 tonight there will be a vigil at the University to remember them Cory Howard with our sister station in Spokane has the story on this brisk autumn day for the first time in many months the backdrop of this Memorial that still stands is law enforcement the FBI collecting more evidence from the King Road House last year was a stark reminder crime can happen anywhere and violent crime happens everywhere but across the way with the Vandal logo proudly shining above the campus of the University of Idaho another kind of reminder is in motion it's about moving forward but not moving past on this day on this campus born out of tragedy for the past year the very definition of strength the Vandal Family Value has just really been reinforced looking out for one another caring for one another and those those those have been lasting legacies from from how we all came together from last fall through support near and far I've heard from people from all over the world uh over the last year dean of students bla Eckles that outpouring of care and support just means the world to us has watched his students and his staff his Vandal Community we have alumni checking in saying Vandal strong um we've got your back let us know how we can help and support persevere through unimaginable hurt I'm really proud of our students how they navigated through it last year just nothing but absolute pride in being a vandal myself and it's a community that even in the face of international attention from what happened continues to grow last year we had our largest uh first year class this year we had our second largest and eckol attributes that growth to the very Foundation the university is built on I think how we responded last year reinforced the importance of what we place as far as the value of our students and their safety care and concern I think that's a message that has resonated as well it hasn't been an easy Road by any means what happened last year shook everybody to our core without a doubt it was a scary time on campus and the process is not over I think some students still struggle with it for sure but Eckles says the Vandal family has been doing everything they can to protect a safe learning environment practical things like increasing security ultimately though culture has been cultivated by the vandals themselves by students just showing up on mass to so many events our athletic events our plays our programs eckel says the university as an educational institution after all has been offering students not only chances to learn to cope with loss through counseling and classes students are utilizing the support services they're showing up to our uh education programs they're excited to be here that's an an infectious vibe that many of our students have the S the changing colors and Falling Leaves Can signal the end of a once vibrant season as the students at the University of Idaho Shuffle off to class amidst the falling foliage on this October day they do so knowing perhaps better than some after the past year but it's really just the beginning in the cycle of healing they have an absolute love for this institution absolute love for their experience and absolute love for the four vandals that we lost back closer to home now we are taking a live look at Portland a bit of a gray day there for sure this is a shot from our Rose City sky cam some of those clouds from this morning cleared out a little bit meteorologist Chris mcginness is in for us this noon Chris what are we looking at weatherwise today we are starting to poke a few more holes in that cloud covering case in point behind me Christine this is the live look

we got a little blue sky above that as well so nice to see that we'll take you down to the solar Vineyard in dayon the low clouds breaking up a little bit there is a high thin overcast that's kind of filtering the sun down there and one more vantage point from out in the DS this is from our camera at top Oregon's Veterans Home in the DS this morning we've got kind of clearing sky on the east side of the state the west side of the state still has some residual uh we'll call them debris clouds from the front that blew through here late last night and early this morning with yes more rain there is in fact some rain do I have it showing up on radar let's go a little wider we've got some showers AC across the Far Eastern Columbia Basin and heading out into the waas and Southeast Washington those will continue pulling out also some showers down towards uh K Falls those two those two will continue lifting on off to the east all right right now from our uh Wells Fargo Sky camera again

South in the BAM Valley 53 last check in Salem the plan for today lots of clouds now and I think we will poke a few more holes in that cloud cover this afternoon with a high temperature probably not going very far from where we are right now about 56 or so and of course note the sunset before 5:00 right so partly cloudy this evening there could be some fog forming overnight tonight otherwise I

Houston Asos the uh ATR Park in cob County Georgia and Smyrna and the entire city is just a blaze with EXC excitement over this unexpected late season run of playoff run by the Atlanta Braves who uh had pretty much been decimated by injuries throughout the entire latter half of the 2021 season but outfielder Jorge salair who was a late season addition to the Atlanta Braves signed by general manager Alex anthopolos he' already hit one home run during the World Series in game one he would go on to hit two more and later become the World Series MVP as the Atlanta Braves would go on to defeat the Houston Astros during the World Series but we are talking about October 29th 2021 game three in between Innings or Solair is in the Outfield and the mall is not in play and he tosses a baseball into the stand you know really a time honored tradition of a lucky fan being able to catch a baseball especially during the World Series but then something unexpected happens two years later a plaintiff Myra Morris would file a lawsuit against Jorge solir in the Atlanta brid she claims that she was struck in the eye by the baseball thrown by Solair taken to a medical uh treatment facility inside truis Park and sustain some she has alleging some pretty catastrophic serious injuries and we are joined this morning here on Atlanta news first and Atlanta Kei isn't there some sort of recognition when you go to a baseball game that you can get hit by a ball or a bat well first thank thank you for having me that was a very impressive uh recollection of uh the 2021 World Series run uh I'm an avid Braves fan so I remember all that and brings back some really good memories uh but um absolutely there is um what the courts have referred to as the Assumption of risk uh under the Baseball rule uh Major League Baseball to include the Atlanta brav uh have uh language on any uh of the uh StubHub tickets or wherever you get your um baseball tickets from that essentially states that you are um consenting to attending the event and at that event uh there will be live baseballs um that happen to go go into the stands as you said it's a time honored um part of baseball that that's why fans bring their baseball gloves to the stadiums uh this case is interesting in that we are not talking about a foul ball uh we're not talking about a bat that has slipped out of um a batter's hands we've seen that throughout the years we're talking about a baseball that is thrown into the stands and I think that the legal issue will be how is that throw characterized is it characterized as the traditional toss uh after the pitcher has warmed up the outfielder tosses it into the stands to uh waiting fans who are trying to get that ball as a souvenir or as the uh plaintiff's attorney has described it as an overhand High Velocity throw that went in to the stands uh when his client was not suspecting any live game action because it was in between Innings so I think that the big thing is uh through the discovery process which the attorneys will engage in is is there any video of this incident uh video would be very um important to characterizing this throw I don't think anybody is alleging that uh Mr Solair had any ill intent um but what they are alleging is that he was negligent in the manner in which he tossed that ball into the stance and so I believe that that will be the legal issue uh because it does go outside of the scope of the traditional Baseball rule which covers foul balls and if you are um in a part of the stadium that is uncovered uh then you would assume that risk so that's the fascinating part about this this lawsuit that we have and I must say as well well uh lastly that the the the lawsuit comes right up against the statute of limitations in the state of Georgia there's a 2-year statute of limitations on all personal injury claims or two years from the time that the injury should have reasonably been um been discovered and and so in this case um it does appear that they waited until uh that very 11th hour and possibly they were trying to get the Atlanta Braves to resolve the case and settle which happens quite often prior to the filing of a lawsuit and that that was a a great answer to a question that I was going to answer or ask next when we first heard about this lawsuit and realized that it's almost two years after the fact you know why why do you think it took so long and and you just answered that because it was coming up against the stat un of limitations is that correct yes sir and uh frequently attorneys want to uh have their clients receive as much treatment as possible before engaging in any type of settlement because you don't know what the medical expenses are going to be it appears that some of her injuries are uh ongoing she's still seeing a physician for her eye injuries and so you want to be able to quantify what those expenses are because you only do get one opportunity to resolve a case of this nature and so uh from a financial standpoint an attorney does want to have a a full picture of what the injuries are before uh going forward to uh any kind of settlement agreement or filing of a lawsuit poor H as as I mentioned earlier went on to become the World Series MVP he was not resigned during the Braves off season and now signed a three-year deal with the Miami Marlins obviously he's a power hitting uh outfielder as evidence by his home run total can obviously you know is probably pretty capable of of really firing a baseball with a lot of velocity but how do you prove that he intentionally threw the ball into the spans with so much force as to cause this injury I mean you you obviously said a few moments ago we have to find out if there's a video off the incident what um what other avenues does the plan of have to proving her allegations well that's a great Point um this case uh if there is not any video evidence will kind of come down to how cases have been decided uh for hundreds of years in this country and it's eyewitness testimony uh we all know that video makes things more um convenient and definitive uh but if there are any of of the patrons uh who are in the stands and can attest to the fact that the ball came in out of nowhere at a high velocity then then that could be evidence of his uh negligence and I want to stress the word negligence versus intent because intent is a word that we usually use with criminal offense uh versus someone who is acting in a manner that um they are not using the amount of care or caution that they should use uh and that a reasonable person would expect them to use and so um ultimately I believe that the injuries are severe but it does face a legal hurdle um in proving that this is beyond the scope of what's customary baseball games the Baseball rule is in full effect uh courts throughout the entire country have referred to that actually in 2003 um Braves uh great Andrew Jones uh was sued by a fan uh for a foul ball that went into the stands the court of appeals uh uh ruled in favor of Andrew Jones and the Atlanta Braves and that um the fan consented to um at least in part uh assuming the risk of those type of incidents occurring so it really will come down to whether the attorneys for the ball Club are able to adequately convince a court that what Jorge Solair did is not beyond the scope of what we see baseball players do um every day throughout the season um because that's why fans uh sit where they sit that's why they ask for those balls and and and that's why more than any other sport the fan interaction in baseball I believe is the most you have uh ball boys along the side uh foul lines they toss balls into the stance all the time balls are exchanged all the time a pitcher doesn't like a ball he throws it to the Umpire tosses it that ball goes somewhere so um I think that that's what makes B special and uh we certainly feel horrible that um Miss Norris has these injuries uh but it will be a fascinating case as to how the courts interpret the Baseball rule in the context of an outfielder or um any player on defense throwing a ball into the stands one of the Chan of this actually ever Mak it to a jury I think that the that the chances that it gets to a jury are minimal uh first uh the great majority of civil cases never make it to a jury uh we have a tremendous backlog in the state of Georgia and throughout the country of criminal cases uh due to the courts being closed for about um a year and a half due to the pandemic and so uh the criminal cases have been taking priority in our court system to to try to get back up to speed but also um this is a case that the Atlanta Graves could easily resolve I mean um I don't know the amount of Damages uh that has been requested but it appears that the medical expenses are about $60,000 so um it just uh will first go to through the discovery process and I would suspect that the attorneys for the Atlanta Braves are going to file a motion uh to dismiss on summary judgment essentially stating that uh this individual has not not um put forth the amount of evidence needed to allow this lawsuit to go forward for the reasons that we've discussed we are wrapping up our conversation with Georgia attorney and personal injury law practitioner Keith Johnson talking about the lawsuit by a fan who claims that Atlanta BR former Atlanta bres outfielder hor Solair uh through a baseball engine stands with such force that it caused some very serious injuries to her eye Keith's final thoughts just put a put a kind of a bow on on our conversation and tell our viewers and listeners what um one of the major issues involved in this and where where do you think this will ultimate or how do you think this will ultimately be resolved well I want the viewers to know that injuries at baseball stadiums are actually more uh frequent than one would think uh I did some research and I found uh according to NBC news about 800 uh fans have um reported serious injuries uh ranging from loss of vision um to uh having a concussion from baseballs going into the stands and and that time frame was about a seven-year time frame uh so it is more frequent than you would think um I do believe that in this case uh the legal hurdle of proving that Mr Solair was negligent in his actions is going to be one that is uh going to be difficult it's going to be difficult because baseball is a sport just like I said that has a lot of fan interaction and to prove that his actions went beyond the scope of what we've seen time and time again and our own um uh viewing of sport is a very high hurdle and so um I do believe that uh there is not a precedent for the Atlanta Braves to necessarily resolve this case um on the front end they had an opportunity presumably so to uh do that and so um how far is uh the court going to allow the Baseball rule to extend is the legal question and I do believe that it is fascinating um if we look at it from the standpoint of what precedent is this going to set going forward um lastly baseball was proactive in 2019 after a slew of lawsuits about foul balls and they uh uh put the or or the The netting was expanded um and so as a fan I've I've sat close and sometimes uh I've complained about the netting because I do like the uh Clear View but I certainly understand it from a legal point of view uh and so I think that will also come into play that reasonable steps have been taken to protect fans and that this was just an accident and sometimes accidents happen but they don't rise to the level of um a lawsuit where the brace would be financially responsible and I'm like you I mean I'm a a huge baseball fan I've often complained about the obstructive VI behind the net but this is just part of the the the nation's society and sports and legal society as well but we are thankful to Keith Johnson for joining us this uh on this edition of

and how I made it to where I am now being 33 years old with no life this is actually a video kind of reacting and giving my own commentary in regards to a video that I recently seen on YouTube the YouTuber's name is XOXO aotu aotu I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing your name wrong sweetie but it's a response video to um what she stated how she's feeling right now being a millennial and basically feeling as though her life has no Direction so if you haven't seen the first video please click in the description box down below for that link or I'll link it up here somewhere where so that you can go see that first then come back here and view the video okay so anyways um if this is the type of content that you like make sure you like comment and subscribe if you like content like this and let's get into this video so the next topic that she talked about was her getting married at 25 and then she end up getting a divorce at 30 the marriage lasted from for 5 years the advice that I would give to any young woman now being 302 and getting married at 23 years old y'all baby live your life live your life okay please live your life baby girl I be seeing so many girls like trying to like I want to get married and have kids and they're only like 18 19 years old live your life okay live your life like you have your whole life to do all of that you get what I'm saying like you have your whole life to do all of it I will say having kids when you're younger is different from having kids when you're older I will say that but there are pros and there are cons okay depend upon upon what type of person you are everybody's situation is their own you get what I'm saying I will say having children while you're younger bodywise it's a lot less taxing like having children is taxing on your body either way your body and your mental health but on your physical body it is less taxing having your children young mentally though it's a little because you're young yourself like you get what I'm saying and it's like who says that you have the patience to actually deal with children and I need people to start being honest with that can we please start being honest with the fact that not everybody who has kids has the patience to actually deal with children okay some people were not taught some people genuinely just don't have the patience [\u00a0__\u00a0] some people don't have the patience to deal with themselves let Al some kids it's hard raising kids like a lot of the stuff that my mom when she was fank me or something like that I didn't understand it until I had my own kids now I'm like well no wonder I would get my beat all the time like no wonder cuz like I just wouldn't listen my kids don't listen either now I don't whoop they all the time they do get spanking with my older ones oh baby give me the game it's a rap you're about to just sit and look at the wall and read a book that's what you're about to do but you know my youngest one if she do something a couple of times and I done told her like three or four times to stop baby I am going to get that leg that leg is going to get got it's going to get give here the leg is mine instances I ain't you know but some people don't and I need for women to be okay with admitting that you know they ain't got the patience to really deal with kids not not a lot of people got that you know the the pros of having children when you're young is that you're able to grow with your children you get what I'm saying um but I feel like the pros of having children when you're older is that you're a little bit more wise and you have a little bit more patience you get what I'm saying like I don't know it's it's like and in life unless you're like K gender is somebody which most people aren't but you're more stable in life you get what I'm saying saying like financially the relation I will hope if you're having children later past 30 that you're inside of a stable you know relationship or you've been through you know enough relationships to know like okay I'm having my child by somebody who's going to actually be a partner and not just you know a baby daddy but um yeah so I will say like that some of the pros and cons some of some more cons that I would say from having kids young you you don't even know you half the time so it's like you sitting here you making these decisions on like when you don't even know you all the way yet you get what I'm saying so it's like oh I'm getting married and having kids with this person and you probably don't even know them all the way because they don't even know them all the way so it's like 4 years go by and y'all were 18 when you got together now y'all 22 and y'all are just totally different people from when y'all were 18 when you got married you know and now all of a sudden y'all got a kid y'all done got a house well some people may not got a home but y'all didn't start having kids and y'all got joint finances and all the rest of this stuff and it's like y'all frontal lobe ain't even see here and develop all the way yet like it ain't even there all the way and y'all didn't make all these grown adult decisions when it's like yeah so by the time you turn 28 29 when you hit your Saturn return if you don't know what a Saturn return is just YouTube it you hit your Saturn return at 28 and 29 and now you're like WTF what the f is going on with my life was I in a whole days before this time like I don't even know who you are I'm just not finding out who I am and I don't want to be in this anymore so now you're getting a divorce and um the kids are now being co-parent to so that's all I'm saying like when it comes to like the marriage part I really really feel like people like you don't really know who you are you don't become seasoned into knowing who you truly are until after the age of like 35 36 almost 40 to be honest um but you would have went through a lot of BS by the time you turned 30 to make a lot more better decisions in regards to the like relationship areas and the having kids area instead of you know when you're like 18 19 years old you're just getting out of high school you don't really know who you are in the world you know who you were in high school you know the hierarchies and stuff in high school but coming out of high school and going into the real world where nobody really gives a f you don't know who you are just yet so to sit there and then become a wife and have kids and do all this stuff your identity then becomes that when that may not even be who you are and you don't know that yet because you haven't experienced anything to know who what who you really are and what you want to do with your life and stuff like that so guys I'm going to inser a clip here of Queen niga elaborating on you know what I just said love the girls that's like all about them putting their s first like sometimes I be envying the girls I sometimes sometimes I envy the girls and I hate to say this but I'm just be real it's about being real right sometimes I envy the girls that get to wake up with no kids kids and like literally get to design their apartment the way that they want and like literally go and just do whatever they want do everything for them I literally was telling my other friend that the other day I was like like the girls that don't got kids and they don't have like all the other things like we have like their lives look so like together organized their house be clean all the time and it's just like their clothes be perfect and it's so I don't like let's not say this because I love my kids I got two kids by the way she got one kid if y'all don't know she's a new Mommy I just had a well like it's been a year I ain't going to say that yeah she just had a baby a year ago and um shoot I started with my I had CJ at 19 I got married at 19 right and then like from that relationship that failed I went right into another relationship so you and then had another baby like and so I've never gotten a chance know yourself like to know you or to do you it's really hard like I'm still trying to learn myself like outside of just music and like I'm trying to I'm trying to learn myself while still trying to become a wife too a wife and the best mom a better mom I get you it's hard to do all of that like I feel like sometimes I got to choose well you do and that's and I feel like a lot of women deal with that like we and then we go through depression sometimes because we do lose oursel in the process because we're trying to be all these things at one time and not just be ourselves but it's like you can't really just be just yourself you have to be you have to you got to do the you got to do all of it a wife is a totally different thing category whatever label a whole another conversation for a whole another and then a mom is a totally different job and then you yourself that's how do you I know you be asking me question but how do you me personally experiencing what I've been through within my own marriage I honestly wouldn't have gotten married until maybe 2 years ago I wouldn't have had kids until maybe two years ago two to three years ago so AA I feel like Ava I Ava would have been my first child I'm grateful for my children don't get me wrong I love my boys I love my 10-year-old and my 8-year-old but y'all if you have not already go to how I met my toxic baby daddy story and you will understand all the stupid I was doing at that time to get into the position that I was in to sit here and I barely I got pregnant after a month and 3 months of dating my my baby daddy if you could call it dating it wasn't even really dating cuz he was still out here you know cheating and doing all the rest of this go go watch the video go watch the video me personally and I feel like men don't really like like mature for real for real they try to give you that whole little spill and they give you those good sweet you know nothing trying to make it seem like they on their grown man but to be honest no they don't really like mature for real for real until after 30 personally I would I I got lucky y'all I will say that it may be in my my natal chart but I will say that I got lucky when I got with my my husband because he is a very standup guy he has Integrity um we've never had to really deal we've never had to deal with cheating or anything like that within our marriage we are both really honest with each other like if I did find anything like towards the beginning of our marriage of course I was 23 he was 25 We Were Young y'all he would be inside of DMS and stuff but nothing more than that it was never like him going and physically like cheating on me or anything like that but like I said men don't mature until 30 and my husband he will be 35 this year so around the age of 30 31 I will say that's when he matured to the point where it was like we wasn't fussing and fighting and arguing and [\u00a0__\u00a0] every single day okay we had to go to marriage counseling and everything because baby when I say he was a hot mess it wasn't even like Dylan o of course I told you like the DMS and stuff like that but just like the immaturity of how he would talk to me I was overweight mind you I was overweight because I had your [\u00a0__\u00a0] child sir and I had a child before that so if you don't know my baby daddy is separate from my husband they I have a baby daddy he has since passed away and I have a husband yeah so he like I was overweight and you know like he didn't know how to cater to that and my emotions and stuff like that because stuff dealing with his childhood and how his he was raised and a lot of times when you're young like that 18 19 years old you don't think about stuff like that you don't think about how somebody was raised is going to affect your relationship like I didn't think about that I was just out here you know being a hot girl at 21 and got pregnant and then you know I didn't want to sit here and be another baby mom mother and I didn't want my son to not have a father figure so you know I end up me well actually he came and met me he came to my job and we met and we end up falling you know into our relationship cuz initially I after dealing with my baby daddy for 9 months I said oh baby no I'm good I don't want no relationship I don't want to do none of this I'm I'm I'm great I'm good and then my husband end up just popping up y'all he just popped up y'all and he was he he he has always been a great a good man I'll say he's been a good man he has had his flaws though we you know it's it's on a spectrum okay it's just he had a lot of immaturity that did not get resolved until he was around 30 31 yeah yeah it was to a point like if I cried he wasn't attentive to me like it's just a lot of stuff that wasn't taught and it we it had to be taught over the span of our relationship that's what I say yeah people don't talk about this though like when when they talk about like marriage and stuff especially getting married young like they just sit here and be like oh they got married young they don't talk about like how they got married young but then they have all these freaking issues in the beginning it wasn't until the the marriage settled around like year eight both of y'all settled into the marriage and you know came to you you agreed to disagree and learned how to compromise in the relationship that you know things became all peaches and Roses and Rainbows okay like even now like sometimes he still get on my nerves but it's not as bad as the first four years woo baby they always tell you the first five the first five if you make it past the first five then it's like oh okay that's good but then you get to the seventh year and that's called the seveny year itch and baby on our Seven Year Itch we were separated we did separate the seventh Year yes we did cuz I said I'm tired of this I'm tired of this and that was around when he was um um yeah 30 31 it took for us that 7ear inch I don't know what it did it changed both of us baby though but we came back stronger we we were separated for about 6 seven months we didn't live together and then I gave him no ultimatum I said well uh I don't believe in separation like this this been a long time 6 months 6 months is a very long time I said um served them with divorce papers I said here you go cuz we ain't about to elongate this no more and that's when he said oh sh I'm about to lose my whole family I can't be out here playing around no more no so I gave him pushed him the divorce papers and then he brought his tail on back home y'all he ain't been going since he ain't been going since he came right on girl all his friends cuz he stay I called it the fat house he was living with his brother and his friend they were all rooming together in the little house or whatever so he had went over to the fat house for 6 months but then he realized while he was over in the fat house like damn none of these get like that like Dam you going through that out here in these dating streets and that's when he realized like I got something good at home let let me go on home let let me go on on home yeah mhm oh okay he came back correct y'all that's the only reason why he he got back in baby cuz when I say I was done oh he knew I was done to he knew it and I started I started going to school I started doing it this was in 2020 y'all the end of 2020 August to February of 2021 so yeah M ain't nobody playing so but I feel like to alleviate all of that if you are like 18 19 right now even 21 years old girl live your life date however many dudes you want to just don't get pregnant please don't do that date who you want to like date however many men you want to no [\u00a0__\u00a0] shaming over here baby just make sure not to date dudes within the same group do I need to say that again do not date any from the same group if that's his homeboy he been his homeboy for the last 10 years seven F do not date his homeboy don't do that God don't do that get dudes from different sets goodness do you you get what I'm saying like do you don't be sitting here you know tying yourself down to one man who don't want to commit like what no like who doing that cuz these dudes will do whatever they want to do and then try to pick you up off the shelf like you some little toy ain't nobody got time for that live your life experience your life and my thing is when I say date I mean I don't mean sleep with I mean date get to know whoever you want to get to know and if you see the red flags up front immediately I need you to run don't be sitting there talking about oh what I could change him no either they got it or they don't baby and I didn't come to the realization of that until I had my baby daddy and then I got with my husband when I got with my husband I just he just it was in his characteristics like it was just in him to be a standup guy that the reason why I'm saying that I can't I can't elaborate on it right now but there was a situation that happened within our relationship on my part um and my husband was a stand up guy guy that's what I'll say and I was able to have the comparison between the situation with my baby daddy and my husband and it made me realize like oh this man really loves me he really loves me and he really wants our family and he really wants to be with me because of who I am so date sweetie date however many men you want to date date I'm not saying throw your hot pocket around that is not what I'm saying what I'm saying is date get to know whoever you want to get to know know Let it Go on from there and make sure you write down what your standards and requirements are characteristic wise within a man I know money is the the main topic nowadays he got to have money yes he got to have money but I'm not saying he got to have like Jeff Bezos Bill Gates type of money baby I'm saying he needs to be able to take care of himself he needs to at least have some assets he needs to at least have a a car okay A Car even if he rooming or something can it be him and his cousin living together he ain't still at his mama house it could be him and a roommate or something cuz then if y'all two get together then y'all can be roommates and y'all can split or do whatever y'all do with the bills that's going to be another topic because y'all I don't know what the heck is going on with y'all and the splitting of the bills when you in a relationship if y'all are not living together I mean if y'all are living together and your man don't make a astronomical amount and when I say astronomical amount baby I mean he's making at least $2 to $300,000 a Year y'all should be splitting some [\u00a0__\u00a0] whether it's him paying the rent and then you paying all of the utilities because or you know him paying the rent you paying the utilities and then y'all going uh Dutch on the kids clothes or you know he pay for the food when y'all go out one time or you pay for the food one time when y'all go out like it could be like that where it's like a a back and forth you know T to racket ball type of thing um but the he got to pay for everything he got to pay for everything tell me that's wild cuz it's like well where what are you invested into the relationship and a lot of time a lot of these relationships that y'all are in y'all ain't even got kids y'all ain't even got kids and you talking about you want him to pay for everything so as a woman what are you bringing to the table cuz normally is that normally like oh when she's at home watching the kids a lot of a lot of women ain't having kids nowaday so it's like well why are you expecting him to sit here and pay for everything that's crazy to me now if it's your birthday yeah he should be paying for the meal and he should be coming he should be stepping with the gifts okay you didn't had all year you know where my birthday is you done had all year to get this together so on S on occasions like that Valentine's Day [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know when Valentine's Day is all year but on a regular basis if he want to do something cute like go to the Dollar Store and get you some candy cuz he know that's your favorite candy why are y'all looking down at that walking into the relationship for dates yeah I feel like we should go to at least a I meant to say four to five star restaurant depending upon how long we've been talking and that's why me personally I ain't going out with nobody until we've been talking for maybe two months maybe two months we've been sitting here talking and getting to know each other then I'm going to go out on the first date with you and reason being is for those women who are trying to keep the kitty cat cuz some women you know when you young and stuff I know at least for me if I like I and then I was sitting here wondering why he ain't want to take me out on no dat or nothing so if you one of them type of girls talk to this [\u00a0__\u00a0] for like a month or two talk to him consistently for a month or two then I'm pretty sure by that time you'll know and he'll know if he really want to F with you like that or not and at that point I'm pretty sure he's going to spend the $200 on the meal or whatever the case may be but y'all women going in feeling like y'all Beyonce when y'all ain't did nothing ain't even giving this man good conversation and you just expecting for him to go in and pay $2 $300 for a first day no to me that's crazy that's crazy and then if you've been talking to him for a month or two consistently he not going to off rip be trying you know he ain't seen you so he can't be doing all that extra sexual stuff and expecting for you to sit here and give him sex cuz he took you out on a $200 date by this time y'all have been talking and getting to know each other for a month month and a half two months you get what I'm saying like he's not that's not going to be the first thing on his mind because he's gotten to know you you get what I'm saying that's just some little buffers I know some people probably like why would I sit and talk to somebody consistently for two months without seeing them because that's going to let you know if somebody really messed with you or not with my husband baby he ain't get no CA cat for 10 months I was pregnant when we met so all he could do was talk to me get to know me and take me out on a date I was pregnant I wanted to go to the movies but you know 7 months pregnant baby I ain't trying to do nothing like I ain't trying to sting them uncomfortable seats this was back when they didn't have a reclining seats and stuff so who feel like doing that no we end up going to his house I fell asleep on his couch and then he woke me up maybe like an hour or so later and was like hey you want me to take you home and I said yeah and I went home not every sing and as you can see 10 years later $450,000 house he has his uh $100,000 business and we got our three beautiful children and I got my nice beautiful career working as an analyst so it's like not every like situation starts off as you envisioned it like that's why you need to take the time to get to know somebody not oh well based off of this first date of him taking me to a 300 dollar meal that's going to judge like you know if we have chemistry or not no no why even like waste your time going out on a date with somebody who you just going to sit there and be bored with y'all ain't even got no chemistry or nothing all you did was get a free meal like I don't like putting that type of energy out there that's some using type energy like if you know off rip that this ain't a dude that you really trying to mess with like that he ain't really got no personality like that and you still choose to go out on a DAT with him because you know he got money I don't like that type of energy she don't want to put that type of energy out there because then that's stopping the real man who really going to make you happy cuz you entertaining yourself with peons and [\u00a0__\u00a0] when you could have just been at home continuing to manifest baby sitting here wasting your energy on this this whack dude all because you wanted some some oysters who could have sat there and went to the store got your own oysters did a self-care night learned how to cook some oysters so when your your man come he can see here here and take you to go get oysters or you could cook some as a afro before y'all have the most amazing sex in life cuz instead of sitting there wasting your time with these whack dudes that you know who got money you is at home manifesting and working on yourself to attract the man your your the perfect man for you any these are just my thoughts y'all nobody is saying that it's a law and you have to take my b or my stuff is set in stone nobody is saying that this is my opinion on getting married young relationships and marriage and stuff like that and having kids if you are 32 33 years old and you don't have any children don't feel bad like I need for people to stop feeling bad like some people you're not meant to have children in your 20s you get what I'm saying you may be 40 something and that's the time when you're supposed to have children like stop letting Society put these con structures on your life and how you feel about yourself because you see everybody else doing something in a certain amount of time like to be honest when I was 21 and Pregnant not a lot of people and my friends around me were having children you get what I'm saying so I actually felt alone because I had to mature faster than the rest of my peers so it was kind of lonely being that young having children it just I don't know it was really lonely for me so don't like don't try to sit there and do things and everyone else's timing like do it in your own timing everybody said that oh you should get married at 18 19 20 21 22 somewhere in your 20 no get married in your timing based off of your relationship like I need people to start like being freeth thinkers and I recently watched a video about how Society conditioned us and why I may come with another video on that like my thoughts and response to that video other thing that she said was after she had got a divorce she relocated so that's another thing too if you're having issues and you know everybody may not be into astrology and astrography and stuff like that if you don't know what they are please YouTube it there are tons of videos online about what astrography and astrology are but astrography particularly I used that in my life last year if you don't know I moved from Michigan to New Mexico I'm currently in New Mexico and my life has literally taking a 360 um from how it was 2 years ago from like the end of 2021 till now and that's because I reached out to an astrologer and I got my astrography maps and I figured out where I had good energy at and um you know where's a good place for me to move to like elevate my life basically so when I was in Michigan y'all I could never get a house that was like this no matter how much I tried I had the credit the down payment the money everything for it everybody just kept kept closing the doors in my faces but as soon like y'all as soon as I came to new as soon as I reached out was calling people to get housing immediate approval like oh yeah here stuff I would never have been able to get approved for in Michigan literally was just like thrown at me yeah I'll put my astrologers information down in the um description box below if you do choose to sign up with her make sure you tell her AJ sent um sent you over now my thing is you get what you pay for so my girl is great when I say amazing she is literally she pinpoints everything okay timing everything so um she is she it does cost a little bit of money I was I would suggest for you to get a purpose package and relocation package and those are wrapped in ones so that's why the prices are the way that they are but it's worth it I say I took a risk I went and I paid that price and baby I have sat there and got back tfold what I put in okay I end up getting a job making two times what I was making before I moved out here so the current job where I'm doing like this for master duties and stuff I got that in February I moved in December got this job new job in February making double what I was making at the job before that and that's just for moving okay so um one thing I will suggest if you're trying to make a change and you're trying to find your purpose and you're feeling as though oh my God I'm just at this place in life where I don't know what to do where to go please please reach out to my astrologer and that's one thing that I did too I did do a purpose package and a relocation package so I know what my purpose is you get what I'm saying and then moving here like that was like the the cherry on top okay every I have everything has flowed way better from moving away from my hometown and coming here and pursuing my dreams now at this point uh if y'all like content like this make sure you like comment

Leader this is the MTN new news good afternoon and thanks for joining us on the new news I'm Dian Parker Miller has our Monday forecast plus breaking overnight news on the 2024 presidential race but first our top story we begin with new details on another weekend of violent crime in Billings two men are behind bars for a shooting in Lockwood turned highspeed Chase through Billings mtn's Charlie klepps reports I'm standing near the intersection of canary Avenue and Bluebird Street in Lockwood and this is where Saturday night's chaos began multiple residents say the suspects began by breaking into cars in the area eventually leading to a confrontation and multiple shots fired it was frightening because you could tell they were close Lockwood resident Helen Hendrickson never expected her neighborhood to turn into a crime scene them weren't fireworks them were definitely gunshots that's exactly what happened Saturday evening as shots rang out a couple hundred ft from where she lives and there was six seven eight rounds went off just Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam and then of course you hear the sirens coming those shots coming about 30 minutes after Hendrickson discovered two people breaking into a car outside of her home there was somebody in my grandson's vehicle not thinking I just beelined it out the door and come running up the drive and said get out of here and she wasn't alone and my phone sent me a notification that somebody was sitting here peeking through my car with a flashlight Christy Allen got this shocking photo from her security camera the suspects using a flashlight to peer inside the windows of her car and I just called 911 they said that they have officers in the area here shortly and about 10 minutes later is when all the activity happened over on Canary of the shooting according to the Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office the victim of the shooting confronted the suspects forcing them to run away a few minutes later they returned approaching the armed victim the suspect then fired multiple rounds from the vehicle striking the victim multiple times the victim is being treated currently for life-threatening injuries they didn't break any car windows from what I saw they didn't even try to break my car window but then they had the audacity to shoot somebody who confronts them for doing that it's just it's insane deputies say they located one of the suspects 19-year-old Devon J isacson in the area he was arrested on outstanding warrants but their search continued for the second suspect which turned into a high-speed chase all the way to Billings a shocking that left many like Hendrickson up late I'm very worried I really am I know my sister and that want me to move out of here but where am I going to go it's going to happen anywhere in Lockwood Charlie klips MTN news that Lockwood shooting led to a highspeed Chase through town that ended somewhere in this area nearly 10 miles away from where the original crime began still down on first North 50 mil hour traffic minimum the chase weaving through downtown Billings they're shooting window at me with shots being fired at a sheriff's deputy and leading into quiet neighborhoods with the driver 18-year-old Ashton Glenn going up into yards and dodging parked cars in a stolen vehicle I was at work and my ring camera went off Roxy Zeller witnessed the happenings right in front of her home from her phone causing her to grow concerned I mean I got scared because I didn't know what was going on according to the Yellowstone County Sheriff's office after a Chase through several streets in the area Glenn crashed into an unoccupied car near 7th Street West in Terry Avenue but fled on foot Billings police the fire department and Highway Patrol assisted the Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office in the search lighting up streets and flying drones I was afraid to come home last night Glenn was found hiding under a vehicle in the area near 6 in Broadwater treated for minor injuries and taken into Yellowstone County Detention Facility where he was booked on two counts of attempted homicide it's scary to think of all of this that's going on and such young kids is what's sad it is unknown if Glenn had a firearm when he fled after the crash and the sheriff's deputies were still searching for any evidence Sunday morning they're asking the public to contact dispatch if you have anything in the area that you find in Billings Haley Monaco MTN news new this noon house Speaker Mike Johnson is pitching a new plan to avoid a government

after the Rafa border crossing from Gaza was closed and that's a look at some of the day's top [Music] stories happy Monday everybody our local forecast coming up here in just a bit but first what's going on across the us today with those headlines for the 48th Gulf Coast states we're looking at cool temperatures and beneficial rains some drought conditions down there so they can really use that rainfall the Washington Cascades the northern Rockies we do have some accumulating snow expected for the higher elevations over the next few days Inter Mountain West also across a large area of the Plains and into the Midwest we're looking at mild temperatures in our areas yeah we're looking at warmer than average temperatures today we do have a system coming through today tonight tomorrow morning that may knock our temperatures down just a bit but in even stronger system coming in Wednesday into Thursday what does that mean for us I'll let you know coming up the Lewis and Clark interpretive Center is hosting a talk on Tuesday about Fort Benton and the Lewis and Clark expedition the portter drout chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation is hosting historian Ken Robinson to lead a discussion on the great Portage decision point and other specific aspects of Lewis and Clark's Journey one of the things that pory drought has done L four years is to have scholarly speakers and so every month again we have an event or a speaker and so Ken was chosen because he is a well-known historian the great Portage involved the Expedition crew hauling all of their boats and supplies out of the Missouri River and around the Great Falls the event was incredibly strenuous while the geography was unforgiving Fort Benton remembers Lewis and Clark so he's talking about the Prelude to the Expedition the port around here and the critical decision at decision point which is up the way the roadways and they could have gone down a different River and they both looked exactly the same as Fort Benton was originally the main town of this area Robinson's lecture will focus on its historical significance as well as why the interpretive Center is in Great Falls rather than Fort Benton it's important to um talk about everybody and everything because there's lots of aspects lots of science lots of geography lots of botany because it was a scientific Expedition so it really is worthwhile if people are interested either from a conservation standpoint or history or just to get your kids out to do something interesting it is worth following for more information about the event you can head to our website in Great Falls I'm Tommy Lynch MTN news up next Miller in with another check of the day's weather plus we meet this month's waiting [Music] child",

Institute, joins 'Power Lunch' to discuss the U.S.-China relationship ...", "video_transcript": "so can anything significant come out of this high stakes meeting between President Biden and China's president she let's ask Dereck scissors Asia Economist at the American Enterprise Institute Derek uh any hopes here for things getting better or just maybe the fact that they're talking means things might not get worse yeah I think that might not get worse is probably the the biggest hope I don't know that things should get better uh Xi Jinping has been in charge of the communist part for 11 years now uh I don't think his behavior is going to change I think the problems the US has with China are going to continue and therefore you're not looking for some big Improvement in relationships you're looking to put a floor under the relationship the one possible exception is a deal over fentanyl it's been discussed at least here in Washington for the past few weeks there would be problems implementing that deal and enforcement of that deal but that is something that could be announced and we could hope for enforcement on the Chinese side in in 2024 I not to take this too far a field but that's really interesting and do you think it could actually do something to significantly change the kind of uh uh arrival of fentanyl in this country well we know you know there's a lot of uncertainty here but we know that fentanyl precursor production is dominated by China this is globally we know that fentanyl is arriving uh in the US from Mexico and that there are links between Chinese producers and then Mexican buyers of those precursors so if China were were motivated to really crack down which of course it is capable of doing in a wide range of areas crackdowns are kind of a Chinese specialty under Xi Jinping if it's motivated to crack down on that precursor production then it would matter um the problem is that China makes agreements with the contingency that they don't say which is unless you're mean to us unless you're too critical of us so uh if the US is critical of China in 2024 during the election campaign say then you wouldn't see that Chinese motivation the potential is there but but but probably we should expect an some sort of agreement to be announced and then it not to work very well that's a great Point Dereck let me also ask you about something that Ana Manuel last hour said she would take as a sign of a big breakthrough wasn't saying it was going to happen but if it did and that was kind of the re-engagement of military talks between both sides that have been suspended since Pelosi's visit over there How likely would that be either from this Summit or at all in the near future I I think that's possible the the whole Biden Administration pitch this year here and and Unice talked about it and you guys talked about it a second ago is to try to improve communication between the US and China now what they won't say the b Administration isn't going to say this is they're worried that Xi Jinping is isolated in terms of information that he's not being told things about the world that he needs to know because basically everyone's afraid of him um you know he puts people in power and then they disappear a few months later this has happened repeatedly this year so it's a genuine us concern that we need to try to communicate with she instead of going through under Lings who may or may not tell him what's going on um we communicated that to the Chinese they're at least having this meeting so there's a chance that that more direct military Communications will come out of it it's certainly a goal of the administration within the broader goal of we need to be able to get to Xi Jinping himself and not people that were not sure are going to tell him what's going on Derek how important even from an economic perspective is this uh mid East conflict this war going on and these two leaders talk at this point about perhaps improving communication well I mean it's the mid East conflict obviously has a lot of really important Dimensions I don't know that it matters very much for the US it potentially matters more for China because they're much more oil and gas dependent uh than the US is in terms of imports um I don't think right now they see a major threat but they do see a problem there I think um what they'd like is for the US to say we'll take care of it somehow they don't want to be directly involved they want us to do it us to protect their access to oil um so that's their hope I don't think something like that is going to come out of the summit I think that's that's very difficult cooperation for the two countries so I think that you know what's going to happen in the Middle East and its many dimensions the econ Dimension the economic dimension for China is going to continue to be something that they have to worry about", "aigc_title": "AEI's Derek Scissors on the Unlikelihood of

"video_transcript": "Susan Mills Kim Dixon Lisa hi and joining us at the table is Adam Miller from Heaven Hill Distillery hi Adam thank you for having you so much we are really excited so you are our first guest in something we are calling Charelle is not cooking for Thanksgiving so one of the things about me is I have made Thanksgiving twice okay and it was a nightmare experience uh I stood up I cooked for like 8 to 12 hours I was exhausted I was sleep deprived and then people had the nerve to critique my food and I said I will never do this again I said I will only buy things so all this week uh we're going to be highlighting businesses food products things like that that people can give for Thanksgiving if they're like me and they've sworn off cooking so uh one of the things that some folks just absolutely cannot do Thanksgiving with because they cannot stand their relatives is a little little little something little libation so uh so you are with Heaven Hill Distillery tell us about The Distillery yes so Heaven Hill we've uh been around since 1935 so uh one of the Legacy Brands here in Kentucky been making bourbon down in uh Bardstown in Louisville for quite some time um but very much family-owned company um we've made all our own juice we don't really Source anything so that's a that's a positive in the industry and uh you know we we always f Fus on kind of the bars and restaurants and uh our partners in the off- premise and just providing a good quality product for affordability so um which this day and age is bourbon can be expensive so we always like to offer something that people can find and uh it's also really good yeah that's really cool so you've been making it since 1935 correct you make your own juice you said so what else makes your product so special um well being here in Kentucky one um you know the unique climate uh you know when bourbon goes into the barrel it's clear um as it ages it picks up this uh this beautiful amber color that you're seeing in the bottles um but did going back to the climate yeah so it gets cold and hot you know we all know kuy's weather it changes daily um but that really has a big effect on the spirit going in and out of the wood and it gives it a lot of those uh flavors and uh the color you're see I mean everything about Kentucky makes a difference our client everything all of the things you just descri so let's do a little let's do a little pour you have something for us here so um which one are we tasting today we are going to taste Elijah Craig small batch which is one of our um yeah one of our main Flagship Brands um it's also the official bourbon of the PGA Tour it's coming to Valhalla the PJ championship in May and uh Elijah Craig will be out there so so tell us what we're smelling what we're tasting what it's made out of we want to know everything yeah so the mash bill on these two it's actually I brought these two uh specifically they have the same Mash bill which means uh the the grains basically the recipe that goes into it um it's 78% corn um that'll add a lot of the sweetness to it um it has 10% Rye in it which adds a little bit of the spice I can that R yep it nice well balanced um and then 12% malti barley which is used in a lot of the fermentation uh basically to help round out everything so fantastic okay so you mentioned that Thanksgiving is coming up um what products would you recommend that people pick up before the holiday well these two in front of you I would definitely recommend um this one on the right the Heaven Hill bottled in bond that's a seven-year and it's a 100 Proof so it's a little bit it has to there's some unique regulations with quality standards with the bottled in bond um so we meet all of those that's one expression and then of course the Elijah Craig um you know if you're looking for a nice oldfashioned or you know it's a little cold and you need the Kentucky hug which is what they call Kentucky hug I love it love it um you can go for the Elijah Craig small batch and uh it's found pretty much everywhere so both of these can be found anywhere so when you say bottled in bond what does that mean uh it's basically a quality standard m um so it has to be 100 Proof um it has to be aged for at least 4 years um it has to be distilled by uh one Distillery and shown on the label which is right there on the front um and where it's distilled and bottled and uh it has to be a product of one distillation season so either spring or fall and uh think I knew that and then it has to be aged in a government Bonded Warehouse so basically the bottled and bond act back in the late 1800s guarant quality and uh it's a pillar of our portfolio so we like to Showcase yeah absolutely and as far as cocktails what is your favorite cocktail mixing with these it's uh it's hard to go wrong with an oldfashioned with Elijah Craig um we had old fashioned week a few weeks ago it's a big National incentive that Elijah Craig does we like to partner with our on premise uh folks and bars and restaurants and uh yeah a good old fashioned with Elijah Craig small batch uh that's your call little simple syrup little bits you can muddle the orange and Cherry in there if you want um will not go wrong if you party with that for me it's extra cherries like put a bunch in there that makes it really good so you keep saying on premise tell us about that do you have something special there at the facility uh no no no no on premise means the bars and restaurants where you injust off- premise means where you buy it at like your Liquor Bar your and take it home with you see you're we're you're having to teach us your way all all no apologies well I had never had this before it's we one thing we love on this show is something that's a

conversations about race with racial healing practitioners like Kevin Fong and Monica hasset in Washington DC we met Ryan DN and in Birmingham Alabama we met Erica AI they've never met but they've lived only miles from each other in a state with a reputation of racial [Music] tension going to sit right there tell me about your family and their story I come from a family of of Vietnamese La refugees they're they're known as boat people um from The Exodus of 1978 and there are 21 of them in my family and the government placed my dad and his seven brothers and their parents in Massachusetts so I have that um network of support but my mom's side of the family in Hawaii wow you're originally your parents of from Ghana right there were just a Sprinkle of of West African families or African families uh in the community uh Ghana was strong but we had community members from Liberia from the Civil War some Nigerians there as well so I think with my parents it was how can we create our community an African Community and this larger community of people of a larger White Community as a child of West African immigrants things were very new and my parents are a little older so having to explain like why I needed $100 for a prom dress or what is a prom th those normal uh transitions in American Childhood my parents didn't have those things they grew up differently so those those moments of Celebration within age so having to explain those things to my parents sometimes was challenging and I took dance classes after school and you know my old school you know African dad oh just dance in the basement he didn't understand why you have to pay you know for more classes of course there are misinterpretations of your culture and your background and your heritage especially being Southeast Asian that was a culture people were not familiar with and so I'd always be lumped in with the Chinese kids or the Korean kids um always mistaken in terms of who I was and how did that feel to you to sort of did you try to more fit in with them I think for me I was always embracing of my heritage and my blood and my roots just because I had such a strong Foundation growing up um understanding where my family comes from and the rich uh diverse stories um were affiliated with but so it never really bothered me um or got to me um I'd always hold my ground but when I started to see my younger brother go through the same school systems um meet the same people walk the same hallways as me and see signs or or symptoms of not wanting to be who he was that's when it started to hit me as I was growing up and making friends black friends white friends especially my my dancer friends and would bring um friends over to my parents house I was always the house that had that goat meat smell right or too much Pepper or or the cow fooot our house you know smelled like a West African home and then you know what does that smell and to me it would smell appetizing um but to somebody else it would smell you know horrendous um and then when you eat it it's all good you know um I never let it bring me down you know I never felt uh embarrassed or uncomfortable because I was that that that was my identity tell me about a time when you realize your race mattered I think it was always something unspoken we never had like a sit down in which we we were told oh this is what you look like to to other kids and this is what you should do there was never a conversation of of that nature in any way and so it's kind of kind of like you figure it out um as you as you live life with us West African parents they never really experienced racism wow because they're coming from a continent where everybody looks like youh and then to be in Boston and have issues of race was very new for my parents um I know especially from my dad when he first came to the states he came to Washington DC in the 70s and he said he didn't even know like really the word racism and just a feeling that you were being treated different differently and as immigrants who do you go to talk to especially in those days there was no Dei or you know who do you talk to about I feel differently and I'm not even sure I feel I'm being treated differently is it racism is it not racism and then Massachusetts where everything's covered they don't want you to think it's racism and it really is those were certainly uh challenges growing up yeah so how are you uh received by the black community it was challenging and at times I wasn't always sure if we were on the same page we shared the same skin color but were our backgrounds really the same uh beyond our skin color kind of you know always consistently trying to to to build build that bridge um and being a part of different after school clubs with Africans with with African-Americans and kind of sharing our backgrounds individually and making sure that we are on the same team because at the end of the day we're in a larger uh White Community um and so we will have the same battles of race if there's an issue of racism someone's not going to say oh it's different for you because you're African or it's different for you because you're you're black American it's not we have to we really have to come together and and fight the battle together I think I've always felt small microaggressions or acts of racism all throughout my life not just recently but it definitely intensified during the co 19 pandemic what did that look like well apart from the the feeling the trauma of the the Relentless news and the barrage of hate crimes happening across the country my my own family was impacted my mom who works as a um a realtor a neighbor of one of her properties called her racist slurs and there's another instance in which my aunt's nail salon was vandalized and of course being Asian-American in largely non- Asian-American communities we couldn't help but think that our race our ethnicity was a factor mhm mhm how did that make you feel all of these Collective instances made me feel awful I felt powerless helpless but mostly I was hurting um hurting for my my parents for my aunts and uncles my grandparents every every single Asian um immigrant migrant worker who had sacrificed their own dreams um in pursuit of a better life here and they worked so hard hard so hard to to escape War uh to come to country that tried to guarantee them peace and safety I feel like those are not big ass peace and safety but they couldn't even be afforded that basic right and so it was a bit of hurt and it was also a bit of anger it's always like been the outside oh Boston's you know one of the most racist places in America but do bostonians say that you know for themselves and I think they're owning starting to own that um themselves mhm and trying in some ways to dismantle it so there's small little pockets and then using social media to bring these Pockets together because there's a mix of different races but it's not integrated yeah it's like Chicago We're very segregated and you know it's the separation right that creates that constant opportunity and it makes people leave [Music] ISS I decided to to organize on March 13 2021 we held the stop Asian hate Boston rally in March which was attended by close to a thousand people of all colors and backgrounds and ages and it was a really beautiful site to see because it showed me that I was not alone in this um which I had felt for so long during the Pand mic half the speakers during our rally that day weren't even Asian-American they they came from the black community from the Latino Community the undocumented make it a point that hate against one is hate against all and unless we band together unless we build allly ships we are not going to to dismantle this I firmly believe that we can end racism within our lifetime that's what keeps me going what are a couple of things you can personally do to help end racism within our lifetime I think no matter what I do as long as I'm being I'm acknowledging that racism is occurring it contributes to to dismantling it so it doesn't even have to be on the ground protesting or organizing like I did during the pandemic um it can be more subtle in terms of just writing and capturing the stories and and the issues that are pervading them one of my last questions and favorite questions to ask is you know do you believe that racism or ending racism is possible I'm not sure if any of these ISM ideologies ending them is possible I think we just have to continue to have very uncomfortable courageous conversations to breakthrough racism it will always be there it's not just thinking it's it's it's in policy it's an infrastructure it's in housing it's it's it's systematic and it's embedded in the psyche of America we have to be uncomfortable and have uncomfortable conversations changing the narrative starts with sharing stories share your story with us thank you very

That's more than a 30% increase from 2021, and 10 ...", "video_transcript": "well the number of babies born with syphilis in the US is skyrocketing the CDC says more than 3700 newborns had congenital syphilis last year an mvi talked to an infectious disease specialist at Stanford about the disease and the problems it can cause for newborns so syphilis is an age-old disease it has been with Humanity for as long as we have been able to record diseases in people um however over the last several decades we have been very successful in almost erratic syphilis it's a bacterial disease it is primarily a sexually transmitted infection and it's actually in general easily treated with Penicillin when it's when it is identified and treated properly what we are seeing now of course with is an incidence uh increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections overall in the general population and with that what we're starting you see as well is syphilis and Gara making uh resurgences in our overall population and so what happens is that includes women who have uh relationships sexual relationships and can also go under their infections with syphilis gonorrhea and other STDs can also go undetected and so now what we're seeing is a result of this particularly with syphilis which can really have very devastating effects on uh new born infants so what problems could have caused a newborn well um there is something called congenital syphilis which can lead to um infection in the uterus and during the period of U pregnancy um and which can lead to many many bone joint heart eye uh brain uh diseases infections uh and which can leave permanent scars if not treated as soon as possible so tell us about uh some more of the findings of of the study I mean how bad is this problem well um let me tell you from a population standpoint um in 2012 so just about 11 years ago we had reached a low level of 335 cases of identified congenital syphilis in the United States and last year that number was 10 times highered over 3,700 cases and that may unfortunately be the tip of the iceberg because there may have been not uh not complete diagnosis of all newborn babies and so from a population standpoint we're just facing more and more children who are being identified with syphilis at Birth now this is something as I mentioned that we had really gotten under control and we're ready to really think about uh eliminating this disease because you have to really test every pregnant woman uh to make sure she doesn't have cus during pregnancy and then treat her to make sure that she she gets cured but also the she does not transmit the infection to her baby and that's where the problem lies so is problem there go ahead problem sorry you go ahead no problem so is it safe to treat syphilis during pregnancy once it is identified absolutely um there are there essentially penicillin is the treatment for pregnant women and again there are concerns of course in the occasional people who are allergic to penicillin can't get the normal treatment uh so that can be a problem but that's where uh Public Health officials and clinicians can actually engage in understanding how to monitor and treat those people but the majority of individuals who are pregnant who have syphilis can be treated easily the problem is that uh lies in three areas number one um as we've seen in the last 10 years um the numbers have gone up tenfold but 90% of the people who were whose babies were identified With A congenital syphilis were never tested or adequately treated for syphilis during their pregnancy and it's best to treat it during pregnancy because when the baby is born they may actually wind up having very severe manifestations of this infection that affects virtually every organ of their body uh which can leave a longlasting lifetime scars and developmental problems as well as death in some cases now um it can be treated um in the newborn and the child but again it's much better to treat during pregnancy so the number one issue is 90% of women who had have were diagnosed with conal syphilis baby babies in 2022 uh were either not tested during pregnancy because they didn't have prenatal care or because they were tested in inadequately and not treated appropriately okay so we have testing treatment and of course prevention is usually the best way to go about this U the CDC study mentioning some Miss prevention opportunities what are they referring to there well um we have always had in place well not always but for many decades we've had in place opportunities to test women for syphilis during their prenatal visits the problem is as you probably know is we have many women now who don't have access to prenatal care and that's a really big problem not just for the syphilis issue but for other issues as well keeping those pregnant people healthy and able to carry a full-term healthy baby as well as keeping themselves healthy and so the lack of prenatal care in some areas of the country are a real concern especially with the lack of public health infrastructure that we've seen after the pandemic so that's one area is testing the second is treatment um you as I mentioned you ideally you would want to treat a pregnant person who has the FIS during pregnancy and sometimes if you're not diagnosed or diagnosed and don't come back for treatment that doesn't happen um many uh what we're seeing now in many of these cases that these women never had prenatal care and were diagnosed either either when the baby was born or we look back and find out that they actually had a a visit or two in emergency department and emergency departments are not where you have long-term care and so people fall through the cacks they don't get tested they don't get treated um if they get treated you need to monitor very carefully and that doesn't always happen either so this is really a disease of social demographic uh inadequacy resource inadequacy and inadequacy of Public Health infrastructure all right well getting this information out there is an important first step to trying to fix this Dr Ivon Maldonado with Stanford Healthcare

adorable felines who are looking for their forever home yes thank you for bringing them and who do we have here okay this is Michael okay Michael that is Cole and that is Carrie Carrie Carrie and this is just the names that we name them you know when you get them you can name them whatever you want when you name a thousand cats we kind of start to run on names um a little backstory about and Michael here is they were found in a dumpster in Shellsburg at the um trailer park um so somebody left six of them to die uh we had a great person that found them got them out they needed some health care and stuff they were in pretty rough shape when we got them but they're doing really really good now um they seem like people we have a couple of them that are still a little bit timid but they really like some attention Michael yeah I know and I would say I think these guys are about 8 10 weeks old okay Cole's a little bit older he's come from um unfortunately a problem where people keep dumping animals out in the country and then poor people try to take care of them so we're helping with the TNR problem there and trying to get it under control okay you know if people would be responsible and get their pets Bay neutered we wouldn't have this problem it is and there's just so many places that help now so many organizations that help so there's more options than dumping and oh yeah leaving them to die which is horrible I know it just breaks and we have a place right on Sixth Street um that they spay a neuter pets for really reasonable prices I mean cats and dogs and if it's a last a feroc cat it's only $25 and then you can bring them in that morning pick them up that night um you know that just saves you know how one cat can have numerous numerous litters of kittens and then they all suffer on the street and die so and we can't you know adopt our way out of this we've got to get some pet control here so how many cats and kittens do you have in your care right now um I know we have under hundreds but right now actually I think the spade and neuter they've been doing for 10 years is starting to help because we don't have near animals kittens that we used to have we have a lot of great adult senior cats too if you're going to get a kitten I really really recommend adopting two because they need to entertain each other like stuff less they'll get into less trouble they're toddlers remember that they're little toddlers you know and they get in trouble and they get bored and you know they need some activity and if you want something a little calmer we have some awesome older cats you know even over a year or too old they start to calm down a little bit the first year where can people go to learn more about um we have a Saint's um Facebook page okay so you can definitely go to there you can make an appointment to come on Saturday to visit the cats okay um we have the applications for adoption online also okay do you are you looking for any volunteers for well we always have volunteers because we run solely on volunteers so we clean twice a day we need cleaners um we need people to Foster okay you know there's all kinds of needs okay so there's the holidays coming up do you have some events that you'll be participating in to kind of get these animals out a little more you know I'm not aware of yet any events that we have we do B sales at our place and different things like that for fundraisers we also take donations food um you know toys all those kind of things for the cats okay you can always drop them off okay oh my gosh you guys are so sweet you're very active though aren't you he's like yeah know it's okay though so I know you mentioned like adopting kitties together and I have a a cat he's 10 now but you know he's used to having other animals and now he doesn't so now he wants to like wrestle with me and he does like he'll want to rough out cuz he just wants to play so I don't think they ever quite grow out of that until they get really old so I think having two is a really good who does like to have a partner I know right you know I mean it's lonely why you are just spicy you just want down don't you little sweetie all right so if people want more information again they can get it at yeah just go to the Saints Facebook page okay okay yep all right yes volunteer donate supplies adop or Foster a kid

law Brandy joins us now from the too Bar Association to talk more about these events welcome thank you so uh there actually it's actually a bus this bus rolls into town or is this bus does this bus make the Rounds Around Ohio or what's the deal yes it's the Ohio Justice bus um it's sponsored by the Ohio access to Justice foundation and it travels throughout the entire State throughout the year throughout the Year yes we we arranged for it to come to Lucas County somewhere in toled um once each quarter um so we've seen it I think in August was the last time but so the lawyers on the bus are they are they law students are they experienced lawyers or what what's the mix here they're experienced lawyers um and they are available to help us out um when they come to a a city like Toledo or another big City they usually have um they work with the bar associations and we recruit our own attorneys um who just know more about our specific courts within Lucas County um but they're there to provide support as well now pro bono work or free services is that something you're all required to do or you just feel like a social obligation to do it or how does that all work the Ohio Supreme Court says that lawyers that are licensed in Ohio do have an obligation to do free free uh legal services not all lawyers do it there is no requirement it's just strongly advised so how in fact if you have a law practice how would you how would you do that if someone comes to you and you go realize that they're they're not real they're they don't have Deep Pockets you just feel like you know what we'll let you slide here right well we work with um other organizations um legal we legal aid of Western Ohio is um the big one the big legal aid Society for Western Ohio and there's certain standards that the people have to meet to qualify for um free legal services uh so what kind of uh services does the bus provide so U what kind of questions are they pretty typical stuff uh maybe like issues with rent uh a problem with the landlord things like that or maybe my employer right this specific um Clinic that we're having tomorrow is supposed to be focused on consumer issues so if people have questions about their bills um about a debt that they owe uh a collection action or even bankruptcy and just want to know their options our lawyers that are going to be volunteering tomorrow actually have experience in those areas um but we have had other uh brief advice Justice bus clinics that focused more on family law issues so divorce and custody um and we really actually see a a wide variety because no one has just one question obviously everyone has a lot of legal questions so um we try to accommodate whatever the people come in and and ask about well yeah in aot a lot of cases there's no simple answer to your question on that yeah you come with this problem and like well you could do this this this this or this and of course it it's hard to get all the facts about a situation you there's a lot of nuances to it that that only that person would know and it's hard to make a a good suggestion for that exactly and there's usually many different issues that are so interconnected and one problem leads to another problem that you know sometimes you just need to talk through it so the Justice bus tell me about it's going to come in tomorrow it's going to be where and how long it's going to be at the West Toledo branch of the library um which is on West Sylvania um it'll be there between 10: and 12 we're actually going to have tables set up inside the library in the basement um and the to Lucas County Public Library is so gracious we've had these clinics every quarter for the last few years at different Library locations um and they're really really nice to provide that for us um so no one has to stand out in the cold or the rain and wait for services um don't have to climb into the bus unless you really want to and everyone's welcome to come out and see the bus because it is pretty pretty nice so how many people typically would come out on a given day 50 or more than that not usually that many um for our CL CLS that are like a 2hour clinic we usually see anywhere from 10 to 30 people um I've been to larger clinics hosted by other organizations um with the Justice bus that did have 75 to 100 people but they were um focused on a really broad range of issues okay so the free legal clinic the Justice bus is coming it'll be at the uh Sylvania Avenue library from 10:00 a.m. to noon tomorrow yes it registration needed or just show up just show up all right Brandy

up on operation turkey.com and spend either Wednesday uh time with us smoking the turkeys or cooking the sides or on Thursday Thanksgiving morning just delivering the meals and having a great time and creating a great memory so do you need you don't need a chef's license to do this anyone can do this absolutely it we take L Dy everybody and so if if uh we take the kiddos as well so remember when you were a kid and you used to uh trace the the turkey that I you guys like the one drawing I can still do no I've done it now as an adult I've done it as an adult we're going to have the kids and the the the kids at heart do that on Wednesday and in a clean environment decorate what we call the clamshells those to go containers okay and then uh we also cook and prepare all the food on Wednesday so from 6:00 a.m. until we get it done Y and then uh the next morning at 6:00 a.m. we start that chain and we start putting all the food together we play uh Christmas music we have DJs that come in we have um high schools we have Civic organizations but those people who don't have anywhere else to go come to our Island of Misfit Toys and join us what does it mean to the families that you help I mean you've done it for many years now what kind of stories do you hear from people that's where it's so heartwarming because I grew up in a small farming Community where we knew just about everybody and after my father died in the line of duty um we didn't have much but we had family and just about every great memory that I can remember centered around food and so when Hector and I learned about operation turkey we wanted to do more and make sure that we are inclusive to everyone and delivering that food instead of just going to a Civic Center and those are great where they give you know ice cream scoop of potatoes right but we give you that meal so you can have it in the sanctity of your own home and share it with your friends and family members and you'll transfer it out of the U the the the plastic and put it on your nice um China or whatever plates that you have warm it up and then just share those memories that's so amazing you guys are really the extra mile and the extra step and this is my favorite type of volunteering because it people always wonder how can I get involved how can I help what can I do you really just need to donate your time which is precious and it's so valuable but look this is where operation turkey locations you can go volunteer dates here November 22nd 23rd they're all over town Katie Elks Lodge American Legion Post American Legion Post and Spring Branch Pasadena St Paul's United Methodist Church guys um you'll find one near year absolutely can sign up and that's a cute little clam shells that the kids that was one of the ones yes it I

walk beside and uh to just do whatever we do to make our SE a better place to live work and play uh this is some of the stuff that the human rights do uh each year we hold two main events one of them is usually in Spring it's our youth award uh the picture there is this year's youth award I believe we had 42 youth that receive award for making uh a difference in our community this is youth that are the future generation of our city and they go above and beyond to do things that change somebody's life or make a difference in our community so that's always a a fun event we have that at Hilton and there dinner you know and uh we hear some amazing Stories and the second award we do it's what we call the human rights award this is actually uh it was just last month in October here I believe it was October 19 and we had amazing people incredible story this is truly people are human rights Champions that live work and play here on our communities um I encourage you guys to go to our website read some of the Amazing Stories of the incredible uh contribution these people that were presenting this award are making in our uh human right commission we also do hold uh some activities the that challenges the community think differently or challenges the community to learn new things uh one of our big campaign was in the fall of 2022 we had a campaign called implicit bias challenge which we encourage member of the community to take the Harvard implicit B uh bias uh test there's so many of them you can take them and uh then we ask people what they learn from it they didn't have to give us their score they just had to tell us what they learn from me we had some uh community members uh City Council Members school board and just many Community leaders that took the challenge and we published all those information it was just uh learning about your own bias we all have bias and uh learning about it it makes us better people because we know how we can act on that so if you are still interested those information out there you can look for them uh we also uh sponsor one of the movie at the FI scene the movie called till if you have not seen this movie I will encourage you to go see it it's truly a life changing movie uh it's just an amazing uh story a sad story if you haven't seen it yet uh look for it just make sure you have some tissue with you so um in other many other activity we do we are part of pretty much every uh events that happens in Iowa City uh you can see our commissioner below there at the pride festivals uh I think the one on top it was June 10th and in another one was so we we do promote on every uh event that happens in our city we want to make sure that we are part of it and uh teaching and sharing information about the human rights and uh the things that happens in our city so uh we as human rights we feel it's important to take uh to take a stand on some issue that happens our community our states or our nation so whenever there's a issue that it's deep in um our heart or in human rights we make sure that we put our statement uh we put out a statement in 2020 uh when we we talking about after the murder of uh uh our uh africanamerican we made sure that we put our statement over there so uh those are things that we do usually couple commissioner will come together we work on a state we have it we take it to the group and we approve it and we put our statement so that was uh George Floyd statement that we put after the March of uh black Liv matter in 2020 uh we also put out another statement after the major reversal of Ro v Wade we put out a statement and just uh promoting human right making sure that you know people have their right we believe in those things so we make sure that we stand up for what we believe in and what's right uh recent uh we also did put out a statement on uh I don't know if many of you knew that we had some uh situation Iowa City at story time at the library where we do some drug uh people in drug they tell story and we have some protest that was more of intimidation and uh so we wanted to make sure that we put a statement under and uh stand up for what's right so uh the most recent statement we put out to was you know after the war that we are all seeing right now between Israel and Hamas and what's going on in Palestine so we put out a statement on that as well uh we just want to make sure that people are safe people are treated well and uh there's peace around the world and this is not to put one one country down or the other group down it's more of a just respecting human right human rights are basic rights great so I'm gonna come in now um if I can also advance slides while speaking let's try there we go hi everybody I'm Kelsey PA Shan um I work with Roger on the Human Rights Commission as a human rights commissioner um and so now we're just going to transition into speaking about uh the racial equity and social justice Grant opportunity which is what I assume you're all here uh to hear more about and to get a bit more information on so um just a little bit of background of why this is available where this comes from so in 2017 city council created the racial Equity social and social justice Grant you might see that referred to as rej in the descriptions as well as the materials that's what we mean when we use rej J um and they created this grant to assist community- based organizations in building capacity to address racial equity and social justice needs so in 2024 there is a total pool of $100,000 that's already been allocated from the city budget so city council as well as the entire city um of Iowa City's department and city manager really have this fits within the Strategic values and the strategic framework so there's four different aspects of the community's the city's uh strategic plan involving housing and neighborhoods the economy safety and wellb sa excuse me safety and well-being and mobility and so this Grant application sits within um within that strategic plan uh recent recipients of the racial equity and social justice Grant include um many of the organizations that you see here um um I just want to make a plug for one because their um their Grant they're using actually is for an event this Friday night that is um truth giving uh which is um uh hosted by uh the Great Plains action Society and also they they're partnering with the enger theater so if you can make that I think that's great but the the recipients really vary in their application interests um we've also um supported um the food banks being able to have indigenous food items um local to Native cultures and in the sense of native cultures from wherever someone might move to Iowa City from uh so there's a wide array of different types of uh grants that are reviewed and in some cases successful uh here is a photo spread of some of the racial equity and social justice Grant recipients um and you can see them with the large checks and I think actually this is a good uh indication too of the spread of the amounts of money that are approved for each Grant so if you look closely I think you might see um some of the different amounts that are a part of um those recipients so when we think about um racial Equity what we mean is um a process of eliminating racial disparities and improving outcomes for everybody so an intentional intentional and continual practice of changing policies practices systems and structure structures by prioritizing measurable change particularly in the lives of people of color and when we speak about social social justice what we mean is fair and Equitable division of resources opportunities as well as privileges in society so as Roger already um alluded to human rights are rights inherent to all human beings regardless of their race sex nationality ethnicity language religion or any other status and that really is the backbone of the racial equity and social justice grants so um we do have some areas of focus uh that we require or ask all applicants to consider and to also uh evaluate themselves and whether their uh fits within these areas these include building communities criminal justice education employment health and housing um there are also some technical requirements uh and you'll recognize a QR code on the left of the screen if you hold up your camera app on your phone over that Q code it should link uh it should open to a link where you can see more details on this but obviously all the materials are online too so [Music] um some of the requirements include that the organization must be physically located in Iowa City the project must take place in Iowa City it should seek to eliminate in inequity in the community whether this is at the individual institutional or structural level the project must be a new project and um there is an exception to this which is that organizations that were just funded in the last Grant cycle May reapply for the same project to be funded under this next cycle uh applicants cannot be uh governments public schools and colleges or universities applicants can request excuse me no more than $25,000 us and projects cannot be for fundraising purposes so some of the things that we invite you to consider when deciding on a project that you might like to um submit an application about um to the racial equity and social justice Grant application process include what are the priorities of the organization um are there indicators that there are gaps or needs and services um or programs that the that the organization is uniquely placed to address is there any data that you can include uh on community trends that demonstrate this gap or need and then if yes um we invite you to develop an action plan that answers uh a few key questions first as referenced what is the identified Gap or need what is it specifically for example that you hope to make change on related to racial equity and social justice and and a gap that no one else is working on or achieving right now second how can the organization mitigate the gap or need so for those that are part of the Grant application process or those that you represent how are you uniquely positioned in order to address that Gap third what supports are needed so resourcing specifically uh what kinds of materials books uh food items all the different things um that might be needed in order to carry out your project and fourth how can success be ensured so are there other partners that you plan to work with in reaching your success are there other needs that you'll need so maybe this is a partial Grant request but there's additional funding that will be necessary maybe it requires organizing volunteers or making sure that the right people in your organization have time to work on the project just for example um there are a few tips that uh we want to recommend as you're building your applications uh this includes that when filling out the application please make sure that you're clearly communicating the background and the goals of the project uh we do want to get to understand and know uh your organization or your reason of why why are you doing this work uh that's a really helpful thing for us to be able to know and for anyone who's reviewing the grants uh once you have filled out the application we invite you to save it and have someone unfamiliar with the project look it over proofread it check it for grammatical Clarity but also check that it makes sense to an outside audience and that you've met all the guidelines we invite you to be clear and specific about the outcomes so um if you believe that your project F fills a gap we make progress on racial equity and social justice in our community please show us how you think that it will reach the intended audiences and the kind of impact that it might be able to have um on those audiences or participants in the project and be specific about some of those outcomes uh we this is an interesting bullet point because I think there is so much need um but we do recommend that you don't ask for more than you need so um that includes you know having a clear budget of these are the resources that will be necessary and the maximum then request is based on the resources necessary in order to fulfill the project um so that we're able to fund multiple projects uh within each Grant cycle um we do want to mention that partial funding might be recommended if uh when looking at the budget it appears that the project can be completed with less funding and then finally the commission will factor into its decision-making whether an organization has previously or will in the future receive funding from the city for any projects uh and when I say will in the future I mean in the immediate term like if you have already um been selected or are part of a grant recipient process with the city um obviously we're not predicting into the future whether or not you might receive funding from the city and then as a final tip before I pass it back over to Roger um we just want to mention that um some sometimes you know we would um really hate for any of your progress in the application to be lost and so as you go through the online application please go ahead and keep a Word document open or any other um a word processing document open to copy and paste in both the questions and your responses that way that you can always have it saved uh on your own device uh so that if anything happens with your web browser um you don't lose you know potentially hours of your your time and your work all right uh I'm going to come back and just talk about you know few of the review process that we use so when we get this uh application um Stephanie she's amazing and she keeps us all looking good they where she we we get all the application in the booklet and all nine member of the commission then they get those booklets to review your application so just think about it there's so many great uh organization in Iowa City there's so many amazing group of uh uh doing some amazing work so make sure that we can understand your application when we are reading it make us learn about your organization through your application because uh you know make sure your mission is there your vision is there that way we Grant we we we rate your application on based on all the information that we are asking so we have a rubric that we actually revise those last year doing our strategic planning to kind of simplify so we can make sure that the application process wasn't it wasn't complicated and it was easy to understand and also the rating of that was easy as well so this is kind of our uh racial Equity social justice uh Grant rubric that we use so uh we just want to know we want to understand your project like Kelsey said you know the city allocated $100,000 and we want to make sure that it gets used to the best way to promote racial Justice and um uh racial uh social social justice and racial Equity with the project that you propose and uh I believe uh this is how we Grant the application this is actually for last round you know we only had $100,000 but we got $329,000 worth of request so we want to make sure that we alloc marting that the best way we we know we can do it so we find the average everybody uh kind of rates your application and we come together in one big meeting and we we discuss you know why did you do this and why did you really it like that so it's very important to us to make sure that we are we find a happy medium and making sure that the money that we giving each organization will be put into good on the timeline so start early uh late application are not review so we're not going to get any late application uh the grant links to apply will be open December 1st and you have about a month to get that done and uh then uh through uh January 5th the human R commissioner will send recommendation to the city council we usually send it for approval during the March 31st meeting and the money is available to you on June 1st so with the this grant you're not getting money little by little you get the whole L sum right in front so we can make sure that your project is successful and you get it done then after that then uh we get quality report quarterly reports and things like that so start early uh finish your application review it like El you say have somebody else that doesn't know your organization review it to see if it makes sense to them and they get it to us on January 5th uh you know before we even talk about keeping in touch with us if you are selected as one of the uh guantee the human right will also assign you a commissioner to be your leers on somebody that will talk to you will keep up with you we'll come to the event to make sure that uh you are getting support besides just having our Equity Department supporting you you're going to have the whole commission supporting you as well to make sure that your project is successful and we also like to promote your project so if you're having an event it's a project you send us that information we make sure we're promoting on all of our social media not only from the equity division or the human rights uh social media but our personal social media as well so connect with us uh stay in touch this is how you can best connect with us and uh we like to kind of open it up to question if anybody has any question that we can uh help clarify things or give some guidance how you doing yes can you hear me or am I slow we can hear you okay I can hear okay um as some of y'all of course I do the news and we on our own streaming networks how we go about getting involved in what you guys are doing to cover some of the things you're doing as we do uh get involved with a lot of communities across the US when it come impacting social justice when it comes to uh dealing with human rights and the differences because our goal with our media is to show the difference cities what's going on but also the positiveness that is going on in the cities and I don't think the if the concept grows on what we're doing we're trying to get each City and give them time on the network so other people understand what's going on and hopefully it Inspire other cities to come aboard and do something too so how would we go about um getting information from you guys and if you are having meetings such as this right here if it's going to go out or you have some other Zoom meetings that we can get and put on them who we need to speak um yes so we have a human right coordinator Stephanie Bower um she's usually the connection to all the Commissioners so any information you need or you can always reach out to Stephanie Bower at the city of Iowa City and she will connect you to all of our events all of our meetings all of our anything you need to know about uh the human right commission Stephanie B can guide you and we also have our uh on page with the city of IA City website as well too that kind have all of our events coming up so but Stephanie B will be the best person because she's our uh human right coordinator uh with the city of Iowa C okay I spoke with her on [Music] yesterday uh may I ask how long has this been going on uh what the Iowa City Human right commission actually we just celebrating our 60 years so this is 60 and there's only two other city that had the human right commission before us that was city of De Mo and city of devonport so this year we are celebrating 6 Z six year of uh doing amazing things in the community and I'm not trying to top your time I could get all that from her and if we wanted an interview and put a story together or something we get all that from Stephanie yes you can if there anybody still alive from the 60 years that was on the commission involved commiss well I that I don't know but I know there still there's a lot of past commissioner that are still involved in our community and still doing amazing things in our community so I don't know I have to do some research and ask Stephanie to see if we have any those original members thank you thank you any other questions we've got a question from Jen hi Jen hi um I have a a few questions actually um so um because of the size of the screen of my laptop I was kind of unable to see the pictures of past grantees but um I'm wondering uh if this grant is open to uh for-profits and nonprofits or nonprofits only uh the the grant is actually open to both okay so you can be a nonprofit Pro just depends on what project you are proposing okay and um and all the information that we presented today on the past Grant te it's also in our our website um and um our startup and running cost eligible for the grant uh there's a percentage that can be allocated to admin cost but most of uh the grants we really wanted to go toward programming or toward the actual project because we don't have that much money that we give us so you can get up to 25,000 but only percentage of that can be admin cost and uh I think when you're applying for the grant it it tells you that how much of the percentage if it doesn't you can always reach out to Stephanie B okay so I can pay the lighting Bill potentially that would be a good question for Stephen bar because you have to look at how much of that is considered admin cost so it depends on how much you're applying and what the percentage of that can be admin cost okay I have one more question um when you got Commissioners to join a commission would that have to be somebody that live in that state or what uh you know we look for people that actually living in the city of Iowa City and uh you know and we we I know we have mission that I work internationally they travel all over the place you know Kelsey just got back from Canada working and we have uh you know commission and I think probably week she's somewhere in the world working but they have to be kind of based in Iowa City and may I ask how often do the grants be given out is it once a year once a quarter we do the racial equity and social justice Grant once a year uh we do fund small project we have a a a small budget that we can uh we pay for sponsor or things like that but this grant it's once a year the city of Iowa City allocates $100,000 on their budget for this grant once a year and then in chat Stephanie has Linked In the web page where you can find more information about the Human Rights Commission initiatives um as well as specifically the racial equity and social justice Grant opportunity so that link is there for everyone um and Stephanie has given a great reminder that specifically just this Grant application process it was established in 2017 so the commission has been around for 60 years um but this grant process was established in the year 2017 um and um I I would say that since its Inception the value has increased yearly um sometimes significantly sometimes not um but currently we're able to Grant out $100,000 next year now I don't know how many people you have here so I don't want to take up a lot of your time but how would we go about covering some of the things you guys are doing that is awesome with some of the people who already have the previous grants that we can feature and help get the word out on what they're doing and what you guys are doing I mean I think that's a great question I think we probably just want to have a follow-up conversation um it sounds like you're already connected with Stephanie too um and so just so that we could um use our time tonight to maybe see if there's questions about those that maybe might be interested in the Grant application process I think maybe we'll just it would be wonderful to have a follow on conversation with you Anthony thank you thank you do we have any more question regarding the grant process or the Grant application we don't see any question you can always reach out to us if uh you think of something you think of a question later you can always reach out to uh Stephanie Bower at the city of Iowa City and that message can be passed on to us and uh we can help guide you or provide any feedback so so if there's no more question we like to give you your time back and I look forward to seeing your Grant application and reading your project and hopefully working side by side with you to keep making our city a better place to live yeah and I might just close by saying you know if you join the call tonight it's probably because you're already a mover and Shaker in our community and um you're already really interested and invested in making this the wonderful place that it is so and making it even better um for more people too so um just a note of encouragement uh if you have any questions about the application process if you um are not sure if your project qualifies as Roger mentioned um we're available to you um and again if you you'll find the link at that QR code as well that's on the page right now um but also you can just reach out our emails are online but also Stephanie has linked in her email in the chat here um so it's esow at ia- city.org um and Stephanie is amazingly responsive and can definitely help with any questions on this so thanks for joining tonight I hope

top a dangerous drive for a UPS truck driver Chopper four over the scene of a rollover crash this is along the Florida Turnpike heading southbound Florida Highway deputies say injuries have been reported no word yet on how many people were involved in that crash and another dangerous situation in Margate surveillance video catching the aftermath of a dangerous crash the driver of a truck slammed into a GameStop we are still working to find out the very latest so stay with us for any new developments always alerting always tracking this is next weather and and taking a live look outside we've got some clouds and a few showers today but we are tracking changes let's get right to next weather meterologist Cindy Pressler tracking it all ah NAA enjoy the nice weather while we have it oh there's some big changes starting tomorrow but really Wednesday into Thursday morning those are going to be the days that are really going to stand out we haven't seen rain like this in a very long time so enjoy the dry time right now 83 degrees we got a little bit of humidity out there clouds and some sunshine 81 at Homestead 881 at Fort Lauderdale temperatures are in the lower 80s down in the keys and a few showers not much but a few showers you can see the flow coming off the Atlantic kind of an East northeasterly flow so a few lighter showers through Broward County for Lauderdale area picking up some showers at this point a little bit more widely scattered down into Miami Dade but those little showers will continue for the next few hours for this evening little heavier rain that has gone through Coral Springs now it's down to am Merit Bank Arena across four 41 this is some heavier rain moving pretty quickly off to the Southwest at about 20 mph so these little showers are movers they're not just sitting and that wind a tight pressure gradient the difference between high pressure and low pressure is going to increase starting tomorrow our winds will be back 25 even 30 m per hour gusts especially Wednesday into Thursday morning so let's time out this rain for you this evening we'll have a few showers notice overnight this is by Tuesday at 7: a.m. we're still looking at a few showers this is not the main event though these are just a few showers tomorrow but notice starting to get a little bit heavier now as we head into Wednesday we'll start to see that moisture working its way up from the southwest we've got an area of low pressure in the gulf and something that could become tropical down in the Caribbean so a lot of moisture heading our Direction look at this we have not seen anything like this in many many uh weeks so looks almost like wet season doesn't it and this is why we've got a frontal system that's going to kind of sit around the area here but it's the of low pressure developing in the Gulf that will move to the north and east and eventually drag a front in that will pull that frontal system northward and then eventually a cold front so a lot of change coming up this week could see as much as two to four inches of rain that is possible heavier rain possible than that as well and down in the tropics we've got this area of low pressure that could become Vince we're going to be watching this making its way to the north and east so yes hurricane season we're still in it not done with it but the thing out of this is going to be mainly wind and rain Wednesday and Thursday these are going to be the tough days much better as we head into the weekend temperatures sitting in the low to mid 80s Cindy thank you Miami Dade County bus routes are getting a revamp CBS News Miami's Terry hornstein tells us what riters should know our team partnered with a local eacy group and went out to the community to

for 26 others and discontinuing 33 bus routes Al together that includes the 115 midn North Beach connector the only bus on Mii Beach that runs on the Bayside between Mount siai hospital and North Beach horrible it's not affordable for us it's not good for the workers all of these people got out four I need a bus please I need bus please not take a bus the county is Shifting resources to make this happen from low ridership routes to more popular ones but for some Riders it means losing their direct route their solution to us was that we should take a trolley and two buses to get to Mount Si to work but despite some frustration Transit staff says they believe the new system will help the Free Fair is to offer everyone a chance to adjust to the new schedules now the launch of these free

a two-step stop Gap measure to extend funding through January 19th for agencies including Transportation housing Agriculture and energy the other agencies including defense Homeland Security and state would be funded through February 2nd there's nothing magical or or mysterious about it it would just be effectively two phases already the plan is facing push back from some House GOP hardliners who are upset the proposal keeps funding at current levels and doesn't make Cuts Democrats have also criticized the plan calling it a recipe for more shutdowns and it does not include emergency aid for Israel Ukraine or the southern border setting the stage for a separate fight you veto the latter CR I'm not going to make a judgment what I'd veto what I'd sign but let's wait and see what they come

Stroud taking NFL by storm", "video_description": "Matt, Chuck, and Don discuss the firing of Jimbo Fisher at Texas A&M and who could possibly be in place to replace him.", "video_transcript": "sneakers and cleats the podcast welcome back towey I mean welcome back to sneakers and cleats podcast this is Monday November 13th uh this is episode 49 I'm Matt Roy that's Chuck this is Don um I you know you think about schwey every time we come in here now Seasons meetings so had to started out that way yeah Pete anyway this is episode 49 so 49 a little bit of a less notable number but people that I always think of Ron gidry who uh I think the anybody under 50 isn't thinking about but I Louisiana lightning Louisana lightning Ron G and we got Tim Wakefield who rip rest in peace to him he just passed away recently um too much of the uh controversy over Kurt Schilling on that one but anyway Chris S also 49 some good ones I uh I remember as a kid the Sports Illustrated cover when the um the 49ers beat the Bengals in the Super Bowl that was indoors in Detroit I think that was around 1980 79 something like that uh on the cover was a fullback scoring a touchdown for the 49ers named Earl Cooper who wore 49 that stuck in my head for some reason Earl Cooper yeah and then uh and the great Robby leg at the University of North Texas okay shout out to Robbie leg shout out to nor Texas right who got their asses kicked this past weekend but yeah 49 is not not common it's not a great it's not a huge number like you don't think like football players don't really have 49 like it's it's either a fullback or like some fifth safety or something like that for 49 some great player like LeBron should wear it to make it popular get wemi wemy wear 49 that'd be ugly yeah it's an ugly number it's is an ugly number all right we got a loaded slate for today so we we got a Cowboys and Texans both coming off some winning weekends uh CJ strad making his case for MVP now not just offensive rookie of the year he's a hell having a hell of a season but first we got to start with Jimbo we don't talk a lot of Texas A&M football on this program mainly because they suck all the time but uh Jimbo Fisher now fired after six years with the program they're going to pay him $76 million to get out of there um it's a nice paycheck to lose I mean I'm I'm down if you guys want to tell me to get the hell out of somewhere just like you see Ed oron thing a couple years ago and they let him go from LSU they're like you got $17 million left on your contract we're going to give it to you what D you what door you want me out of and when we get when can I leave so uh Jimbo Fisher it's the largest college football buyout in football history uh three mile yeah three times as big as the next one as Gus Malon I think it was at 21 so almost four times as big as the next one what else can be said about Jimbo guys biggest failure in college football well you know when Kevin sumlin left and eight and and was they fired him because he went eight and four eight and four eight and four and ends up having a better record than Jimbo in the exact same amount of time basically I said at the time now I there were other reasons they fired Kevin summon but I said if you're if you're in the SEC and you're firing a guy because he's eight and four what do you expect if you're Texas A&M now there's a difference between what you strive for and what you expect and I got into some trouble with some agie fans on Twitter yesterday because they misinterpreted a a tweet a bit and I should have clarified it better it's my fault but if you're A&M you should strive to be Alabama and Georgia no question about it and that should be your goal but if you expect to be Alabama and you see yourself in the mirror as Alabama as I think some of their boosters do then they had unre reasonable expectations for Jimbo I think in a lot of ways and money doesn't solve all problems and I think they've kind of learned that lesson I think it sounded like Bor learned that lesson yesterday it's not always about throwing the most money at something it's about getting the right guy building the right culture getting the right players for the program and hopefully they do that with a Dan Campbell or Jeff trailer or somebody that fits them perfectly they thought Jimbo fit him because he wore Wranglers and had a ranch and had an accent but Jimbo alienated the Texas High School coaches association Jimbo wasn't beloved by A&M fans as Richard Oliver was telling us last night not a bad guy not a bad coach at all was it your uh was it your tweet that said Texas A&M has one national championship in football and it was in 1939 yeah the billionaire Aggie booster see themselves as Georgia Oklahoma Alabama USC or Michigan when in reality they're like Michigan or Mississippi State South Carolina yeah they've won one title it's 1939 n but but the Aggie booster who hires Jimbo sees himself in the mirror as Alabama and Georgia and outside of the State of Texas like Dan Lanning is one of on their list why in the world would you leave Oregon that's yeah why but but see A&M booster thinks well you can't wait to get here he's in Oregon he can't wait to get here because we're Texas A&M and I think it's it's a skewed view of themselves Chuck well I mean playing in that League obviously has elevated their prominence nationally and the brand and everything else playing in that League means something so and if you win in that league and win a lot you're going to be remembered for all times and if you win there you know it's going to mean a lot there too I don't know it it's a hard one to read right I'm I think Jimbo was smart the way he protected himself he knew accepting that kind of money was going to put a bigger Target on his head in terms of if you want to get rid of me if we don't meet the expectations then somebody is going to have your head so to speak and so to his credit he got the right representation to make sure that he got everything that he could possibly get if they were going to do something like this yeah what was it his his upfront payout is like 21 or $19 million and then they pay him 7.1 million every year until 2031 now like someone get him to sign my contract next time like good Lord what a deal those are private dollars so it's not like the school you know anybody's going to have to worry about tuition going up which is a good thing by the way so you parent yes and and a daughter that's a trainer on the football team so you know she's kind of in it every single day and I think it's just it's the business of football right Jimbo's not a bad guy it's like Don said he's not a bad coach it's just it just didn't work to the level that the expectation is at A&M and I get it too they they've put in the resources they've put in the time they've given this coaching staff every opportunity from a resource standpoint to go win a lot of football games it's not like he's losing a lot of football games but he's not winning the 5050 games right you've got to win the Old Miss games for sure you've got to win you can't lose two years in a row to them and you can't lose close games all these close games I mean they how many times have they lost this year where you know they were right there but just couldn't finish and you know again it's not a perfect world right he's not working with his best quarterback had a their best game the other day with their third string quarterback I mean it's but it's also like when you have all the resources in the world like Texas A&M does and you have basically everything in front of you it comes down to how you execute on the field but also how you treat people on and off the field he consistently didn't evolve or didn't change his offense when he clearly needed to he didn't really uh delve into nil until it was until they really needed to and then he started throwing money at everybody it was like you you need to figure out a way if you're the face of this team and the face of this organization that you have to do all those things well Bor said a lot yesterday about you have to evolve I think he was talking about Jimbo um but yeah it's about it's I think there's a there's an issue with thinking that the resources in and of itself is the answer for example um they started crushing it in nil they were the first to to do the collective and all that stuff so they just threw money at five stars on Rivals like Denver Harris and those guys that they ran off after a year yeah and they had great recruiting classes because of they had great recruiting in classes but not great kids and not uh they were seven kids they had to run off after freshman because they were smoking weed in the locker room after losses things like that where where you can build a program with a culture that's what they're looking for without money you know other guys have done it in in in lesser places that didn't have those resources so yes they're right that they have all the resources to give him and that he didn't do enough but they got to hire a guy who knows how to use the resources best and again I go back to who is Texas A&M who who do they think they are so like my son Grant who is the most knowledgeable college football person that I know texted me this he said the job tiers in the SEC tier one Alabama and Georgia tier two Texas LSU and Oklahoma tier three Tennessee A&M and Auburn and then Florida and Old Miss is tier and Arkansas's tier four right now that for that job to take that job like if you're a coach and the job tiers like you know the best jobs in college football I mean yeah I don't I don't know they're not well I know Alabama Georgia Texas LSU or Oklahoma but I don't know that Texas A&M isn't on the same wavelength when it comes to how good of a job that is as Texas because they have the same amount of resources they the same amount of of kind of prestige when it comes they make more money than anybody I mean that's fact I think I think that a Texas A&M if Sark went to Texas A&M he'd be having the same success as he is right now in with the Longhorns it comes to it comes down it comes down to the indivual it comes down to the individual the culture that they create like that's why we're all in on Jeff trailer going to coach Texas A&M because it's like he could he could become he could become it at Texas A&M he could be there for 20 years because of the relationships he has with Texas coaches Texas High School coaches because of the culture that he builds and the triangle and the belief that he has in his players and the winning culture that he brings like I feel like Jeff is exactly what Texas A&M needs not someone like Jimbo or some big name that's going to come in there with and think that their Dick's already been there for two minutes I think it comes down to you have to have somebody that has a innate sense of attention to detail right you can't just say this is what we want to be and then you know throw things at the wall you have to have everything written out and then you have to teach the kids how you want them to play how you want them to act all those things and some guys are going to get it and some guys aren't but I think if you have most of the people all going in the same direction based off the blueprint I mean it's kind of like what I think you can see with what's going on with the Cowboys I mean I think McCarthy's attention to detail you may not like whatever the details that he is but at least everybody knows what the plan is and they're going and trying to execute the plan and doesn't seem like anybody like you don't I don't know it just seems like there's like you can tell right it's the same thing with trailer I think that's a great example of a guy that he's not only walking the walk he's talking the talk he's showing everybody what you need to do in order to get down let ask this let me ask you this is there something innate about the Aggie culture that makes the jimbos of the world spend more time managing up than managing down in other words Jimbo needs to be in the locker room knowing that Connor Wegman is in a Sociology class and in Spanish and how are you doing in Spanish but he doesn't have time to know that kid like that because he's got to deal with the big oil guys who are bothering him yeah I don't I don't know if there's that I mean I can't speak to that obviously but I mean I think Jimbo like I've seen a lot of humanity from that guy and on days where I quite frankly would have not been surprised he not done what he was doing for the kids or his players for instance it's a big thing to get a ring at that school and my daughter was getting a ring and not a championship ring it's a school ring they haven't gotten any of those so they Jimbo had all the kids from the football team that were getting their Rings all the equipment people all the trainers I mean these are just college kids you know and he took the time on the day they found out that Wegman was done for the year he still did that took pictures with the kids made human connections with the kids I mean I don't know a lot of guys that would do that so I think if there's anybody out there saying that he didn't ingratiate himself or you know work the room or all that maybe he didn't work the right rooms I don't know but I mean I saw enough and you know just even when Kell Mond was going through the draft process I mean he he was at kellen's house and you know I mean there are things that you see that you know maybe other people don't and it's easy to sit back and throw stuff at the wall and you know some of it I'm sure you know might be true but there's the other side too it's he's not The Devil he's not a horrible football coach he want a national championship for Christ's sake I mean you know what do you how can you say a he won one he did but does anybody owe more to one player than he does to to jamus Winston you still have to build a program and he he ingratiated himself to the right people as you said work the room enough to get a ridiculous extension in 2021 so they loved him you don't give a guy what they're giving him now right they they loved him two years ago because he was winning his first three years his last three years have just sucked no he he was he finished as the number four team in the country in 2020 won he won one year he they finished as the number four team in the country in 2020 one year yeah and they should have gotten in every other year they had at least three Lo four losses yes they had one good year One Good Year and then last year they were decimated by injuries look we can make excuses for the guy and I feel like I am but just to kind of even the playing field Jimbo knew what he was signing up for and the good news is is that he's going to come out the winner on the other end another and he's going to get paid very very well so the ad said that they were stuck in neutral um now they have the task of replacing him and there's a lot of names on the list and and you've we' you've mentioned Danny Lanning over at Oregon I personally have no idea why you would leave a job like Oregon to go to Texas A&M he won't uh kayin dor over at Washington maybe you leave Washington to go to Texas A&M um there's a few other names on the list though it's Duke Coach Mike Elco I think he's the favorite I think he's the favorite as well uh cuz Duke football is just it's not you know it's not Texas A&M football yeah but he was with Jimbo at yeah then you got Lane you're just leaving one basketball school for another that's right lane kein is also on the list uh from Old Miss I'm kidding agie fans no he's not don't add me I saw a great tweet though it said just sign and just do the deal with the devil you want to win at all costs go get Urban Meyer yeah that's good would Urban ever want to do that like he would he would be the first guy he'd be there for four years they might win a National Championship and then he'd like his heart would go out like he he that dude needs to work on his health before he comes back anywhere he he would sign for the contract that Jimbo did but they're not going to give anybody that kind of money again there's never going to be a buyout like that did you see did you see at the the halftime of the game the loss that they just had on Saturday halftime the donors gave a check to the athletic department for1 $ 60 million then the next day they fire jumo what a look that is I thought Mac angle of the forward Star Telegram had a bunch of good takes on this where he said the contract became the face of A&M football I think that was pretty much right yeah when when you're looking at the contract and you're like we can't fire him just because we're paying him it's like he's already done done he's it's a lame duck coach at that point you can't have a lame duck coach in college sports or any sport really uh so who do you guys think replaces him who's the favorite for you uh I think elco's the favorite um just with his ties to A&M I I would love to see Dan Campbell go there he would kill it there but he's got a good thing going in Detroit I think uh group of five guys like Jeff trayer are might be I might say that trailer is the best candidate but I don't think they'll hire him because I don't think they see Jeff trailer beating Nick Sabin or Kirby Smart in a living room uh to get get the festar best player in the country although Jeff W like where was Nick Sabin before he was Nick Sabin right eventually you have to get that chance and Jeff's drilled it wherever he's gotten the chance he was the big 12 recruiter of the year two years in a row at Texas and as much as we want Jeff to stay here at UTSA because I think we would like him to be here forever it's not it's not likely I mean it's just it's not how college football works you started a small school and you go to a big one and you make a name for yourself Jeff is one of the best coaches in the country but he's turned down Texas Tech he's turned down Purdue Arkansas's knocking at the door right now and he's not interested he would leave for A&M he'd leave for Texas he's got a Texas um he is Texas he is Texas and I think he's he'll admit he would be successful in Texas but not necessarily at Purdue right and I think that's why he turned him down but I don't think he leaves for any power five job because he hasn't um but I do think he would leave for that one I'm good with that who you think replaces him replaces Jimbo who who would who would you hire to replace Jimbo probably trailer I mean why not you got nothing to lose I mean if you said you're stuck in neutral and you're driving 55 in the left lane by the way I thought that was a nice way to kind of paint the picture because I start to get triggered when I was hearing that I was like damn I know what he's talking about anybody else laying on the horn on those I don't know I mean it's a tough one right but I think you need to go outside the box but they've already Ted Al about they're going to have some outside help and you know now all of a sudden you're talking about this person knows this person this person's connected to this person now all of a sudden it becomes that room gets a little smaller because of they're not truly looking at the national landscape they're looking at the people that they're connected to with these companies so personally I think Jeff is the best fit um maybe it's because I'm biased towards Jeff because he's San Antonio I think we all are I think Weir we seen it firstand we're fair to admit like he's done so much more with less here he has built a culture that we expect to win now as a I went to my first UTSA game as a fan on Saturday and just like seeing him on the field with his guys and like just seeing how they interact they all freaking love him and everybody around UTSA loves Jeff half of his job right now is getting money for the program that would go away at Texas A&M and he could focus on football and doing what he does and focus on what he loves to do which is coach football here in Texas but I think yeah that would be an added benefit at you know the next stop too is that he's done all of those things and not just you know had to just worry about football the thing that A&M should want to hire Jeff for is and I don't I if I hope that they don't hire him for this reason solely is you would have to pay him far less than you would Danny Lanning or kayin dor or Urban Meyer or any of these other names that we've thrown out there and with when you're paying $75 million to a coach that no longer coaches for you you might want to you know take a little bit of a discount on the next coach I think they would yeah I think he's making three I think they could get him for five and a half six million for sure but anyway it was an entertaining weekend uh to say the least sorry to Jimbo for losing that job but I think we all agree it was time to make a change there so let's get to the Cowboys and the Texans uh Cowboys Texans both win Texans pull one off in surprising fashion in Cincinnati beating the Bengals the Cowboys another dominant effort against the Giants um the Giants suck and the Cowboys don't I don't think we really learned a whole lot in that game did we that they handled their business and I think it goes back to you know talking about UTSA I mean if you go into a game and that one's probably not a good example but there are certain games you have to win right yeah like utsa's got to beat rice right but that to me looked like a trap game rice had been playing pretty well they played the other two undefeated teams in the conference tooth and nail one score games and UTSA just beat the snot out of rice so they're handling their business and I I think there's something to be said about guys that can get guys to go do that week in and week out and I think if you're the Cowboys you not only had to win that game you had to win convincingly the point spread was almost 17 points and they went out and literally dismantled them after the first couple DS I I think it was good in that um now the Giants aren't great competition but it doesn't matter who the competition was compared to what we saw the Cowboys offense run like I think McCarthy's been listening to his players and the critics in the sense that CD lamb three weeks ago was like give me the ball I can help you and they did historically Brandon Cooks was like why did we get the media was asking why did you sign him if you're never going to throw in the ball they did Tony Pard is not Tough Enough we need a banger in there Rico dowo got plenty of carries and showed he was very physical in the Red Zone after Pard failed on a early fourth fourth down uh goal line stand y so to me it was like I was really encouraged by what I saw because like okay if this is what they're going to do if they're gonna feature CD I think he had nine and and the other guy had 11 or he had nine 11 and and Cooks had nine and then they still had Ferguson for they had over the two of those guys combined had over 300 yards receiving and Dak had four over 400 so it was it was the The Duo receivers and I think there was a commitment to keep more people in and to play a little more smash mouthy and simplify the offense a little bit more and just you know stop spreading it you know don't go with five wides and all the you know the window dressing and everything else bottom line there's only one ball so let's yeah concentrate on the two guys we know that are really really good and even 13 got loose on some who's this 83 where did he get on the team say what I'm sorry this8 I had to go looking for my phone who's number 83 Jay Brooks Jaylen Brooks yeah when did he show up yesterday I don't know where' Jaylen Tolbert come where is Jaylen Tolbert Speak oh he was good a couple of weeks ago practice I don't know the history to be honest with you what's his first name Jaylen no Jaylen Tolbert Jaylen Brooks oh there's two Jay two Jay okay there you go see I learn something I oh I think he was like the eighth round seventh round draft pick so I think what we take away from the game uh is you were right Rico needs to be featured more and I think that they noticed that and they figured that out um he got 12 carries for 79 Tony pards 15 for 55 I think uh the book might still be out on Duce vau but I don't think Duce vaugh is anything more than a gadget guy um he wasn't great in the punt return game you can see there's a not noticeable difference between him and kavante Turpin uh in the punt return game uh he's not he can't really do like the Darren sprouls thing and actually getting free in in in space it looked like so I was I was a little discouraged with Duce Von's showing um Tony Pard I think has cost himself probably the most amount of money that any player has in the entire league this year by his play um I think he was probably a 11 12 million a year guy for three years and now he's probably like a my sanders type contract kind of guy like a 4-year 20 he's probably cost himself millions and millions of dollars with how badly he's played this year yeah it's coming off that injury too you know I mean that was a significant injury and you got to remember in that 49er game when he got hurt you could tell the 49ers had one game plan in that game which was to stop him and the game plan for the Cowboys was going to be get him the ball and you know quite frankly he has not been the same since we haven't seen a game that even looked remotely close to being the guy Jerry looks like a genius for the uh one year yeah well I mean he I don't think he was GNA he wasn't going to step in it again with like he did with Zeke he wasn't going to pay another back like Zeke uh like Zeke's contct but I mean to tag him you know oh yeah no but that's what I'm saying like Tony wanted a longer term deal three four years uh and obviously they weren't going to do it because and I think they still have some residual cuts and bruises from what they gave and had he been run if he's running for 150 yards a game it would have cost Jer money but he took that gamble yep absolutely um I think the the Texans being good question mark have has kind of proposed some interesting uh topics if you were starting a team right now and you had Dak or CJ strad to choose from knowing what we know about each player who would you start with if we're starting the team right now if starting team right this second for me it would have to be CJ just because of his Youth and what I've seen so far yeah I I would go a step further I would I would take him uh I would take him in a straightup trade one for one today yeah I well what if I wouldn't do that but if I was starting a team which to me lets my mind wander if I'm starting a team and we know we're going to have to go if it's is an expansion team this is who I would want to build my team around but I think the Cowboys have done that around Dak too so all things being equal not not not talking about the contract looking at it let's say both you have both of them for five years and you're starting a team you want CJ strad over Dak Prescott if you could guarantee me that Dak was going to be healthy yeah five years yeah take Health out of it then I would take Dak okay CJ I would take CJ I think he's got I think this goes back to uh what it is when they're drafted right like Dak it's like wimy right it's like duh right right Dak was a fourth D Dak was a fourth round draft pick CJ stra was the number two pick overall when you look at velocity um the way he delivers the ball how quickly it comes out of his hand I think you can teach him the other things I did have questions about him coming out of Ohio State after he flunked the wonderlake twice but he's shown to have a clutch genan he's shown to be a leader I I love a lot of things about Dak I think Dak is smart I think Dak is a very good leader that's probably his best quality I think guys love playing with him I do think his physical limitations are enough compared to CJ's physical gifts that I would take CJ and I think that with the Texans outside of this scenario I think with the Texans specifically you put him with Deo who is that kind of calming personality and just kind of that players coach it almost empowers CJ a little bit more in that offense it's like he's a defensive guy deo's going to go control the defense the Texans and their offensive coordinator and CJ strad they can shape the the offense the way that they want and they're kind of doing everything the way that CJ needs them to do they're bringing him along slowly they're listening to what he does best they're going going through the reads and and then CJ himself is actually doing himself so many favors by making quick decisions and if it's not there he's chucking it away like he's making All the Right Moves as a quarterback and what you see right now is why he's he's in the MVP conver conversation now yeah I mean the fact that he doesn't turn the ball over as a young player is just I mean he had a h a bad one yesterday I mean they're all bad but really bad that could have flipped the game but to his credit it did flip the game not his team's favor but at the end he was great he got two huge plays from the ex-cowboys down the stretch of that game Dalton Schultz and uh Noah uh Wilson right Noah Brown Noah Brown sorry yes but the throw to Noah Brown was what impressed me well tank because it wasn't really there on that last play to set the field goal it wasn't really there and he really trusted his arm strength and just fired it in there on a contested slant and Noah broke that tackle but um you can tell as you're were talking about the decision making I'm trusting the fact that this has to come out of my hand right now even though it's not necessarily there it was a great play by CJ and we're when we're watching the games on TV it's almost like I'm like Dak has scarred me because when I'm watching CJ play and when the ball goes out of frame and they're going they're going to panning over to the receiver I think that ball is going to be caught by one of the Texans receivers I just think that it's going to be a wide open receiver and CJ strad has just completed another ball like that's what I think as the camera's painting over you can't really see who he's throwing to when I see Dak throw the ball I'm like like who's that going to you know like I just I there maybe there's so much optimism with CJ but I just don't know what Dak uh I don't Dak has like scarred me now so whereever whenever he throws the ball down the field I'm like hope this goes to the right guy he's still kind of learning you know how McCarthy wants to do things and you know I think there should be a little bit of a grace period on that and then the last two weeks though he's been freaking Dynamite Man yes no but he's played really well he Dak played really well against Philly he played really well against the Giants they still have their Red Zone issues which is going to continue to bite them in the butt but um not if they run tornado reverses to CD lamb CD lamb is proving everybody why he's going to be worth $120 million this offseason so he didn't have to prove anything to me coming out of Oklahoma I thought he was the best player in the country should have been the Heisman Trophy winner it's going to be to see who gets paid more him or uh Justin Jefferson because J Jed is is another another kind of beast but yeah all right guys that was a fun one that's it that's all there is there's no more I told you I'm going to try and make these things go a little quicker wow that's good yeah that's we're going slid under the 30 minutes yeah 32 minutes we're at right now I'm like I said we're trying to go a little quicker that they were dragging on before so I'm going to uh it's on me I'm the producer and the host here so I got to make I got to you know make things go quicker well you know we would talk all day

time I'm not really worried about all-wheel drive I'm not really worried about having all I just want an SUV again I liked having an [Music] SUV this is we to return to the station get lied what I liked about an SUV is I had more I had more area that I didn't have to put see in the in a pickup yeah I got the extended cab poor door but mounting stuff inside of it takes up a lot of room in the SUV I could put everything in the back in the cargo area and it's still inside the cab see what I'm getting [Music] at yes my transmission will work on [Music] that if it's the Denali it's a it's if it's the Denali Edition it's got the 6.0 and O2 still has the 6.0 my transmission will work in it the 6.0 transmission will bolt right up to this motor only thing I'd have to do to this motor is just add one wire to the harness and reset the the [Music] ECU so this was uh TC two vehicles involved there's the pickup that was involved with the car I just was [Music] showing cuz like I said Randy all you'd have to do is Flash the computer and and add one wire into the harness they have transported one of the occupants of the of one vehicle how many cars do I have I have three pickups how are you

motor into any vehicle correct so all you got to do is when you want to upgrade a motor as long as the motor is newer than the vehicle that you're going to put the motor and transmission in it's legal in the state of California you just got to do the wiring harness for it [Music] correct you just got to make sure it's SM compliant I don't know exactly what happened but that truck is bow so some [Music] ready let get to [Music] damn AC from the cemeter I'm just saying I got a 6.0 and the trans the 4L ad transmission that I can put in that vehicle and it'll work just do a little bit of upgrading to the wiring harness and it'll all work it'll still be smog legal anything is doable in the state of California as long as the motor is newer and not all souped up you can do the swamp on

Jean-Pierre is joined by NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby at a ...", "video_transcript": "good afternoon everyone so I have one thing at the stop at the top before I turn it over uh to guest so I want to start out by noting that this week we celebrate two years since President Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure law in that short time this Administration has made historic progress in rebuilding America from breaking ground on major projects to rebuild our roads and bridges to delivering clean and clean and safer Safe Water to communities Across the Nation to cleaning up Legacy pollution expanding access to high-speed internet and building a clean energy economy here in the United States that supports good paying jobs so far the bipartisan infrastructure law has enabled us to launch 40,000 infrastructure projects and award in 4,500 communities across the country this historic investment in America has allowed up to more than 21 million lowincome households with access to free or discounted highspeed internet service through the affordable connectivity program that's what has been able to provide those to 21 million low-income households start improvements on hundreds of thousands of miles of roads and thousands of bridge repairs helped purchase more than 3,000 clean transit buses doubling their number on America's roadways as well as 2,400 clean school buses launch 2,300 projects to help communities build resilience to threats such as the impacts of climate change and cyber attacks and that is not all the bipartisan infrastructure law and the entirety of the president's investing in America agenda has spurred more than $614 billion in additional private sector manufacturing and clean energy Investments since President Biden took office not taxpayer dollars private sector Investments That is bolstering the president's work to create millions of good paying jobs including a record high number of jobs in the construction SE sector that's EX L what bionomics is all about investing in America and in American workers to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up and with that uh we have Jake Sullivan here our national security adviser to talk through the president's trip to uh San Francisco uh this week and also the blet that you all are going to see uh later today with President Widodo and take any other uh foreign policy questions that you all may have thank you Karine and thanks everybody it's uh obviously an extremely busy busy time so I apologize my opening comments are going to be a little bit longer than usual but if you bear with me I'll be able to answer whatever questions you have today President Biden kicks off a significant week of highlevel diplomacy that will showcase the breadth of America's strategic and economic engagement in the world and the value we place on deepening our alliances and Partnerships this afternoon in fact very shortly President Biden will host president Joko woto of Indonesia on the C of celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations between the United States and Indonesia our two countries will announce the elevation of our bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership a new chapter that will drive Innovation and prosperity and cooperation for both of our countries President Biden and president woto will have the opportunity to discuss a range of key issues including the clean energy transition critical minerals and deepening our security and defense cooperation on Wednesday as you have heard President Biden and president XI will meet in the Bay area for a summit we anticipate that the leaders will discuss some of the most fundamental elements of the US PRC bilateral relationship including the continued importance of strengthening open lines of communication and managing competition responsibly so that it does not Veer into conflict the way we achieve that is through intense diplomacy that's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises that's how we work together where and when our interests overlap and deliver on key priorities for the American people and that's why in recent months I've had the opportunity to meet with director Wong y three times and it's why our secretaries of State Treasury and commerce all went to Beijing it's also why China for its part sent its vice president its foreign minister and other senior officials here to the United States in recent months President Biden comes into this Summit on a solid footing given the ways in which he has position the United States to be able to compete effectively both at home and around the world at home we've had the strongest recovery and lowest inflation of any leading economy we've created 14 million jobs more jobs in two years than any president in a 4-year term and we've had 21 straight months of unemployment under 4% for the first time in half a century AB broad President Biden has deepened our alliances and Partnerships in just the last year he's hosted the leader from Japan the r the Philippines India and Australia for bilateral meetings here in Washington he formerly launched Aus he held a historic trilateral Summit with the r and Japan at Camp David he upgraded our relations with Vietnam and a historic trip to Hanoi and he's hosted two Summits at the White House for Pacific island leaders as well as a special us aan Summit finally at President Biden's Direction we've taken important steps to protect our nation National Security we've put in place new rules on outbound investment and updated our export controls on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment and we've continued to uphold freedom of navigation in the region by flying sailing and operating wherever international law allows we're also looking for specific outcomes from the meeting on November 15th I won't get too far ahead of the meeting and I'll let the president speak for himself after he has the chance to meet with president shei but we believe that there our areas where our interests overlap like our efforts to combat the illicit fentanyl trade there are also areas where we can more effectively manage competition for example by reestablishing military to military Communications and there are of course critical Global issues that the two leaders will need to discuss including uh Russia's war against Ukraine and the evolving crisis in the Middle East all in all we're looking forward to a productive meeting President Biden has a launch history with President XI their conversations are direct they're straightforward and President Biden believes that there is no substitute for leader to leader face-to-face diplomacy to manage this complex relationship between the United States and China of course this week President Biden will this coming week will be doing a lot more than just meeting with President XI he'll be welcoming leaders from across the Asia Pacific for Apec economic leaders week at a moment when the most dynamic economic in the world is looking to the United States as the leading economy in the world while in San Francisco you'll see President Biden put forward his economic vision for the region he will speak about how the United States is the preeminent driver of inclusive sustainable economic growth in the Asia Pacific and how the Asia Pacific is critical to growth here at home you'll see the president join leaders from across the region to announce in record time clear outcomes on a number of pillars of the IND Pacific economic framework you'll see him hosting a partnership for Global infrastructure and investment PGI event with major CEOs and ipf governments that will demonstrate how we are identifying new ways of working with the US private sector to drive high standard investment in the indopacific in infrastructure in Innovation and other areas to unlock sustainable long-term growth and we're also hosting an event with major foreign CEOs focused on how President Biden's economic policies combined with our strong partnership with asia-pacific economies are driving historic and outsize Investments here in the United States in critical and emerging Technologies and in other areas and creating good paying jobs for American workers finally before I take questions I want to give a brief update on the Middle East the United States continues to work Round the Clock to support efforts to rescue and reunite hostages held by Hamas with their families where they belong this includes many young children one of whom is a three-year-old American citizen toddler whose parents were tragically killed by Hamas on October 7th this is a top priority for President Biden for vice president Harris for secretary blinkin for me personally we have all spoken with families of US citizens who are being held hostage by Hamas and have raised this issue with all of our counterparts this remains a Paramount priority for us just yesterday President Biden spoke with the Amir of cutter to discuss the important efforts and the important negotiations ongoing to try to secure the release of the hostages being held by Hamas and later today here at the White House I'll be meeting with some of the families of the Americans who are currently being held the United States has also been leading efforts to increase the flow of life-saving sustained humanitarian assistance food water medicine into Gaza while we've made some progress much more is urgently needed to alleviate suffering among Ong the civilian population in Gaza we're glad to see Israel take an important step in this direction last week and we remain in active discussions with the Israeli government about the importance of tactical humanitarian pauses in the fighting to permit civilians to depart areas of active hostilities to increase the flow of Aid and to enable hostage releases we continue to have discussions at all levels including President Biden with prime minister Netanyahu to urge Israel to continue taking every possible measure to protect civilians the loss of a single innocent life is a tragedy whether it's a Palestinian civilian an Israeli civilian or anyone else and we grieve for every innocent who has lost at the same time we will continue to stand behind the proposition that Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and with Hamas as I've said you're dealing with an organization that has come out publicly since October 7th and said that it intends to commit an another October 7th and another one until Israel no longer exists you have a leading spokesman from Hamas saying that the objective of the organization is a permanent state of war with Israel that is the reality that Israel is confronting and it's a reality that would be unacceptable for any nation and with that I will be happy to take your questions yeah thanks Jake uh you said yesterday and the president said just now in the Oval Office that hospitals in Gaza need to be protected do you believe that the Israelis have received that message and have they had any response so first uh what the president has just said and what I've said is that we do not want to see firefights in hospitals we want to see patients protected we want to see hospitals protected we have spoken with the Israeli government about this and they have said they share that view that they do not want to see firefights in hospitals and you've heard from IDF spokespeople uh stating things along those lines the Israeli government has also told us that they are prepared to provide fuel to hospitals to ensure that they can continue to operate and that they for certain hospitals they actually have not been able to be in communication with the people who are actually running the hospitals so that's something we will continue to work on but the position of the United States on this matter is clear hospitals should be protected hospitals should be able to run effectively so that Medical Care should be can be given to patients and finally to the extent people need to be evacuated from One hospital to another hospital in order to ensure the continuation of care uation routes have to be safe and the Israeli government has told us as recently as today that there are and will continue to be evacuation routes for uh people leaving hospital compounds so these are positions that for us are straightforward they are clear we have a constructive discussion with the Israeli government on this and I believe that they have indicated they hold similar positions on these issues now as for what happens on the ground you know in a given hour on a given day we can't react to every individual report we can simply continue to State our position and continue to consult with the Israeli government uh to ensure that they are doing their best to fulfill their stated position on this and then more broadly the US is now focused on two Wars one in the Middle East one in Ukraine what would it mean for this government and in particular uh foreign policy and the military if there were to be a government shut down come Friday night this would be a devastating blow first of all to our service members at a very human level because it would have an impact on uh the ability of our troops to and their families to get all of the benefits and services that they deserve for the service they are performing for our country second it would send a signal to the world that the United States cannot pull together on a bipartisan basis to sustain Government funding and to show a United face to the world uh at a moment where you see this turbulence around the world so we will do everything in our power uh to support Congress coming together around a measure that will fund the government and not have a shutdown occur at the end of this week the President also said there's an effort to use the pause to deal with the release of prisoners and it's being negotiated with Qatar could you amplify on that a little bit yes uh there have been ongoing discussions with the government of qar and in fact President Biden as I mentioned in my opening statement spoke by telephone with the Amir of cutter yesterday cutter has been talking to Hamas Israel has been talking to Cutter the United States has been talking to both Israel and cter in an effort uh to try to move forward these negotiations to a point where hostages can be released and reunited with their families we're not there yet but we are continuing to try to make progress on that day by day hour by hour and as I said before the president has no higher priority which is why he is personally engaged on this issue secondly on the trip itself what does the president plan to tell president X in terms of getting Iran to rein in its proxy attacks on US forces in the Middle East well from our perspective the PRC should share the interest of every responsible country that deescalation rather than escalation in the broader Middle East should be the order of the day so President Biden will make the point to president XI that Iran acting in an escalatory destabilizing way that undermines uh stability across the broader Middle East is not in the interests of of the PRC or of any other responsible country and PRC of course has a relationship with Iran and it's capable if it chooses to of making those points directly to the Iranian government yeah um yesterday youed to U Israeli intelligence this does the US have any independent intelligence that Hamas has military facilities of Bunker under P ala Hospital in Gaza well what I said yesterday is that I'm not in a position to comment on intelligence matters American intelligence matters I can't divulge that to you what I can tell you is that we see plenty of Open Source reporting about hamas's use of hospitals and other civilian infrastructure to store weapons to house Fighters uh to engage in in forms of command and control but beyond that I'm not in a position to to speak specifically to a report about a specific hospital or specific bunker and so when President says that hospitals must be protected um what does the president what does the United States want to see done with ala Hospital in particular and the hos facilities that you now point to open source intelligence saying lie under it well your question points up the complexity of this conflict and the added burden that Israel is facing as it goes against murderous terrorists who continue to say their goal is the absolute destruction of the state of Israel you're dealing with a terrorist organization Hamas that takes civilian uh hostages including little children that uses civilians as human Shields that uses civilian infrastructure even hospitals in the most cynical way possible that is as fighting positions as uh military operation centers and so Israel has to confront that while at the same time not wanting to go assaulting hospitals in firefights that could put innocent people who are getting life-saving Medical Care in the crossfire so there are not easy answers to this question but this is the complexity this is the burden that the Israeli Defense Forces are facing as they uh conduct their operations and our position is that Israel has the right to go after Hamas but it does face this added burden and that burden does not lessen its responsibility to act according to the laws of war and so how that plays out in a particular operational Dynamic this tunnel or that bunker ultimately those decisions lie with the the military fighting the United States can't dictate that but we will continue to stand for the principle that the laws of war must be respected even as Israel goes after Hamas and the tools and infrastructure of its terrorism yeah do you have any proof of Life on hostages especially the Americans in the negotiations that have been going on has there been anything that could reassure the negotiators the president and you that hostages remain alive and potentially could be rescued so we have been very transparent about the fact that we have limited visibility into both the whereabouts of the hostages within Gaza and their condition and and I said as recently as yesterday that we have nine missing Americans one missing green card holder and I cannot look in the eye and tell you how many of those hostages are still alive we do have information and I'll be careful about how I characterize that um about some of the hostages and and and a notion that there are a substantial number of hostages who are not just alive but who could potentially be part of a hostage release but I couldn't give you a number of exactly how many Americans would be included in that that's something that we will have to work through as we continue these negotiations and of course we won't know for certain until we we actually get the release of those hostages and their safely returned to their families so that's something we're going to continue to work on uh thanks uh I want to ask about the house spending proposal does not include money for National Security priorities uh that the Administration has uh Israel Ukraine particularly Ukraine uh what are the next steps for getting funding if if this spending proposal is not an option so I will leave it to Karen to kind of talk about the Congressional Dynamics and particular measures that have been put forward in the house what I will say is that the the president the Biden Administration put forward a funding request for Israel for Ukraine for the indopacific and for the Border uh we detailed exactly what we needed including for Ukraine and we still need that and we need it as soon as we can get it and we are working actively with both the house and the Senate both Republicans and Democrats to secure the votes and to get the vote to get that funding and I continue to remain confident that while this has been a Winding Road since we began the effort to secure additional funding for Ukraine that there is a strong bipartisan majority in both houses to do it and we will ultimately get it done how exactly through what vehicle and what measure that's something that I will defer to the legislative experts on I will only say that we are continuing to make the case actively I'm on the phone personally daily with members both Democrats and Republicans to make the case and we are leaning forward in making it clear that the United States national interest will be deeply harmed if we are not able to secure and sustain funding for Israel Ukraine the indopacific and the border and if I may ask about the trip please um what what is the president's message going to be regarding taiwan's upcoming elections will the will the president warn president shei directly for example against interfering in the elections I I'm not going to preview what exactly President Biden will say to president XI because I think he should have the opportunity to speak to him directly in person without me proclaiming it from the podium I will say that the president broadly speaking is going to set out um a vision for peace and stability and the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan straight and he will do that in his meeting with President she but in terms of the specifics of that conversation I will leave that to the president to do person to person face to face yeah thank you Jake how confident is the US that the US and China can restore military to military Communications it's now been more than a year since China suspended those talks so what are the main sticking points from the Chinese side I'll defer to well not defer to refer to China on the sticking points because ultimately they'll have to answer that for themselves the United States has been ready for that entire period to sustain military to military Communications because we think it's the only responsible thing to do having our two militaries in communication is the way you reduce mistake you avoid escalation you manage competition so it doesn't beer into conflict that to us is an absolutely straightforward factor and no matter what else is happening in the relationship those military to military links should remain intact that's our position going into San Francisco we believe that uh the PRC has been constructive in the dialogue we've been having with them on this issue uh we will see what happens in San Francisco and the president will be able to report after the meeting whether in fact we've made progress on restoring military to military links assessment for why the Chinese has been willing to engage so much more in recent months how much of it has to do with China's economic struggles and if that's the case how can you be sure what comes out of Apec is long lasting and not just tactical from the Chinese side well look I'm not going to speculate as to what China's motives are again that's a question you should pose to them and and they can lay it out for you I do think your question raises an important point though which is nothing stands still in the world as we've just seen from the the October 7th crisis and there will be you know inevitably things that arise that are unanticipated there will be turbulence as there always is and the question is can we create the lines of communication and the broad parameters in the relationship so that through whatever comes we can manage competition responsibly so it doesn't Veer into conflict that's what the president has set out to achieve in this Summit with President XI and so he sees this not just as a one-off meeting but as an important moment to be able to establish the kind of basis upon which we can proceed out into the future Jake you mentioned that you guys see this as an important meeting on Wednesday but I'm curious will the president during his time with the Chinese president tried to hold China accountable for the Spy balloon this year I know obviously it seems like it was 20 years ago but it was this year the Chinese have said it was still a weather balloon they said they should get the technology back what kind of response are we going to see from the president this week on the SPID well as I said before I'm going to let the president be able to sit down with President XI and speak to him personto person face to face and again not be doing diplomacy from the podium and we can report to you afterwards consistent with whatever um you know is appropriate to share publicly on these issues but I will say that uh President Biden took steps to uh take down that balloon once it was safe to do so and out of potential Harm's Way to civilians we were able to recover it to exploit it and from our perspective the critical thing is that uh because we were able to protect ourselves along the way of that path we do not feel that there was any information gain that was problematic and so the United States the president is going to focus at this point on how he stands up for and protects American interest going forward across the full range of challenges in this relationship of which this is one you want Tanya to apologize again I'm going to let President Biden speak to president XI I'm not going to stand here from the podium and and kind of create threats or raise questions or make particular demands because I think that will not be the most effective way to secure the Diplomatic outcomes the American people are looking for Jak how would you rate relations between the US and China since President Biden's meeting with President XI last year and what would you say that the US has been able to achieve in the relationship as a direct result of their last meeting well first the most important thing is that this is a complex relationship a competitive relationship that could easily Veer into conflict or confrontation if it's not well managed and so managing the relationship in an effective way is the single most important responsibility of the president and everyone who works for him on this file and then beyond that the US and China have to be able to speak directly to one another on all of the critical issues that face our two countries including issues uh in moments of Crisis like the Russia Ukraine crisis and President Biden has had a number of candid conversations with President XI about the question of Military Support to the Russian Federation in the conduct of its war in Ukraine President Biden has had the opportunity to engage and so have the rest of us on how we effectively manage peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait so that we can sustain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait so those are some of the issues that through intense diplomacy we have been able to manage intense competition and then we will look for opportunities to actually generate affirmative outcomes that deliver tangible progress for the American people in areas where our interest overlap I mentioned for example the issue of fentanyl we're hoping to see some progress on that issue this coming week and that could then open the door to further cooperation on other issues where we aren't just managing things but we're actually delivering uh tangible results we'll continue to work at that as we go forward yeah the us yesterday launched its third round of strikes against facilities tied to Iran that were in Syria I mean you've said that this is in part to try to deter other attacks against um US service members but but in the hours since that attack at least four times US forces were hit uh in an attack so how is this a success if these incidents keep happening over and over our goal over time is to ensure that our forces are protected and that we respond if we get hit that is what we have done that is what we will continue to do and this should be measured over the course of time not over the course of 24 hours now if Iranian proxies continue to strike American forces we will continue to respond President Biden has been straightforward about that we have followed through on that we will continue to follow through on that because the president's view is ultimately he has got to look out and Safeguard the security and the physical safety of all of our forces in both Iraq and Syria we're going to continue to do that and we have made clear that if we continue to get hit we will respond yeah got an updated timeline for when the current funding to Ukraine is going to run out so I mean there's not a literal day on the clock but but each week that passes our ability to fully fund what we feel is necessary to give Ukraine the tools and capacities it needs to both defend its territory and to continue to make advances that gets harder and harder so for us the window is closing but I cannot point to a date on the calendar because of course this is a dynamic situation and we have to make decisions about draw down packages how we size them what gets sent based on our assessment of the calendar of when we're actually going to get bill passed so I can tell you it is already having an effect on our ability uh to give Ukraine everything that it needs and that effect will only compound over time we are still able to supply uh the military assistance uh that Ukraine has been asking for but if we got the full funding we could do so on a much more certain and consistent basis and that's what we're looking for there also report that President Biden and president Chi are going to agree to a ban on the use of artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons are you able to confirm that or AI will be a part of the discussion at all of course AI will be part of the discussion but I cannot confirm that report I saw it this morning and I'm not exactly sure where it came from yeah thanks a lot Jake what's your level of confidence that China has not provided to Russia any military equipment or Munitions or technology uh as it relates to Russia's war against Ukraine our latest assessment is that Russia excuse me China has not provided weapons to Russia as part of the war in Ukraine uh but I will come back to you to confirm that that remains our latest assessment as of today because my information is a few days old and then on Gaza if I may uh what's your satisfaction level as it relates to what was announced last week this humanitarian pause would you like to see longer paaes Beyond Just 4 hours a day uh do you expect that to happen well first I think there are circumstances is where more than 4 hours a day is going to be necessary and in fact the Israeli government has recognized that they've extended some of these pauses to 7 hours for example to create the corridor so that people can move around safely We Believe pauses should not be dictated by a strict timetable they should be dictated by what is necessary to achieve the objectives and those objectives are safe passage uh the ability to move around humanitarian Aid and then ultimately we'd like to see considerably longer pauses days not hours uh in the context of a hostage release and that's being actively worked on as well yeah um on the five Army special ops horses that were killed in a helicopter crash in the Mediterranean over the weekend because they were there as part of the force buildup because of what's happening in Israel would you consider their deaths American casualties of that war I would not uh I would refer you to DOD for what the formal assessment would be but I would tell you just as a straightforward matter we have forces deployed around the world in every theater and tragically these training accidents do occur this accident did not occur in combat it occurred during a training Mission and so uh that's why from my perspective it would not be from this war yeah thank you Jake I have two questions on Gaza um 100 of stuff at the state department and usid accused the Biden administration of spreading misinformation the Israeli newspaper said actually some of the Israelis were killed were killed by Israeli Army on October 7th and the number is 1,200 not, 1400 that's not taken away from um what happened on October 7 but you were adamant that you do not trust the Palestinian sources when it comes to casualties so accurate information is vital especially when fighting anti-Semitism and islamophobia so does the white have credibility when it comes to um information and accurate information can we rely on you when you stand at the podium and tell us certain information and statements when I know information I will tell it to you when I don't know information I'm not certain about it as earlier in this uh discussion when we were talking about the number of American hostages who are still alive those who may have been actually killed by Hamas I will tell that to you if we get new information that supersedes the information we have before I will tell that to you and we have a track record from day one of this Administration to do all of those things we will continue to do that every day and I categorically reject the notion that we are pedaling any misinformation yeah you said today uh as you said a number of times about the importance of the laws of war being upheld um Israel has killed around 11,000 Palestinians around 2ir of those are women and children uh the situation in the hospitals is there Israel has dropped an astronomical amount of uh ordinance in very built up areas is Israel in your view abiding by the laws of war and if it is how you come to that conclusion well as I said yesterday I Jake Sullivan standing here am not in a position to be judge and jury to make that determination it's a legal determination what I can do is state for you the clear policy of the Biden Administration which we have been unequivocal about from the beginning of this conflict and that is that even though Hamas is using civilians as human Shields is burrowing into civilian areas with its rocket and placements that they are continuing to launch every single day at civilian areas in Israel that puts an added burden on the IDF but it does not lessen their responsibility to act in ways that separate terrorist from civilians and does everything in their power to protect civilian lives that is that was the case that remains the case today that is the message that we've said publicly and we communicate to our Israeli counterparts privately and we do that on a daily basis just tring to be clear though the administration's view is that the IDF is doing that what I told you is that I am not in a position to to give you a legal determination to your question I am not in a position to do that what I'm in a position to do is to State the US government position on how Israeli operation should be conducted and that is what I have done that is what I continue to do that is what I can do from this Podium yeah thanks Jake did Governor Gavin new give the White House a heads up on his meeting with president shei and have you guys gotten a read out from his team since and what did you make of all that we we had a heads up we got a readout in fact Ambassador Nick s accompanied that delegation on that meeting so it was fully coordinated between the governor's office and and the US state department um of course I won't get into the details of that because uh those were private diplomatic conversations but we've had a good opportunity to get a download as we have from Senator Schumer's bipartisan delegation and Senator Schumer and I actually just spoke today about some of the outcomes of that conversation which are feeding into work the president will do this week and hopefully help result in some tangible progress yeah thank you so much uh do you intend at some stage to provide more details about the kind of military equipment Israel is getting from the United States and the way it's using it uh yes the Department of Defense will lay out what we are providing to Israel I've stood up here before and told you about some of the key elements of that which have included interceptors for Iron Dome artillery ammunition Precision guide ammunitions um and so the dod on the state department will follow normal protocol in laying out the sales and transfers of weapons to Israel yeah thank you Jake I have a question on your meeting with yurac but first on the bat as I understand President we Doo will be bringing the resolution from the organization of Islamic cooperation which includes a demand for immediate ceasefire and rejection of Israel's justification that its actions in Gaza is self-defense so clearly on the international stage President Biden is losing ground on on this issue we see this at the UN every day my question is he ever at all concerned that he may be on the wrong side of History here and how does he plan to engage with President WID Doo on this issue President Biden uh is looking forward to engaging with President woto across the full range of issues in the bilateral relationship and Regional and Global issues on many issues they will agree wholeheartedly in fact they'll make significant progress on other issues they will have different perspectives president wot's position on the conflict in Gaza is well known so is President Biden they'll both have the the opportunity to respectfully exchange views on that issue they will also have the opportunity to elevate the US Indonesia bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership and to make tangible progress on issues like critical minerals like clean energy cooperation and like investment so you will see in this the the fullness of the relationship between the United States and Indonesia but also the robustness of that relationship and the way in which it is Advanced over the course of the past three years notwithstanding the fact that there are differences of perspective on certain aspects of the ongoing crisis yeah San Francisco has cleaned up their streets ahead of President Biden and president she's meeting they've moved homeless to other parts of the city cleared tent cities and trash off the street is the president embarrassed that an American city needs to go through a total makeover to be presentable for his outof town guests the president is incredibly proud of the record that the United States will bring as host to this Summit and I went through some of it today the strongest economic record of any developed country the lowest unemployment over a sustained period in half a Century far-reaching Investments in innovation in ships uh rebuilding America's infrastructure so actually the Joe Biden thinks he is walking into the summit on the front foot and able to showcase the United States as the premier destination for investment good job creating investment here in the United States all of which will be on display while he is there and the countries of the world who are coming with a recognition that the United States is in a strong indeed for a lot of people an enviable economic position and that is going to I think sustain him very effectively through the course of the week but Governor gav said of the clean up this I know folks are saying oh they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming to town that's true does President Biden agree it's more important to impress the leader of China than the American people that live in San Francisco and pay taxes every day first I completely reject the premise of your question but secondly I don't know what the context of what governor Nome said so I I won't respond to it uh last question secretary Lincoln said that we're H tunnels under schools hospitals and Mos does the US have Intelligence on this outside of what's in the public domain just so I can't speak to intelligence matters as I've said before and I feel hamstrung by that because um obviously we have intelligence sources ourselves but I'm not in a position today to be able to share that intelligence and is it fair to say the conflict in the Middle East is now on at least three fronts Israel Hamas Israel Hezbollah and US Iranian proxies I think it's I I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a three fund conflict I would accept that there is an exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah there's an obvious ongoing military operation in Gaza and yes we have been struck repeatedly by proxy groups of the irgc in Iraq and Syria and we have responded those are all that that is all correct thank you guys thank you so much Jake okay let's continue good the Supreme Court uh today unveiled the code of ethics uh on justices um there's been a lot of scrutiny of of Justice's conflict of interest um has the president have chance reviewed that does he have a position on it does he believe goes far enough so um I'm not going to get uh add more to uh or go beyond what the president has said already in the prua interview that he shared when it re when we talked about um when he was asked about the Supreme Court ethics so there are ethics rules that apply to to other and lower lower federal courts obviously and so obviously the American people have the right uh to to expect um those who are serving in high office to meet High ethics and transparency obviously standards and so but I don't have beyond that I know the president has talked about this recently and then there's a security incident overnight uh with uh the secret service agent uh apparently fired a shot U and attempted uh car vehicle theft of breaking of a secret service vle regarding one of the president's grandchildren um has the president been briefed on that incident and does he believe that secret service handled that appropriately so for any questions about uh security matters I would have to refer you to the Secret Service any questions again any questions referring to this I would have to oh I totally understand these this is personal information anything that deals with personal information I would refer you to the secret service especially as we're talking about uh security matters and lastly um Jake just said he felt hamstrung by his inability to release U us intelligence assessments of Hamas activities um has the president given any consideration to potentially be classifying that uh that intelligence we've seen downgrades uh regarding all sorts of sensitive uh us collections in the Ukraine context U but has the president considered that in uh in regards to what Hamas is doing allegedly under these hospital I just don't have anything to add to what Jake Sullivan our national security adviser shared today at the podium get nany thanks green um this year Auto thefts are way up carjackings are way up uh violent crime is way up here in DC a couple of members of Congress were attacked now this overnight How concerned is the president about the increase of crime in this City where so many government workers live so we are definitely concerned about what we're seeing and not just here across the country obviously and that's why the president's first uh first year in this Administration uh he made sure to get to pass to get past the American Rescue plan and he did that with Democrats and not one Republican vote and in that American Rescue plan there was uh there was billions of dollars that were provided uh to local cities to make sure that they were able to hire police officers and make sure that they had they felt like they could have a safer and more effective uh accountability uh Community account policing accountability and that is why he took those actions last year as you know back in August of last year he he talked about a safer safer American America plan again trying to call on Congress uh to invest over $ 3.35 billion to fund uh police and fight crime and so the president has taken actions he would like to uh do this in a bipartisan way with Republicans on the other clearly uh uh in Congress and they haven't done that and they've used this as a political weapon as a political talking point while the president has taken action to make sure our communities are safer are we concerned obviously we want to make sure Americans and their families feel safe in not just here in DC but across communities but we can't do this alone the president again has taken action he's with the American Rescue plan billions of dollars were able to go into States into communities so that they can they can provide um funding and police and police officers to make sure that their communities are safe but we need more we need Congress to act that's why he put for the safer America plan $35 billion Congress can act what does the president need to know about this laded CR before rendering a judgment on it so we're going to let the negotiations uh continue uh we're going to be in close contact with Democrats in both the house and the Senate the leadership there and have make sure that they are having their convers ation to see the best path forward for the American people and that's what the president spoke to I think there's he said there was going to a conversation happening later this afternoon or pretty much very soon and so we're just going to let that be um thanks Ken so the house plan includes no Aid to Israel or Ukraine is the White House still confident that their supplemental funding request could pass on its own and what vehicles remain here for Ukraine funding so look um Jake spoke about this very well from here and talked about the importance of making sure that we continue to fund fund Ukraine making sure that uh we have funding for Israel as well uh I'm not going to get into legislative negotiations from here from the podium but look I'm going to be very clear lives are at stake right the the National Security uh um supplemental that we put forward is incredibly important it's important for our national security uh also let's not forget the domestic uh uh supplemental as well so it's important for our needs here our needs across across the globe and so look we're going to not negotiate from here but I think Jake laid it out very clearly the importance of continuing to fund Ukraine and the importance of the funding that we've asked for Israel you've called the lad CR unserious what deal would the White House you willing to accept given all the stakes you laid out so look I mean let's be very clear here I know there's been a lot of questions on on this and the supplemental um look House Republicans are threatening a government shutdown that's what we're seeing right now that uh would hurt our economy uh that would hurt our national security as I just spoke to and in September we saw this happen where House Republicans threatened to shut down the government unless uh they got their radical uh radical demands then they shut then they shut down Congress for three uh for three chaotic weeks as they try to figure out who their next speaker was going to be after ousting the last speaker and so look you know there's work to be done they have to get the work done they got to keep the government open and so negotiations are going to be happening Democrat we're going to continue to talk to Democratic Leadership on in the house and the Senate and uh and uh and so that we can make sure that we're moving forward in a way that's that's best for the American people and as I stated the LA this latest proposal is very much untested it is it's untested and where they could have uh you know avoided this weeks ago but instead they were in their own chaos this is I'm speaking about the house of Republicans here and so we're going to continue to have those conversation with Democratic Leadership is the president concerned that City crime could get is close to his family look I'm not going to uh speak to um speak to um uh the incident that's something for Secret Service to speak to not going to talk about it from here I spoke to uh the crime more broadly and what the president has done since almost day one of his administration starting with the the his first piece of legislation that he signed into law with this which is the American Rescue plan billions of dollars going into cities going into states to make sure that they have the funding available to protect communities to hire police officers that's something that the president is concerned not just here uh in in the district but across the country as it relates to anything else uh I would have to refer you to the Secret Service na Biden had been a resident here at the White House and I wonder when did that change that she would move to her own residence with her husband this is a personal matter this is personal information certainly not going to speak from it from the podium I would have to refer you to the Secret Service one more thing president frequently talks about the fact that he speaks to his grandchildren every day do you know if he has spoken with Naomi Biden since this occurred I'm not going to get into private conversations that the president has with his family as he stated himself he is uh speaks to his grandchildren regularly he's very close to his family I'm just not going to get into uh confirming conversations with his family good follow up quick question Kelly the White House considered having mayor Bowser back over here just to talk about crime in general I know she was here I think early when the president took office but was curious any interest in maybe hearing from her we are in regular conversations with mayor Bowser about an array of issues um range of issues that uh that is important to the residents here obviously in in Washington DC that is something that is continuous we have a an a uh intergovernmental Affairs office here and so we are in touch with her as mayor of DC but also other Mayors and governors across uh across the country uh look I've said this moments ago and I'll say it again we've been very serious on dealing with uh the crime that we have seen just across the country and we'd love to work with Republicans on this they have not been serious on this uh the president again put forth the American Rescue plan signed that into law put billions of dollars into communities to help uh help Mayors and and uh and governors deal with crime in their city and their states but Republicans aren't serious he put forth the safer America's plan $35 billion to continue to invest and make sure that we're actually dealing with this type of crime we don't hear anything from them so House Republicans more broadly in Congress if they want to get this done we're willing to work with them I'm going to keep going I'm going to keep I'm going to keep I'm going keep going Chang thanks K meta platform said that it's going to require advertisers disclose when artificial intelligence or other digital tools are used in Facebook or Instagram ads on social issues elections and politics I wanted to find out what President Biden thinks about that uh so don't have anything to share on their new policy uh meta's new policy obviously the president put forward a pretty comprehensive uh AI uh executive order recently uh and so outside of that I'm just not going to not going to really comment on private uh entities and and actions that they're taking but obviously the president takes this very seriously and you could see that with the comprehensive uh executive order that he put forward uh that touches on many uh many important uh many important parts of different Industries obviously the the goal here is to protect Americans could you speak more broadly about what the president thinks social media platform should be doing within the next couple months to prepare for potential AI generated misinformation on their platforms especially going into an election season so I'm going to be very careful because you're asking me about election season don't want to speak to that from here uh obviously we take this very seriously because we put forth an executive order very recently uh that is seen as being uh comprehensive that is seen as being transformative uh and that is something that we can do here from the federal government uh I'm just not going to talk about private companies from here and what they're going to do in uh in the upcoming election thank you Ken I wanted to follow up on the twostep uh C that Republicans are putting uh out you've previously said that this would be a recipe for chaos and more shutdowns I'm wondering what the president's message is to um those house Democrats who seem at least intrigued by this proposal for instance uh Minnesota representative Dean Phillips uh has said the speaker Johnson's twep CR quote isn't perfect but a whole lot better than a shutdown so look the latest proposal as I just said is definitely untested and that's true it is untested uh we are going to continue and this is something that the president was saying in the Oval Office just moments ago before we came out to the uh into the briefing rooms we're going to be in touch with a Democratic Leadership in both the house and the Senate and uh our goal our number one goal is to make sure that we move uh we take the best path forward uh for the American people that's what we're going to focus on but it is this is indeed untested uh and uh that is uh that is something that uh we're seeing coming from them and look this is something that they could avoid it and instead of avoiding where we are right now just a couple days away from a government shutdown they've wasted time they have wasted time so Democratic Leadership is going to have that conversation in both the house and the the Senate on how to best the move forward there was there was an update I just wanted the uh house oversight committee has now issued a subpoena for the former White House Council Dana Remis they're also asking for four other transcribed interviews with White House employees regarding the classified documents that were found in Boba or in Wilmington I'm just curious would the White House support cooperating with the committee's oversight specifically with this subpoena for Dana remas I'm just not going to comment from here which is consistent with what we've been doing from here go ahead thank you follow up on on Phil's question uh will the house Democrats uh know the president's position on whether or not he would sign that continuing resolution before they have to vote on it well the president literally just talked about this one of your colleagues asked uh asked him about this particular CR and he said that he wants to there there's going to be conversations on the hill negotiations on the hill and he wants to talk to uh the leadership and so that's in the Democratic House and Senate and that's what we're going to do don't have any anything else to share I'm just going to go to the back go ahead in the back thanks GRE uh some Democrats particularly in and around the squad have openly disagreed with the president for being too supportive of Israel there's also been some grassroot groups that backed the president and are now indicating that this could be a deal

and I'm Carol Coleman welcome into yeah a brand new week here on first at 4 yeah it's a beautiful day out there today lots of sunshine Dakota yes so we do have that Sun out there but boy it is windy uh and I mean you know when I came in um you know the the the leaves were blowing around I almost got knocked on my keyer coming in because it was like whoa and it makes it feel pretty chilly out there the good news is temperatures are going up in that yes yes temperatures are going up through at least the middle part of this week but then we bring them on down once again later on in the week um as AJ said at noon today almost everything but the kitchen sink kind of in the 7-day forecast that he was looking at but we're looking ahead to Wednesday and weather looks nice for our food drive day want to remind you it's our big annual food drive coming up on Wednesday 11 or so locations where you can drop off non- perishable food items and uh donations and usually uh the drive up part is really nice because it's usually freezing and and snowing some days this year a little bit different which we'll get in that forecast coming up in just a little bit well right now let's take a look at Who's Who on first at four for today and our community guests include Lisa D Filippo who will join us from the manufacturer and Business Association to discuss food safety ahead of next week's big Thanksgiving Day preparation also Christine Bowen will be in with all the details on the ahn's 39th Annual Festival of trees that's the big one happening next weekend at the Bayfront Convention Center bless local DJs From classy 100 Brenda Celli and Britney Dixon will sit down on the blue couches to talk about the effect that Taylor Swift has on the airway now we are kicking off Taylor Swift week the Taylor Swift phenomenon here on first 4 this week and also marer will be in to talk about the D marks squaring the circle Fall fundraiser uh that's coming up on Friday night yeah big big hour ahead for you hope you'll stay with us the whole time let's get to a little bit of all that weather all things good outside yes uh I mean you know we've got that Sunshine out there we're going to still have clear skies through the evening but things will change all right I'm assuming our walk up music today is probably a Taylor Swift song right you got it Dakota okay I know the song yes this is an early one yep love story you got it love story yeah this this was really one of her big hits uh from early on 2008 when she was just kind of breaking onto this this was from her country era right yes we thought appr and I mean you know I will say I was a huge fan of Taylor Swift in her early days days when she was country I kind of lost interest with Taylor Swift after she transitioned to pop music but that's a different story uh you don't want to hear that what you want to hear me is talking about the weather and uh yeah we've got that Sunshine out there it is Breezy and uh the winds will subside as we go into the later part of the day let's take a live look outside at the uh Ravine flyer camera overlooking pryle and I've been seeing the camera bouncing in the wind and you can see those white caps on the lake telling you it is Breezy out there temperature right now 51 degre so it is seasonable but notice that weather impact all green we are good you can see Doppler Max is quiet and as I mentioned last night Doppler Max will have no work to do over the next couple of days it's going to be dry and really gorgeous through the next few days 51 here in the city 52 Gerard 52 out there also in Bradford 51 in Warren so temperatures are closely packed together there are winds coming out of the West averaging about 15 to 20 M an hour those are the sustained wind speeds but when you look at the wind gust well looking at gust about 25 we did see a wind gust of around 30 uh earlier this afternoon so we are starting to see those winds die down a little bit clear skies through this evening clouds thicking up by tomorrow morning but when does our next chance of rain arrive I'll give you those details with first war weather futurecast coming up in just a few minutes all right thanks Dakota let's get started now with our top four at four headline stories for this Monday afternoon and we begin with Eerie police who are looking for a driver of a car that drove on to the brand new B nof field outside of eerie High it happened about 7:00 last night according to the district the car left the area before officers arrived they say they're in the process of reviewing surveillance video and in the meantime have tightened the fencing around the field yeah luckily according to the district a contractor who is completing that work over on the field has determined uh that there's no damage to the actual field you can see some of the tire marks kind of surrounding it there uh but as we've been reporting that brand new turf was laid down at the end of August August all part of a $6 million renovation to that field of course Erie native and Pro Football Hall of Famer Fred bnov uh is the inspiration behind all this came home earlier this year to raise money for that project but again police still searching for that driver what a dumb thing to do and with cameras everywhere they will find that driver all right whether you're driving or flying get ready for crowds heavy traffic and long lines this Thanksgiving tripa a says it's going to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel day in several years triaa says a total of nearly 55.4 million people are expected to be traveling between the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after the holiday and that includes upwards of 49 million Americans driving yeah in the skies airlines are expecting a record setting number of passengers over nearly a two- week period including the weekend before Thanksgiving which is that weekend coming up uh in just a couple of days uh and the days after uh there is some good news though if you're traveling by car gas is down triaa says the national average has dropped 5 cents since last week to $336 a gallon that's 26 Cents less than a month ago and 41 cents less a gallon than a year ago now here in Eerie Triple A says the average is about $367 a gallon speaking of holidays if your favorite holiday tradition is grabbing a blanket a hot drink and the television remote this might be the perfect job for you cable tv.com is looking for a chief of cheer to watch 25 holiday movies in 25 days The Chosen candidate has to keep track of each film and rank them based on Nostalgia heartwarming storytelling and holiday cheer I might have already done that so far you just you can just write it up I'm up in probably the teens uh for their work though the chief of cheer will get $2500 plus a year subscription to seven streaming services uh the best part is there's no list that you have to stick to the the winner gets to pick their favorite holiday movies whether that's a Hallmark romcom or animated classic or an action thriller like die hard that's controversial is it a Christmas movie or not uh cabletv.com though is accepting those applications on their website through December first interesting and we think we know the answer to this next question but would you spend $230 on scented water for your infant the luxury brand Dior is banking on customers answer yes to that one they've launched a new skin care line specifically for babies babies are the one group who don't need skare you you have skin like a baby uh it has a lot of people shaking their heads including the man next to me I'd imagine uh it's cented water is its priciest item followed by a moisturizer for $150 for babies the line also includes cleansers for 95 bucks a pop Dior says their new products are a revamp if it's 1970s perfume line for infants I don't know why you'd want to use perfume but what do you suppose is scented water for infants I don't understand what that is on a baby I don't maybe when you're cleaning them up after a diaper change I mean they do stink sometimes but like we were saying the stuff you can get it yeah baby magic is work just fine Ethan anything to say on this one nothing that would mean that I would have a job tomorrow okay so we'll Reserve judgment 115 Buck cleanser for bab people have earned the money they are free to spend it h true and there are some people who would definitely bathe their babies into your water they will for True all right uh you're here to talk about uh that tops location on West 26 Street the tops know more but we now know what's going in that spot not one not two but three businesses how about that uh the big one there that that has probably the most people talking gr Grocery Outlet it's a chain of stores there's a couple south of here Dorman Ohio Newcastle but they're throughout the country and so we'll have one in eie here by this spring so obviously it's not going to be the size of tops if you're going to put three businesses in there the grocery store is not going to be the same size but it should offer access to fresh fruits and vegetables fresh meat the sorts of things that you can't get at say a dollar store although a dollar store is actually one of the other businesses going in along with the fitness center and and the big controversy behind that tops closing there was that it was leaving a food desert for the folks who lived in that area uh this should alleviate that fingers anyway we'll have to see what comes in at this grocery store just to be sure of that but presumably yes and that's great news for folks living in that area I talked to some today who don't drive and who used to walk to Tops and you know a couple block walk is no big deal a couple mile walk trying to carry your weeks worth of groceries so you can't run over to the grocery store that's a big deal yeah um you know when I visited friends who lived like in New York City I could never understand how they grocery shopped because you know that's how we do it here you go once a week you have bags and bags and bags um but you know other people kind of get into a routine where maybe they go a few times a week and they walk and they just have a couple bags to carry so maybe some changes like that will happen as well did that particular store did it have a pharmacy and is there now a missing Pharmacy don't know on that is a really good question but there's a CVS right in that Plaza so that shouldn't be a concern to get any prescription switched over but the biggest thing is just not having to buy your groceries at a dollar store because you're so limited there and some sometimes you can get a great deal at a dollar store but other times you actually are paying more per unit it's just a smaller thing so you end up paying more over time and your nutritional options are limited and what do we know about the fitness center moving into that space not much at this point I we'll keep you posted on that it should all be good to go by May is spring is sort of the timeline so the idea is try to get as much as much done as you can now on the exterior and then of course you work on the interior when the weather's not so nice interesting all right good news for a lot of folks in that in that media time the building doesn't sit empty provides fresh food double thumbs stay empty for long that's for sure all right thanks Ethan well still to come here on first at 4 it's a post Thanksgiving tradition for so many local families Festival of trees kicking off of course the day after turkey day down at the Bayfront Convention Center there's trees and shopping and Santa and we're going to hear all about it coming up next and live reindeer yes that's right Dakota will also be back with your full forecast much more first at four still to come I think I'm going to order another one of these I like this cup so much really cute I'm going to what do I got going on there thank you you're welcome thank you you're welcome I got you oh [Music] now first warning weather with Dakota Hunter welcome back everybody live look at the Gary Miller at the mall sky cam overlooking Peach Street and traffic is Flowing out there this afternoon as people are heading home from work maybe getting ready to get their dinner plans going and we are looking good no other hassles to really talk about for tonight the only thing we're going to maintain is really the winds through the rest of the afternoon and the evening we could be talking about gusts around 25 to 35 so it's still going to be a bit Breezy but again those winds are going to start to subside as we go into tonight and into tomorrow but that Sunshine it continues to smile down on you as we go through the next couple of days so really this is just a stretch of gorgeous weather for us for Mid November you really don't think about this kind of weather for November but we do see more rain returning as we go into Friday and Saturday so those are going to be the two wetest days over the next uh several days all right we talked about this at the top of the show and again big deal we have the Eerie news now food drive coming up on Wednesday and you know this is one of the ways that we try to give back uh uh to the local community and you know I was mentioning it all weekend long it's easy sometimes to forget about the people less fortunate in our community because we get so caught up in our own personal problems that sometimes we forget that there's people less fortunate and uh this food drive will obviously benefit the Thanksgiving Day holiday we've got drop off locations across Erie County Crawford County Warren and mcken counties and we and we're also accepting donations here at the station from 6:00 a.m. to 6:30 and we are looking good and that's 6:30 p.m by the way and we're looking good uh basically lots of sunshine temperatures mid to Upper 50s maybe a 60 in some spots so again looking great Doppler Max again quiet as I mentioned it's not going to have much to do over the next couple of days cuz high pressure built in across the upper Great Lakes see all this uh rain and snow shower activity that's pushing on up towards New England and as moving away from us so that's not going to be a threat to us here's our crime victim Center sky cam showing that Sunshine across downtown Erie 51 but notice that west southwest wind averaging 14 so the winds still are up and as I mentioned that's going to continue through the evening hours notice a little bit of cloudiness coming in at around 7 o'clock tonight but we'll still be mainly clear the clouds do thicken up overnight and into tomorrow morning so we'll call it a partly to mostly cloudy start and then as we go into the afternoon look at this no clouds to be had just a lot of sunshine and that's going to continue through Wednesday and Thursday and those temperatures bump up a little bit more each and every day so it's going to feel good now the winds we're going to start to see those winds still around 20 25 mph on the wind gust but then they will start to subside as we head into Tuesday notice here by uh 8: a.m. wind gust starting to fall below the well Breezy conditions we'll call it that so we'll put the high temp for tomorrow at 48 a mix of sun and clouds lots of sunshine as we go into Wednesday Thursday how about lower 60s yeah that's going to feel good but notice here as we go into Friday temperatures come back down into the mid to Upper 50s with occasional to widespread showers Karen Amanda yeah but anything leading up to that I mean in mid November like you mentioned Dakota that is just bonus I know for us here it's good thanks Dakota we're going to welcome in our first guest today Christine Bowen from Ahn is joining us now to talk about the 39th Annual Festival of trees 39 years this has been a tradition in Eerie it sure is a community tradition everyone loves it we're excited to have everyone back this year it probably would be 40 years if it weren't for that pesky Co right did you skip a year no we had after Co we did it Outdoors so we're glad to be back inside where it's warm yeah terrific powered on there was so much to do at this event and it seems like every year it truly does get a little bit bigger it does you know what we have something for everyone from the young to the young at heart um a six room Santa's Castle live reindeer train rides vendors that everyone can enjoy to get all your holiday shopping done and of course 80 professionally decorated trees yes beautiful trees jaw-dropping I mean every year I'm like oh man now I got to go decorate mine that's going to just fall flat uh talk about some of those that are returning to to decorate a tree this year so our decorators are absolutely fabulous we actually have some new ones that I'm really excited about so we always get members from the community who are at home decorators

check out I will tell say this year we have 83 trees um which is more than ever before so a lot for everyone to take in and then the community gets to vote on their favorite and that's how we get our

but if the intensity remains low, flooding won't be ...", "video_transcript": "this rain I kind of like this weather no it's not bad I it's gloomy yes it's not going to last forever and we're not getting a deluge of rain where flooding is an issue it's kind of a lowend threat for any minor Street flooding what about tomorrow well it's going to continue overnight and into tomorrow but thankfully the rainfall rates rainfall totals don't look to be all that high so kind of a steady light rainfall we definitely need a lot more but we'll take it in small doses and we're getting some of that light to moderate rain at the moment maybe a few pockets of some slightly heavier show hours but for the most part it's been a fairly light steady rain which with that Gulf low still well offshore will continue through the overnight and into much of the day tomorrow now our model I was showing you was indicating maybe some breaks in the rainfall certainly a wet night overnight but maybe some breaks as we get the day started tomorrow we'll see if the timing really holds out and then more development as that low will still be down to our South during the day tomorrow and then finally starting to taper off probably late Tuesday night more so into early Wednesday and still may have a few pop-up showers kind of on the wraparound side from this low during the day Wednesday but not nearly as high rain coverage on Wednesday and then continuing to dry out as we head into Thursday and Friday one other issue with the low in its position is we do have a strong northeasterly wind if we do have times pick up a little bit more of an easterly component that could send some of our areas highlighted in yellow here for some coastal flooding the coastal flood warning is in effect through Wednesday night those parishes and counties highlighted in green Coastal flood advisory because of the position and the wind direction probably won't be as much of an issue but with that water kind of piling up along all of these shorelines we will likely see some higher water levels especially at high tide temperatures though at the moment 50s and low 60s if nothing else it really is helping to keep us much cooler today did briefly get up to 66 degrees but look at that time 126 so it was before any of the rainfall got started once the rainfall moved in that was about it temperature stayed upper 50s and lower 6 or I should say dropped to the upper 50s and low 60s low clouds but no fog this is just kind of a low Cloud deck and our temperature currently is at 63 with obviously high humidity with all the rainfall around we'll stay rainy overnight tonight and for much of the day on Tuesday then the rain gone early Wednesday May still see some popup scattered showers during the day but the bulk of the rainfall will be moving on and then we also have a cold front on the way for this weekend which will help to clear us out and also bring our temperatures down a little bit here's the culprit big upper level low that is what is developing the surface low over the Gulf Waters as this little feature continues moving to the east it actually is thankful it is not a position farther north models had been doing a real difficult time uh as of late last week and even early this weekend of exactly where that surface low would go it is offshore that's where the more intense rainfall is and also the real risk of any severe weather don't want have to deal with any of that don't want have to deal with any flooding and thankfully that looks to stay just south of our Coastline as as we head into the day tomorrow as the low continues pushing off to the east it will start to take the bulk of the rainfall with it and again Wednesday May see some kind of wrap around moisture keeping our rain chances spotty to scattered rain Chan or rain coverage I should say is about 100% rainfall totals have been decreasing a little bit models on the high and 1 in mainly from the River Parishes Northshore Florida parishes and even down the bayou and then a little closer to the center of that low 2 to three Ines of rainfall at the trend we're going right now unless the intensity start picking up we're probably not even going to see that much as most locations have only seen about 2/10 of an inch of rainfall so we'll see where we end up but our rainfall deficit for the month is still over an inch below average but for the year we're nearing 30 in below normal we'll keep our rain chances on the high side tonight and tomorrow about 100% coverage then they'll start tapering off by Wednesday drier Thursday Friday weak front moves through doesn't look like we're going to get any rain fall with this one but note our morning low temperatures will start dropping and then it does look like by late Monday into Tuesday of next week another storm system approaches and brings us another chance of rain before Thanksgiving", "aigc_title": "Light Rain to Persist

by Buffalo Bills Insider and friend of the show Vic kuchi Vic the bills are not in the best shape right now they're one game above 500 they've already lost a few games they were expected to win what is at stake if the team doesn't show up again tonight and they lose versus arguably one of the worst teams in the league yeah and and I think that's the whole big picture here is the situation they find themselves when it's expectations vers versus reality the reality is the the 5-4 record while not a killer for the season and like you said they're only a game behind the Dolphins and all that but it is the way they've gotten here and these last five games that have been troubling and the of course the proliferation of injuries on defense but we've just seen too much of the struggles even in games they've won and this is as long a stretch of sort of mediocrity from this team that we really haven't seen for the better part of the last few seasons pick another big question the season is the offense we talked about this earlier in the season yet here we are again same questions can the offense rebound tonight and if it doesn't does it mean that we've overestimated the offense or is there something that's stunning its growth yeah and and we can include the bills because there's been of course some pretty big investment there the contract that Josh Allen has the expectation that he's going to perform like a franchise quarter back on a consistent basis Stefon Diggs the other pieces to this offense uh the reparations or or additions and and subtractions I guess to the offensive line to to get it right all of that adds up to a team that was expected to be better offensively than we have seen to date and Josh throwing those interceptions overshadowing the other production he has which is you know that of a guy who can run and score with his arm or his legs but we're not seeing this enough and we're certainly not seeing it uh enough in the first half that's seven points for instance against the Bengals that has been part of a troubling Trend the slow starts you're right about that and oh we when we talk about those uh interceptions but let's go to the other side of the ball the defense the bills have a lot of injuries causing their one solid defense to be filled with some cracks again the Broncos they're bad but they do have a Super Bowl winner at quarterback and Russell and as their head coach how much could those injuries hurt them tonight and that's what you really are going to be looking at in this game of course again the given is can Buffalo's offense function well and and when they're in Orchard Park they tend to do that but it's about this defense that could go into this game with as many as six starters out of the lineup we're talking five already uh Christian Benford of course has excuse me um Terrell Bernard uh dealing with a concussion benford's out at corner but Bernard with the concussion that could bring that total up to a very alarmingly high level uh add to that Von Miller does he turn the corner from his continued recovery from a knee injury Russell Wilson uh is at his best can be a great quarterback was with Seattle hasn't quite consistently been there for the Broncos this year but uh I'll tell you what the last couple of games especially that Kansas City game he looked like The Wil Wilson of old and Shawn pyton uh knows a thinger to about coaching successful offenses you're right about that it's not going to be easy as people may think so if the team if the bills lose is this going to be the last straw who's going to be the blame could we see something happening on Tuesday morning you know Claudine uh what you bring up is very fair I think because it is on the collective mind I think of everyone who cares about the Buffalo Bills that this would feel if it's not rock bottom it is as close to Rock Bottom as you can get in November before Thanksgiving um a a loss would be so hard to look at and feel like there is going to be progression from here again mathematically they're out of nothing but it would I think seal the idea that if they don't win their division the path to the playoffs would be so difficult as say a wild card team and then what kind of team if we're talking playoffs should we even use the term playoffs if they come out of Orchard Park on a Monday night with a loss I I yeah very difficult I think for anyone to Fathom you said changes well they'd be called for by a lot of those talk show callers and such and social media whether there would be any actual reaction we'll see yeah you're right about that Vic and bills Mafia they're going to be talking that talk tomorrow no matter what so it's going to be interesting to see exactly what plays out on the field as always you

BE THANKFUL TO GET ANY RAIN, THOUGH, OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AS WE DO HAVE DRY SKIES IN THE FORECAST FOR MOST OF THIS WEEK AS WELL. DRIEST NOVEMBER SINCE 2000 WAS 2012. THAT'S WHEN WE HAD ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF RAIN. LAST TIME WE HAD A MONTH THAT WAS LESS THAN AN INCH. WELL, THAT WAS NOVEMBER. IN 2021, WHERE WE HAD JUST OVER A QUARTER OF AN INCH RAINFALL. SO FAR THIS MONTH IS A TRACE. OUR NEXT RAIN CHANCE COMES ON FRIDAY. NOW, TYPICALLY OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER, THEY ARE SOME OF OUR DRIEST MONTHS ON AVERAGE AT JUST OVER THREE INCHES OF RAIN. NOW, WE ARE WELL BELOW THAT RIGHT NOW. NOW, OF COURSE, WITH NOVEMBER ONLY SEEING A TRACE OF RAIN, WE ARE ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF BELOW NORMAL FOR THE MONTH. ALREADY DRY THROUGH THURSDAY. SCATTERED SHOWERS ON FRIDAY. OF COURSE, WITH THE DRY CONDITIONS WE HAVE THE DROUGHT AND FIRE CONCERNS THAT CONTINUE TO MOSTLY DRY AND SEASONABLE FOR THIS WEEK. SEASONABLE HIGHS ARE IN THE LOW 60S. WE WERE AT 63 TODAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES USUALLY AVERAGING IN THE UPPER 30S AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME 30S AGAIN TONIGHT. AND THEN TOMORROW NIGHT, OF COURSE, WITH THE SUN GOING DOWN, WE'RE HAVING THOSE TEMPS DROP OFF PRETTY QUICKLY. SO WE'RE 53IN YANCEYVILLE RIGHT NOW, 50 IN ASHEBORO, MOCKSVILLE AT 55. AND TEMPS THAT ARE IN THE 40S AND 50S AS YOU TRAVEL UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS, WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW 46 AT BEECH MOUNTAIN, 51 IN SPARTA, AS WELL AS PILOT MOUNTAIN. YOU CAN SEE ACTUALLY SOME FAIRLY MILD AIR THAT EXTENDS ALL THE WAY WEST TO THE ROCKIES. SO WE'RE GOING TO STAY FAIRLY MILD. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THIS RAIN IS STAYING WELL TO OUR SOUTH NOW, THERE ARE SOME DROUGHT CONCERNS DOWN THERE AS WELL. SO THEY'RE LUCKY TO GET THOSE RAINDROPS. WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET SOME PASSING CLOUDS IN HERE. WE'VE GOT A FEW OF THEM IN RIGHT NOW. IT'LL BE MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT. TEMPERATURES DROPPING THROUGH THE 40S THIS EVENING AND THEN DOWN INTO THE MID TO UPPER 30S FOR TOMORROW MORNING WITH SOME PATCHY CLOUD COVER AROUND, OFF AND ON THROUGHOUT THE DAY TOMORROW. SO NOT AS MUCH BLUE TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE LOW 60S, KIND OF SIMILAR TO TODAY. WE MIGHT GET A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER. WE'VE GOT KIND OF A COOL NORTHEAST BREEZE TOMORROW ALONG WITH THE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. SO THAT'LL INHIBIT TOO MUCH WARMING. WE'VE GOT 64 FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON. RAIN IN THE TRIAD, 63 IN OUR FOOTHILL COMMUNITIES WITH A CHILLY START IN THE 30S AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. WE'LL BE ABOUT 35 TO START. AND THEN WE SHOULD GET UP AND OVER 60 DEGREES, OR AT LEAST RIGHT AT IT BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WEDNESDAY IS GOING TO BE A CLOUDY DAY. IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A PRETTY COOL DAY. I DON'T THINK THE HIGHS ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE 50S ON WEDNESDAY. SO THAT'S PROBABLY YOUR COLDEST DAY OF THE WEEK. THURSDAY, WE MAY THIN THE CLOUD COVER OUT AND WARM UP SOME INTO THE UPPER 60S. AND THEN BY FRIDAY MORNING, WE'RE WAITING ON THIS FRONTIER. WE'VE GOT OVERCAST SKIES, SOME PATCHY LIGHT RAIN PERHAPS KIND OF OFF AND ON DURING THE DAY AND THEN LOOKING FOR A LINE OF SHOWERS TO COME IN AND ONCE AGAIN KIND OF FALL APART AS IT MOVES INTO THE MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT, FRIDAY INTO EARLY SATURDAY.

AMNA: WELCOME TO THE NEWSHOUR. GAZA'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, AND ITS CENTRAL HOSPITAL, ARE IN COLLAPSE, MORE THAN 5 WEEKS SINCE THE HAMAS TERROR ATTACKS THAT SPARKED THIS WAR. THOSE WHO CAN STILL LEAVE NORTHERN GAZA ARE STREAMING SOUTH. GEOFF: LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN AGAIN STARTS OUR COVERAGE, AFTER SPENDING HALF OF TODAY IN GAZA WITH THE ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES. AN EDITORIAL NOTE, THE IDF REVIEWED THE VIDEO NEWSHOUR RECORDED IN GAZA, THEY SAY, FOR THE OPERATIONAL SECURITY OF THEIR TROOPS. THE IDF HAD NO EDITORIAL ROLE IN THIS STORY PRIOR TO ITS BROADCAST. LEILA: THERE ARE NO ROADS LEFT HERE. AS WE CROSS THE BORDER INTO GAZA, LEAVING THE SAME DIRT TRACK HORDES OF HAMAS TERRORISTS USED TO INVADE ISRAELI TOWNS ON OCTOBER 7TH, THE LANDSCAPE BECOMES LITTLE MORE THAN DUST. TOWNS IN THIS AREA WERE FLATTENED AS ISRAELI TROOPS FOUGHT HAMAS MILITANTS IN THE EARLY WEEKS OF THE WAR. WE WERE GIVEN ACCESS TO EMBED WITH THE IDF INSIDE GAZA, SUBJECT TO ISRAELI MILITARY RESTRICTIONS. SO THAT'S THE BORDER OVER THERE. >> YES THAT'S THE BORDER. YOU CAN SEE THE BORDER. YOU CAN SEE ALL THE KIBBUTZES THAT HAVE BEEN ATTACKED. >> THE IDF BELIEVES JUDOR AD DIK, A FARMING VILLAGE ONCE HOME TO 5,000 PEOPLE, WAS A KEY PLANNING AND STAGING OUTPOST FOR THE ATTACKS. >> A LOT OF OUTPOSTS, AND ANTI-TANK MISSILES, THAT WE FOUND HERE. MANY HOUSES WERE BOOBY-TRAPPED, WITH WIRES THAT EXPLODED BEFORE THE IDF SOLDIERS COULD GET INSIDE. >> GILAD SAYS THIS IS JUST ONE THE MANY LOCATIONS WHERE TUNNELS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FOUND AND CAPPED, BUT THEY KNOW THEY'RE CONNECTED TO HUNDREDS OF MILES MORE BENEATH THE STRIP. >> WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF HOLES AND TUNNELS THAT HAMAS HAS BUILT IN THE GROUND THROUGH THE YEARS IN ORDER TO MAKE ALL OF GAZA HUGE TERROR COMPOUND. IN JUST THIS VILLAGE WE FOUND FIVE PIT HOLES, THREE MAIN TUNNELS, UNDER CIVILIANS' HOUSES. LEILA: THEY SAY THEY CAN'T SHOW US THESE TUNNELS BECAUSE THERE'S A RISK THERE ARE STILL ACTIVE FIGHTERS INSIDE. >> EACH TUNNEL HAS A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. FOR EXAMPLE THE TUNNELS WE FOUND HERE WE CALL CLOSING TUNNELS, CLOSE TO THE BORDER, CLOSE TO THE IDF, ALLOWING THEM TO FLANK OR INFILTRATE THEM BENEATH AND STRIKE THEM. IT'S VERY LIKELY TO SAY WE ARE STANDING RIGHT NOW BUT -- ABOVE TUNNELS WE HAVEN'T FOUND YET. BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND THEM SOONER OR LATER. LEILA: IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE ANYONE COULD LIVE HERE AGAIN. THE SCALE OF THE DESTRUCTION HERE AND IN SO MANY OTHER VILLAGES ALONG GAZA'S BORDER WITH ISRAEL IS COMPLETE. EVERY HOUSE IS GUTTED. THE U.N.'S HUMANITARIAN OFFICE SAYS 45% OF GAZA'S HOMES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DAMAGED OR COMPLETELY DESTROYED. AS WE ROLL FURTHER INSIDE THE STRIP, THE NAVIGATOR TRACKS THE TERRAIN THROUGH THE SIGHTS OF THIS ARMOURED VEHICLE, A WASTELAND OF TWISTED METAL AND DIRT, ALMOST UNRECOGNISABLE AS AN AREA WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ONCE LIVED. SUDDENLY, AN URGENT CALL ON THE RADIO. A SOLDIER'S BEEN WOUNDED AT THE LOCATION WE'RE HEADED TO. THE TEAM'S JUST HAD A CALL THAT ONE OF THE SOLDIERS SECURING THE HUMAN AND -- HUMANITARIAN QUARTER HAS BEEN SHOT POSSIBLY BY A SNIPER. THEY'RE TRYING TO ARRANGE AN EVACUATION. >> WE'RE COORDINATING BETWEEN THE WOUNDED SOLDIER, THE CHOPPER AND THE CAR. THE CONVOY WILL TAKE THE CASUALTY OUT TOWARDS THE BORDER. LEILA: AHEAD, EMERGING OVER THE CREST OF A MILITARY OUTPOST, 1000 CIVILIANS ON FOOT WEIGHED , DOWN NOT BY THE MEAGER BAGS THEY CARRY, BUT BY WEEKS OF CONSTANT FEAR AND DEVASTATING LOSS. AS ISRAEL CONTINUES ITS BOMBARDMENT OF GAZA BY AND LAND, -- BY AIR AND LAND, BEHIND ME YOU CAN SEE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO EVACUATE DOWN THE MAIN NORTH-SOUTH HIGHWAY. THEY ARE WEARY AND HUNGRY. IN THE BACKGROUND YOU CAN HEAR GUNFIRE, WHICH THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IS HAMAS MILITANTS FIGHTING WITH ISRAELI SOLDIERS AS THEY TRY TO STOP CIVILIANS EVACUATING. SOLDIERS TAKE COVER TO SECURE THE PASSAGE. THE IDF CALL OUT IN HEBREW AND ENGLISH, HOPING TO FIND HOSTAGES HIDDEN IN THE CROWDS AND SIGNAL -HOUR DAILY COMBAT PAUSES FOR EVACUATIONS HAVE BEEN AGREED, BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM YET. ABU SHADY SAYS HIS COMMUNITY HAS SUFFERED BEYOND IMAGINING, AND NOW FACES A LONG WALK IN TO THE UNKNOWN. >> WE HAVE NO FOOD OR WATER, AND WE ARE DISPLACED FROM OUR HOME, OUR BUILDING WAS DESTROYED WITH OUR BELONGINGS INSIDE. I'M FLEEING WITH NO CLOTHES. WE ARE ALL WITHOUT CLOTHES AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WHAT WE CAN DO? LEILA: WHAT CONDITION ARE THE CIVILIANS YOU SEE CROSSING HERE IN? >> I THINK THE PEOPLE HERE KNOW THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. THEY ARE WAITING FOR THEM ON THE SOUTH PART OF THE STRIP WITH HAVENS, TENTS AND WATER AND FOOD. LEILA: THESE PEOPLE HOPE, AND HAVE BEEN TOLD, THAT BY FLEEING SOUTH, THEY MAY LOSE THEIR HOMES, BUT THEY'LL SAVE THEIR LIVES. BUT GAZANS WHO'VE ALREADY REACHED THE SOUTH SAY THE BOMBARDMENT IS NEARLY AS BAD, AND THE LIVING CONDITIONS UNBEARABLE. AND WHY ARE FEARS THE -- HE FEARS THE WORST IS YET TO COME. >> I WAS IN AL-SHIFA. I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE A SAFE PLACE FOR US AND OTHER CITIZENS, BUT IT WAS NOT A SAFE PLACE. THIS PLACE IS NOT SAFE, EITHER. THERE IS BOMBING EVERYWHERE, THERE IS NO MERCY. THESE ARE MASS MASSACRES. LEILA: THE IDF SAYS IT IS DOING ITS BEST TO MINIMISE CASUALTIES, BUT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO ERADICATE HAMAS, IN SPITE OF THE CIVILIAN TOLL. ISRAELIS, OFTEN AT ODDS OVER INTERNAL POLITICS, ARE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY UNITED OVER THIS WAR, WHICH THEY SEE AS A FIGHT FOR THE VERY SURVIVAL OF THEIR COUNTRY.

There's definitely a lot of animals that are being surrendered or people are trying to surrender them shelter cages in the state are fuller than they have been in years. Pushing leaders in Colorado's no kill shelter movement to suggest a new law. This bill that we're looking to forward in the legislature. This session is essentially a requirement that shelters and rescues in Colorado work together. Max Fund, Executive Director Kathy Gaines says the proposed legislation would require any shelter that is about to put a healthy and treatable animal down for any reason to post notice for 72 hours, giving other shelters and rescues the opportunity to step in. They're going to give shelters and rescues in Colorado the opportunity to pull that animal if they have space for it, if they have the staffing for it, lawmakers are still in the process of drafting it. But she says the bill has several sponsors. The fear is we have around bills like this is that they position shelters as bad actors and kind of in some sort of um you know, negative relationship with rescues potential opponents like Rachel Heatley with the Denver Dumb Friends League say if the bill looks like a similar one floated in California this year, some shelters have concerns. There is the possibility with a bill like this, that less resource shelters could run into a problem where in order to make space for the animals they're holding for those 72 hours, they would need to euthanize the animals in their here uh to make that space available. Haines says this isn't about a difference in philosophy. This is from our perspective, legislation that is not specific to any sheltering model. It's more just asking for transparency among shelters and rescues. So Colorado doesn't release data on reasons for euthanization of shelter animals. So a lot of what you hear is purely anecdotal. So all of that would have to be sorted out through a rule making process if this bill passes, how do you enforce this? What's the penalty for a shelter that puts a healthy and treatable pet down without providing notice. A lot of unanswered questions about this still in the drafting stages, but an interesting concept, Tom. Yeah, like so many rules and laws though, for many people, it's strictly about the animals. It's a more of a heart issue than it is a head issue if you will. So, uh we'll be following this and see how people react to it.

the job Laurel Darren of Wild Bunch Desert Guides gave herself.", "video_transcript": "hi everybody I'm your host Jamie seretta on this podcast we celebrate everything local here in Arizona and that is something that my next guest does every single day when she hits the trails I want to introduce you to Laurel Darren of Wild Bunch desert guides Wild Bunch for a reason you are a wild one Laura aren't you yes you like to have fun I knew that from the second I met you you have big energy and if anyone was going to take me out on the trails for a Bing or biking Adventure it would be you how did you how did you end up in this business well I moved to Arizona in 2012 and I've always had that personality to take people out and do things always a leader personality and somebody recommended to me you should be a guide you'd be really good at it and so I took my chances and I worked for Arizona Outback adventures and I became a guide and I absolutely loved it I found so much joy and just it's it's pure it's fun it's you get to be the person that takes the picture with the sarro cactus and get those people out on the trail in a safe way and really show them a sonor and desert experience and well we went out together we did for one of my local loves uh mountain biking one of the uh few things that I think I'd be doing is mountain biking I love biking as a kid just riding around the neighborhood I remember uh the wind therapy of being on a bicycle and then to be out in the desert like that you did a great job of taking care of me making sure I felt at ease making sure I felt safe and um uh cared for in in trying something new so how do you learn that nurturing quality there well that's one thing that's really hard um to learn as a guide is people are not just following you on a bike you're responsible for their safety and to get them back to their Resort so they can get that drink with an umbrella so it just kind of comes with time and just sort of understanding and learning people's nuances and and their fears and making them do something that they're scared of so we really really watch for that type of stuff and take care of people yeah from from the nervous energy to the excitement that they did it to uh that big picture with the Soro Cactus like you said and and trying something new is really special uh tell me a little bit about where you're from how you got to here and how you ended up I mean if someone just said you should be a guide and you took that advice uh tell me how that story I think there's some holes in that story so catch me up a little bit well I'm I mean I have an athletic background um I come I was a three sport athlete in high school and once I went to college I played softball and then what were the three Sports oh volleyball basketball softball oh I went to college played softball after my college career I wanted to work on my physique a little bit and so I took up running and ran I've run 30 marathons done some cycling I have an Iron Man finished a couple Leadville 100s but I really came to Arizona and I got on the mountain bike and I really found my joy there a lot of it is because it's you against nature you're not dealing with cars you're not dealing with um craziness like that but you're dealing with uh the rocks and just the cactus and and the beauty so uh mountain biking has become my joy and my love and I ride a single speed which is a whole another game what does that mean it's a one gear and you know you it's a certain type of Personality that rides single tell me more keep going I mean you know it's not when I'm on tour but it's you know personally it's it's a group of people that just choose to ride one gear because it's a difficult and it's you know kind of kind of gives you a little more of a status you know so this might be a type A type thing um possibly probably right right and I ride with the Arizona single Speeders and it's you know it's a fun group of m mostly guys really nice professionals that are out there riding their bikes having fun so you have to be kind of a a guy girl so to speak you know so when you came to Arizona what were you doing for work uh prior to Arizona I was a massage therapist for about 14 years um I'm from the Quad Cities Davenport Iowa um and then I came to Arizona and just switched it up really that's it yeah so you became a guide the second you moved here well I worked uh for tri Sports in Tempe and then they decided to go on another journey and that's when my friend Randy reached out to me and said oh you'd be a great guide and sent me the uh the ad for Arizona alac adventures and then you work for them for how long oh I was there for about four years what inspired you to go out on your own and build your own business your own brand really it was about wanting to do something more private and having more connection with our guests um Arizona Outback Adventures at the time and to this day um they're now REI Adventure Center they're really known for their Logistics in terms of bigger groups and they pull it off lovely and wonderfully but we wanted to do something more small and private and boutique and wow factors and give people that fun safe Adventure but know their name and be able to have them come back year after year and my my staff and I know them by name and there just just just a little bit different in terms of group size you know keeping it small and private so 2016 is when you started your business uh who was your very first booking and what was that like oh wow uh it was her name was Kristen and at the time we were doing uh Camelback Mountain hikes oh wow oh that's tough which Carell did you take people on both well so we took it was it was interesting she called she actually called a bike shop and my my friend Crystal who owns spur cross Cycles she recommended me as a guide cuz in the beginning it was just me I was taking everybody right so I took her two kids who were at the time like 14 and 16 and the mom we went mountain biking and then they went and climbed Camel Back Mountain with one of my guides and to this day they still every time they're in Arizona call and we do something no how special yeah it is special yeah and um you know you sent me some notes uh tell me about what happened in 2020 where you were driving for Amazon what happened there oh well you know hiking and biking it was a Gray Line it was deemed essential I mean really and our business depends on tourism and there wasn't any tourism happening in Arizona so we decided to I rented some of my bikes out to people that had stayed in Arizona and I came came across um gentleman named Mark Nelson who had a Amazon uh DPS so Amazon drivers are independent contractors and he it was weird how we connected because he worked kind of in my industry when he worked for Toyota so he kind of understood that I had a small business and I was going to go back to it if I could and so I took a job as an Amazon driver and I delivered in Chandler um and Sant Valley and um I did that for eight months and I took every single shift I could just to save my business just to make sure that I had money in the bank and I was personally making money to take care of my bills but it was great I was listening to my Freddy Mercury I was delivering toilet paper and cat litter like it was going out of style and people and people Jamie were so great to drivers they were leaving us Gatorade and it was it was an experience for sure so I have a I have a different type of love for Amazon drivers I every time I see them I try to give them two bucks to get a drink on me because save my business I mean really wow that's I mean they're like magic things just appear and you like think of something all of a sudden it appears on your doorstep boom it's there especially during that time and then to help that pad uh your savings and save your businesses really so Wild Bunch why did you go with the name Wild Bunch because it I feel like there's a little bit of a tombstone you know reference there Wild Bunch and then just the wild west and it describes sort of the personality not in terms of crazy wild but just eccentric and fun and happy I mean I think when I first met you and your crew it was big smiles big hugs big hellos uh big energy and you love that especially when you're about to go out and do something new head out to the desert uh you don't know what's going to happen out there I trust that you do yeah and uh and I like that name though too thank you and you know you mentioned Tombstone uh so you have a trip that is going to be in Jerome soon for fun yes we're going to Jerome this evening um for the celebration of Halloween and we're going we're staying at the clink scale have you been there yes yes yes okay uh so you know we tap this podcast in advance we record a podcast I suppose and when you talk about timely things we're going to be dropping this in November but I couldn't help but ask because I love Arizona and I love getting around Arizona so uh so this is Halloween that we are taping uh and yes so you're going down to the clink scale where they say they have a haunted cat a little ghost cat who hops on your bed at the clink scale and I swear I felt that cat hop up on my bed really one night when I stayed there oh that's so cool like a little pet energy like you know how you feel like the bed kind of go down a little really I I swear it happened to me it probably maybe it was just put in my head and you know I like animals okay I was that idea didn't scare me I think the name's cat is um the name of the cat is sip like sipping milk I think so that's my clink scale story but it's a beautiful hotel I made this reservation back in March um and I was really excited did cuz we've stayed at the Jerome Grand on Halloween night and oh that was you that's something you have to do on your bucket list as a matter of fact we have reservations there next year again I got on their waiting list and they've already they're already booking for um years ahead it's that is an experience for sure it's it's what it's legit it's scary and the place still smells like the days of the miners in the Asylum and it's freaky so you think it's haunted I think it's haunted I do think it's haunted yeah okay so we got the Halloween energy out of us let's talk about going biking uh going hiking because now we're in mid November it's time to play in the valley and it's like Prime weather Prime season finally what can we do how do we do it safely so we a lot of our a lot of our clients are guests you know they come into town they're coming to Arizona for the first time bringing their kids so we are really respected in terms of taking kids and families that's sort of our Target is couples kids families small groups small Bachelor Bachelor at parties but don't go party the night before you come out with us that's that bad idea yeah that could be that could be a little dangerous but um so just reach out uh we our website definitely is the best way to look at everything and understand I answer the phone so if you call you're going to get me for sure and of course I'm always willing to take time to talk you through any of the activities we do we can we can tailor it to any level from a touring Pace to a moderate to an advanced there's all kinds of options here Jamie yeah you got to come explore well you have to explore because our city and our state is just so incredibly beautiful and I think it's something that I think oh I'd love to do that but I need a professional with me I've been that person who took that hike and got I rescued by the the angel who had the water or the kleenex or whatever in the mountain SI struggling uh because you just don't realize uh how strenuous some of this stuff is and we think ah I'm used to the Heat come on but it'll sneak up on you uh and so if I had a small group and I wanted to take a hike uh with you are you doing Camelback do you have other Mountain options How does it go so we try our best to make the hike location is close to where the guests are staying so we don't do Camel Back Mountain anymore um we leave that to other companies who really sincerely find joy in summitting Camelback every day and there are companies out there that do that um we so you would you'd call and you'd book and we' take you say most of our hikes are in the Phoenix Mountain Preserve Area Trail 302 is a big one we use we started going out of Dreamy Draw that trail head there is wonderful have you seen the new renovated trail head at Dreamy Draw well we talked about it on the news but I haven't seen it it's it's gorgeous it's beautiful we do some hikes up at um Tom sum area Marcus Landslide um our guest that come from the Four Seasons we stay up north in North Scottsdale Gateway Trail head in the mcdal Sor and preserve all those areas are just beautiful the trail heads lots of people are really stunned by the beauty of those rustic Immaculate Trail heads and and they love the bathrooms they're so nice oh that's important yes it is and Less Traveled is nice too a few times I I will only do camel back when um Santa Camelback Santa is up there right that is no that is I will go honestly I think camel back is a great hike it's super challenging as you know both sides but when they have Camel Back Santa up there he is so great because of his charity driven um organization and then just the candy canes when he's got the he gives you the heart or the coal I always get a piece of coal from him I don't know I don't know you know him well what does he know about you I don't know that's what I'm wondering I'm like he's got a be in his Bonnet over something I look at him I'm like how does why is he handing me Cole like me like out of all the people up here me and just to tease you yeah I know so do you know him personally I don't know him personally I follow him on Instagram do you follow him um I I did a couple stories with him oh you did is he a great guy I don't think I ever interviewed him I think I set him up for other reporters but I did one year end up on his Christmas card list so I got a Christmas card here to the station from Camelback Santa and that thing hung in my cubicle as long as we had cubicles now we're in pods so a lot of my Decor came down but I couldn't believe it it was like he's a local celebrity Legend he's like a goat he's a goat he did I know he did I think he did um and I hope he's I hope I get this right I think he did the Appalachian TR or he did one of those big through hikes too yeah amazing and can you imagine hiking that tree up there I want to know I think I've seen the people it's like there are these elves that come out of nowhere and then all of a sudden there's a tree up there and boom and then there's the one one time there was the Grinch I mean I've seen the Grinch up there the who's the hooville people they really they call out Camel Back Mountain this is why I do camel back in at Christmas time only uh tell me about you you've helped people get on the bike learn how to M mountain bike and then really uh go on to do big things with the bike tell me about that so some of um my personal proudest moments as a guide and I I would say my staff would say the same thing is when we get a a child who is five or six or seven and they've never Mountain biked before and you could be you could be the difference in their life in terms of mountain biking you get one shot Jamie you've got to hit the mark like you've got to get them out there you've got to make it fun you've got to make them they can make them feel like they can do it keep them rolling teach them you know small skills like your wheels go where your eyes go just little things and then because they their whole life could love biking right they could be seven love it 10 love it 21 love it 35 love it but I've actually had uh kids that I've taken who were now uh High School Champions and their parents still reach out to me and say our son won the Minnesota high school championship and send me a picture and here I am with a little picture with their son standing next to a cactus or so we can it's our job can be really uh rewarding too in terms of making a difference I tend to cry a little on this podcast and that made me tear up just to know that this experience here in Arizona maybe they're visiting uh maybe it's their first time on the bike in the desert you think of what a pivotal moment on a bike for a kid is the freedom Etc and then to make that big biking is something people can do for life so you think of all these skills that we learn in school that you know when am I going to do that again you know I'm not going to dance on my toes anymore like I used to um but that's something people can do for their entire life and feel secure in it and happy with it so how cool is that that you get to make that difference you know it's it's it's overwhelming and it certainly I'm going to get tery too I hope we don't look like Marilyn Manson but I guess I guess we could on Halloween um I you know I just I wrote a Blog about this recently too just about how guides guiding is more than just like I said earlier get on the bike and follow me I mean you could you could be in the middle of somebody's divorce and don't know it you could be that person out there making someone's entire day and you don't know it they could have you know for example my mom has dementia they could have a a family member with dementia like my mom and they they're dealing with that too and they come out on that ride and they're they're choosing you to make that difference they're choosing your team to take them out and make them smile and we've had some really deep intense moments with with guests and how they feel the first time they see a sarro cactus and their face just lights up and they're standing there looking up at it or you know sometimes we find cactus that have the needles burned off because they're aging right and they can hug them and oh wow it's yeah it's like you know I mean safely you know we get them but I mean my point is is anybody can make a difference and we happen to be in a job that is Rich and giving joy and adventure to people in this in our beautiful state of Arizona how do you even train for that you have to uh be trained to uh make sure everything's safe make sure you train us properly to conduct our vehicle our bike safely and then you have to provide emotional support for whatever crisis you don't know that we're going through and that's why I'm out here in the middle the desert and on bike today right well you um most of my all of my staff is required to be first aid CPR certified in terms of medical uh some of my guides have a Wilderness first responder which is a really great tool in case you're in a situation that is not with a 911 range you can do a little more medically before uh proper you know medical professionals show up on scene but it's you know you you're always you always need to be in shape number one I mean you never know know who you're going to get as a a client so um it's it's a good way to keep in shape but on that note it's not about you it's about your guest it's all about your guest so the miles you put on out there are not your personal miles they're your guest miles and so it's a good way to keep in shape yeah that's for sure mentally and physically I imagine yes so do you have a favorite trail that you ride for joy my favorite Trail on the mountain bike and this is a single speed ride is I love Desert Classic at South Mountain um it's it's fun it's a lot of up and down it's super flowy and it just makes sense on a single speed uh as a hike I love Tom's Thumb I think Tom's Thumb is hands down one of the most beautiful it's got a little element of challenge it's got a uh there's a bowl that you I call call it the bowl you kind of walk into this bowl of Boulders that are just amazing and then you got to touch the thumb for luck and the views of North Scottdale and Pinnacle Peak and four seasons and Browns Ranch are just amazing um from up there so okay so um I like to hike in quotes I really like to walk I don't like to use my hands to climb would you do on Camelback I always let people know like you kind of climb on Camel Back that's correct that's good information T don't know yeah you're using your hands you're scooting on your butt um when you do Tom's Thumb do you climb the thumb no so you just to go touch it you go well that sounds a little better because I always wondered what the heck was going on that hike Tom's Thumb have you ever done it no are we going now we are now okay that's fine with me I mean you didn't on a bike you rocked that mountain bike and let me tell you your photog had that camera and he was riding the bike remember vict is Victor still with you of course he is Victor shout out to Victor always he was amazing yeah he was riding the bike he was shooting at the same time he he had great control he's a Marine by the way yeah so I was enjoyed working yes thank you Victor for your service now then and in the future because he he does a great job so Tom Thum is different from camel back if you want to compare the two in terms of terrain Tom Thum is a little I feel like it's steeper but it's more managable so you're not climbing Boulders as you know my overview of Echo Canyon at camel back is you do a couple of switchbacks and you feel like then you get to the stair Master yes then you have the handrails yes then you have the four bouldering sections okay that's how I break it down yeah that's good that's how I break it down however sometime one time someone told me there was a bar at Kimel Back Mountain and once you reach the bar I go what do you mean the bar they have a bar I thought we were talking about like Jade bar or Sanctuary what are we talking about oh there's a bar that you literally like hoist in your body up I'm sliding I'm inan my old sneakers I had no idea I should probably have bought new like better shoes for this experience right yeah I was sliding up and down that thing but I grabbed that bar and I hoisted myself up and I kept going yeah so to your point of Footwear yes big big you know if you're going to come and Hike here please don't listen who doesn't love a good pair of Chuck tailor I have some Batman ones I adore them but I would not recommend that type of Footwear with that flat bottom like a k or a Vans not not the best choice now if you fly here and you put in your suitcase okay it's close to toad so that's good but I would say get a good hiking boot go to Just ruing it local was on your local love yes and my podcast yes go you know go local shop local um or wear you can wear a Hoka or I'm just going to you know any one of those names yeah Hoka something like that is better than that pink Converse okay you know so we described the terrain at Echo but what about Tom's Thumb so what is the terrain like there Tom's Thumb is more um PE gravel um easier to manage like U more beautifully cut Trails um it gets steep in the beginning and it's a little bit loose so when coming down you have to really watch your footing and you kind of have to do like a sideways walk down just to hold your balance not slip yeah is it intermediate is it beginner it's ranked intermediate uh a little bit Advanced I think it's because of the major elevation gain right off the bat I mean you you start out and you're like oh this is beautiful and you're looking at these beautiful rocks and then all of a sudden bam elevation yeah so got to be ready yes stay ready do that's what we say you and I I mean why not we do I do okay so we're going to do that okay um it's a date yes we we'll make that work um the first oh Tommy says we have to finish the podcast first Tommy just for that comment you're coming with us so he's in he's in great technician he loves to ride so you get this guy in a motorcycle he will ride he likes the wind therapy too so maybe we need to try him on a mountain bike o I think he would love that yes and Jamie can Mountain Bike Tommy by the way I'll try I was there I was there I mean I I was there I think um in this in this business I've learned I can do anything for three minutes and I just tell myself when I'm scared I could do it for three minutes and if I continue to like it I can stop I can continue and if I don't I don't have to do it again which is a lovely I think just try it right for three minutes the segment the new segment is three minutes but I had so much fun out there and you make it um a destination so you do a little journey tell me if we're going to do um a mountain biking uh experience what happens on our day how long is the day what time do we start how does that work so our most popular mountain bike experience is about 2 hours we have our guests meet up at The mcdor Preserve in North Scottdale you went out of phfi trail head but now we are at Puma Dynamite trail head there's multiple start locations so they would show up um one of my guides would be there with the bikes we'd get the Heights from the guests prior to mountain bikes we provide helmets uh all of our helmets are turned once a year so we make sure that our equipment is up to date up to par we provide uh full finger mountain bike gloves because you go down maybe possibly um you put your hand down first I want you to be able to swim at that pool later and not have that you know that hand that's rash yes so we have full finger gloves we um offer backpacks for our guests to borrow water snacks and a couple other fun little things that we take out there treats along the way little wild factors yeah for the Wild Bunch for the Wild Bunch and we you know we uh we talk to our guests I talk to them my guides talk to them about food allergies to make sure someone has a gluten allergy we have the correct snacks out there someone has um is kosher we can we can provide snacks for that too so yeah we we plan it all we bring it all but we bring it all right wear a nice shoe hopefully yeah close toad shoe is it's important um Athletic Apparel always sunscreen always recommended drink water don't be hung over yes don't please it's so warm out sometimes yeah if you if you're coming with a group of friends and you plan on hitting Oldtown the night before you know I always say Moscow Mule water Moscow Mule water just don't show up dehydrated if you can cuz it's not that's not a fun thing for anybody tell me what you've learned about running a business oh it's it's fun but it can be difficult uh I think people like me who are entrepreneurs go into this and go oh I can do what I love and make lots of money but the reality is is I can do what I love and give people lot of Adventures and be comfortable and there's days you know doing permits is hard doing insurance is hard managing staff is hard even though they're all independent contractors you know they have lives and and scheduling and other jobs and but I think at the end of the day there's nothing I'd really rather be doing although I have sat on the side of the 101 and turned on My Radio Gaga by Queen when I'm having a bad day or am I Whitney Houston I want to dance with somebody cuz I'm just in tears cuz it some days it's hard why what what made you cry I think it's cuz I'm an emotional business owner and that's something I need to work on but just just when things kind of go sideways or you know we might get out bid for a tour someone calls me and our pricing is a little high and they call one of our competitors and they they go with them but I know they should have went with us but I don't want to give in cuz I don't want to devalue my company and I don't know there's just there's just days where it's hard it's hard to manage and let me tell you good Freddy Mercury or Whitney Houston can really pull you right out of that it's amazing about music yes yeah absolutely on this on this podcast I like to ask about the jump and making that jump from working from someone else for someone else into uh self-employment what would you tell yourself before you made that move what would you tell someone else who's thinking about making that move working for someone else can be amazing if if the person that you're working for is someone that you love and I would say adore um I think the biggest differences is you have time for yourself but you think you do but you don't um it's a 247 running your own business is 24/7 really at the end of the day and it's hard to set hours to stay in for example I'm going to answer my phone from 8 to 8 that never happens I can assure you tonight Brett and I will be sitting probably in the uh spirit room and my business phone will ring and I'll have to make a decision whether to take it or not right so when you work for somebody else I feel like you're you're in a schedule and you go to you you show up you do your job and you go home right right but when you're a business owner it's it's Non-Stop and you have to you have to get used to that yeah and the the people that you choose to be in your tribe to support you also have to get used to get used to that so you're going to take that call that's right yep in the next 20 minutes Brett sitting alone in the spirit room while you book something that's right good thing he likes IPA uh what are you loving in Phoenix right now what are you loving in Arizona what are you reading what are you eating what are you doing oh well I mean obviously I have my world series hat on I went to the game one in Arizona last night that was my first time at a World Series game in the energy at Chase Field until about the seventh inning was off the charts you could just feel it through the crowd until we couldn't score some runs um so uh I you know I'm a I'm a dive bar girl I love to go to like Coach House in Oldtown Scottdale or rusty spur or The Dubliners really close to where we live so um I'm not a foodie so I'm not out you know uh eating eating at a high-end restaurant I mean Coach House that in rusty spur those are aren't those the two debatable oldest bars in Scottdale there's like a we just don't know which one came first yeah well and the and the coach house has all their Christmas lights up they are and you know that's amazing when you're sitting there you're like how I mean between them and the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess I'm not sure like I mean are the same P there you go right it is and and the spur always has live music and for being someone who's worked random schedules like you probably would have worked random schedules in your life um 2 o'clock on a Tuesday I can count on 2m on a Tuesday that the spur would have live music so it is nice to have those little um places that we enjoy and have been around for 100 years yeah and you can right and does that cowboy on the horse still roll in there oh I hear he's retiring but I think he's got one like this is his last season is what I've heard word on main stream and you can sit in those those butt chairs yep so you can look like you have a saloon girls backside yeah I mean I do love the spur and I do love he's the singing Cowboy that's it he sings um tell me about how people would make reservations if they're interested and uh how we find out what to do and how would I even know what I should do we talked about Tom's Thumb but if I were going with some friends or if I we're going with maybe uh Grandma and Grandpa what what are some things that we should be thinking about about as far as the hike as far as the bike as far as um how difficult something might be so you would either if you're at a resort we the concierge teams use us quite a bit so you'd call you know have a concierge call and then next step would be we would book you um we would book you for a hike and then our guide the guide that I assign will call you directly and ask you some questions you know what are you looking for what is your expectation um how many people you know what's the level of everybody in the group so we do that sort of vetting process so we have a better idea and then we have a couple different places we take people we're not just one Trail only um The mcdal snor Preserve has 280 miles of trails in North Scottdale alone and then South Mountain has a bunch of trails so we would do that and we'd get you all set we' uh have a guide the guide meet you or we do transportation in some situations some pickups U guide would meet you have all the supplies and off you go and it's you know managing a different levels of people that happens quite a bit okay so so we don't have to worry about that that you will worry about that you'll handle that she'll handle that for us what else do you want everybody to know is there anything else you want the people to know about you guys just come to Arizona if you're you know you're thinking about it or you're on the fence Scottsdale is amazing there's art here there's you know nlife there's the World Series is right now the suns are doing great our Cardinals are doing great I mean we are just sportswise we're we're big but and go out on adventures not just with my company there's there's other things you can do if you're not a mountain biker or a hiker there's Jeep companies that are amazing Stellar Adventures is amazing for Hummer tours I mean there's hot air balloon companies that are amazing uh detours does Grand Canyon stuff I mean you can literally come here and book a a a tour every day you're here and see something different from a different angle different perspective but Jamie and I are going to be at Tom's Thumb looking down yeah we will we sure are we we'll we'll post it on the gram when we do we will and and and also even if you're a local you can do all these things and one of my

{"doc_id": "0peKmdBn", "video_title": "Jesse Watters: If you're conservative, it's dangerous to protest", "video_description": "'The Five' co-hosts react to pro-Palestinian protests raging across the United States. #foxnews #fox #thefive Subscribe to Fox ...", "video_transcript": "another weekend of chaos with anti-israel protesters flooding the streets over a thousand people marching in Manhattan with one agitator getting cheered on while tearing down an American flag others facing off with police while smashing on doors outside of Grand Central Station in Delaware a group marching outside Biden's home demanding a ceasefire and accusing him of supporting genocide let's go to Austin Texas a group of protesters on horse back waving Palestinian Flags while taking over the streets vice president KLA Harris asked to condemn what we've been seeing instead she said this people have a right to protest we are a democracy and we should value the voices and listen to the voices what I hope is that we can engage in conversation and discourse in a way that understands this is not binary not to mention what it means in our own country in terms of longstanding issues with anti-Semitism which has been on the rise and even before before this happened um islamophobia and and other forms of hate against people just simply based on who they are or how they pray it's a lot of words so she's not the only Democrat raising eyebrows liberal Bill Maher berading Barack Obama over the former president's moral equivalency between Israel and Hamas I must say I I am struggling with people's moral equivalency still I mean Barack Obama who has rarely disappointed me did so this week the attack was only a month ago a more Savage attack than we've ever seen in Reverse there's a big difference between collateral damage and what Hamas did when they fire at Israel it's a war when Israel fires back it's a war crime little crazy so and also would Hamas do that would they give four hour pause no no pausing Jesse is there a little bit of daylight between KLA Harris and Biden because Biden has been pretty stalwart in saying Israel needs has the right to defend himself and I'm just wondering if there was a little bit of KLA Harris saying we got to see both sides here that might be by design that daylight because they're trying to straddle supporting Israel and managing the protest movement so it doesn't hurt them in the election but I'm with Greg I might just convert to woke to be able to protest because if you're a conservative and you go to a school board meeting and raise a Ruckus cuz some transgender kid raped your daughter in a bathroom and the school covered it up or maybe you were a tea party protester who didn't like the Wall Street bailouts or perhaps you wanted to support election Integrity or maybe you held a sign at Michigan State House and said we'd like to go back to work now Governor if you do that you get audited you get arrested you get smeared you probably get put on a no fly list maybe the Southern Poverty Law Center cancels your life but you're saying if you have a massive movement all over the country for a month where you're desecrating monuments vandalizing the White House it's now deadly you murdered a Jewish guy in Los Angeles everyone just wants to be cautious let's just give him room to breathe let's not do anything you don't get the full weight of the federal government the military industrial complex the Democrat media industrial complex reigning down on your movement you don't get that and that's not right and that's not fair and at this point the American people if you're conservative it's it's almost dangerous to get out on the street and protest but it's not dangerous to get out in the street and Hoist the Palestinian flag and tear down the American flag there's like no arrests right and Greg where is the White House urgency about American hostages nowhere I'm still TR look man I'm still trying to make heads or Tales of what KLA just said so she said not binary or non-binary uh in applying to this she might be right in that there's only one way one way to look at what happened there isn't two ways so maybe that's not nonbinary it could one binary if it's non-binary you could say one One Direction is non-binary because the people that say there are both sides are relying on a historical narrative to justify present day atrocity it's only about October 7th we don't care about anything before because that thing is the worst thing we've seen since 911 maybe if you look at the pictures it might be worse so it's a mental state versus the Jewish State and the only way these anti-sat can Embrace a truly immoral repulsive Act is by Conjuring up a context to justify or erase or deny Terror know Bill Mah is like a load star for the central liberal Centrist liberal you know when your party blinks before a contingent that uses the word but after saying Hamas behe beheaded babies yeah yeah but you need to run screaming from that party uh you cannot March metaphoric Al or Liberal Liberal uh literally alongside genocidal deniers uh it this is not part of the big picture the only picture is from October 7th it goes back to this thing you have a delusional generation of young people out there so you have to examine how we lost these people what happened what happened so what used to education used to be a social issue but now it's a security issue you should start worrying a little bit what are they telling them right there's anti-west propaganda now being taught in schools and maybe it's time to rethink how we look at education it's not a social thing anymore it's a security thing this is now about the future of our country what do we do judge the Jewish people are 2.6% of the US population yet suffer 60% of hate crimes there hate crimes against Jewish Americans are up 400% since October 7th and the response from the White House was a national strategy on islamophobia yeah yeah uh the amazing part of it is that and I think that Jesse is right I think that this Administration is trying to straddle both issues and I don't understand it because I think I mentioned last week that the Arab American vote Nationwide is like 1% so um you know this whole idea that you know we have to you know maybe we need a two-state solution and with commala says uh I hope we can have a conversation and discourse um you know none of these people who are Marching and prot testing want a conversation and discourse when they start you know chanting settlers go back home Palestine is ours alone that's not a conversation that's not a two-state solution or we don't want a Jewish State we just want back 48 which is when Israel became a nation state and from The River To The Sea I mean everybody knows that's for the elimination of Israel and you know the statement that someone made when they attack Israel it's War but when Israel defends her self pursuant to the laws of war it's a war crime and this is something that has repeated itself throughout history and now America is stuck with a group of people not just a group of people an incredible um uh chaos a mob of people who were standing up for Palestine when Palestine was given the ability to take over the Gaza and they elected Hamas and this is one of the consequences and Israel waited weeks before they started the assault to let them get out but I think that that that using a transgender term Greg I didn't understand it either when she said nonbinary nonbinary you know the truth is we've got American hostages over there we're in the middle of a war you take a side in a war you can't strad Jessica tomorrow there is a anti-Semitism March in DC pro-israel March in Washington DC I expect it's going to get a large turnout turnout enounter imagine if Biden or KLA Harris actually went to that wow I think it would be great I have a lot of friends that are going prob not happening well I don't think that that's fair I mean as you said in your opener asking if there's daylight between Biden and KL on this I I happen to think that both of them have been very very clear about where the US stands on this um Joe Biden has been more pro-israel than Israelis expected more than BB Netanyahu expected more than other world leaders who have followed him in to this saying you unequivocally get our support for everything that you need um I'd love it if they showed up I don't know if that's on the docket um but either way I expect um a wonderful turn out there as it should be but what kamla Harris is talking about and she said not binary first of all in terms of this isn't a black and white issue everyone who is marching with the Palestinian flag or with these people is not necessarily pramas some of them are actually out there saying we need to free Palestine I have issues with the occupation what goes on or what they perceive as the occupation in the West Bank now do I think it's the right time for that absolutely not because this is all about as Greg said what happened on October 7th there was a ceasefire that day and it was violated by one group of terrorists that did this but 388 per spike in anti-semitic hate crimes 182% spike in islamophobic hate crimes that is also existing within our borders she is the vice president for all Americans and I don't I get that people want to score political points about it but I don't know how people who are supportive of Israel and want to make sure that they can do whatever they need to to root out Hamas and to avenge the deaths the 1400 deaths and get those hostages back could complain about this Administration and politics is a binary choice and we saw that on Election night right that there were Democrats and Republicans on the ballot and people picked Democrats and I'm listening to the front runner on the other side talk and Donald Trump is not only it's seven times he's now confused Biden and Obama which should put him in the uh mental acuity ouse there right that he can't find his pants at least like Biden but this is what the man tweets out what is this because you're talking about the leadership that we're seeing and then we're talking about KLA and Joe she's the right and I'm saying that all of this for people is contextualized in light of Elections and what is on the other side of this matters to people that's how there are lots of Jew right who can't make a decision I I I don't when I see those marches I don't see what you see and I'm surpris you look at it this way because those people don't like you I have I have I wavered one bit ever that's not a political that's not a political statement coming from I'm not saying oh you got to do this I I don't I'm not talking about Biden and I'm not talking about Trump I'm talking about something bigger that is happening in this country that puts your life at risk I understand that and I certainly deeply feel that but this segment is about kamla Harris who is an elected official and who said that I mean but one of the things I wanted to point out is that there is a big March tomorrow for anti-Semitism and it's going to be great it's going to

Ukrainian city of Mariupol nearly two years ago, in February of 2022, a group of ...", "video_transcript": "Ukraine's war against Russia is heading into its second winter and president vadir zalinski is warning ukrainians to brace for more attacks on National infrastructure this as Russian forces ramp up attacks on key cities in eastern Ukraine for the Ukrainian people it has been a long 21 months since this War began a new Frontline documentary takes a look at the very beginning in the southern city of mar upal where Russia began its invasion someone once told me Wars don't start with explosions they start with [Music] silence Russians have entered the city the war has begun and we have to tell its story 20 days in marup follow AP Ukrainian journalists trapped in the besieged city documenting the horrors that they witnessed there I'm joined Now by front lines executive producer and editor-in chief Rainey Arison wrath and the film's producer and editor Michelle Meisner thank you so much for being with us to both of you I screened you know the preview for The Press over the weekend it is just some powerful documentary work here uh and leaves you haunted uh Michelle I I'd love to to start with you uh it had you know th this experience that the story lines that tie together the the connections that are being formed right as this all was happening in the very beginning is just really extraordinary talk to me about putting together this piece of this story that we probably will hear for years to come sure um so the way that Frontline became involved with this film is at the very beginning of the invasion Rainey who's here uh was watching the footage coming in um from mislav chernov who is an Associated Press journalist who is Ukrainian and has been covering this war for the past 10 years and he knew that Mary ubil was going to be a place that um the The Siege would be that there would there would be a lot of um of conflict and so he went there with a team team uh and they covered the first days and that's when we saw the hospital bombing um and we all remember the Maternity Ward um the images of the victims and Rainey saw those images as well and she thought this looks like it could be a film Frontline has a standing relationship with the Associated Press and so she reached out to them and started discussing um like who made these who made these images um who was behind the camera and that's how we were connected with mlav chv who's the director of the film Rainey talk to me about seeing these images and then putting them together in a in a story that folks can really understand what's happening there because so many of the people in this piece say here roll the cameras I'm glad that you're here tell our story right I mean that was remarkable right that so many people wanted their story to be told and yet there was a tension with the filmmaker and the and the reporters on the ground too um but yeah no we were seeing as said we were seeing these images I thought there was something really extraordinary coming out of Mar uple in terms of just the composition and the way the stories were being told the footage was really remarkable we were all responding to it and so that was the first idea was maybe there was a documentary here and Michelle was really the person I had in mind to collaborate with M sherov because Michelle is an amazing editor as you can see I mean really the magic happens in the edit room between the editor producer and the director and that collaboration is the key to the best films that we have um you know and this is what happened is Michelle and mislav hit it off very well and spent months together collaborating and of course I was involved too but it's really about looking at what are the most seminal stories that we should be telling in a situation like this we we thought you know Mary upole would have staying power we think it does we think it's important for it to be in the world today and it's it's really documenting something they were the only reporters on the ground so it's really really unique and and and it's extraordinary the kind of access they had absolutely um I want to go ahead and pull in uh a clip from the bombing of a maternity hospital and the images here we want to warn everyone uh could be disturbing for some viewers but we do want to roll some of that tape [Music] for [Music]  now we also know that we follow that story line through the the documentary and like so many chilling stories that are are are told here and continue to be told and happen on the ground not just stories but they're happening to folks that it has a sad outcome um when putting together some of these pieces of video because when it's war time there's so much to cover right there's so much to sift through Michelle I'm I'm thoughtful of how do you choose which connections to to make for folks uh especially when it's the beginning of this conflict and you don't necessar know where things are going to go yeah that was the incredible part of working on this project because he didn't necessarily know he was um filming for ultimately a documentary while he was there he started having an idea that this this footage was so important because it was going to document um a city that was essentially leveled in a matter of days um and the people there and what happened to them and it would be a part of History so he kept recording and he brought it back and we looked at the footage and talked about what was a unifying um way to explore and and tell these stories um and we ended up finding that he was a good person to help us navigate this really difficult space but also he was somebody because he was somebody from the Ukrainian Community but he's also a journalist and they um uh asked him to keep filming there's a really incredible moment where a doctor in the middle of a very intense um uh moment ple begs him please come in keep filming it's good the Press is there and so he kept filming absolutely and and you see that as a recurring theme like we mentioned you know there's a police officer a few moments after we see that video there's a police officer that wants who says interview me ask me questions and then wants to do it again in English uh and I I think about the urgency um that is being felt there to get the story out um rainy did you feel that uh when seeing the video helping to put it together well I mean you certainly felt that everyone who they were filming with were in such distress that they had no one to turn to I mean you see this at all juncture points right the fire police everyone's gone like they're very much alone they're isolated and they're barricaded in right so they also don't have the outside world so remember all of that is very isolating for them so I think the idea that they could tell someone their story even to make sure that their loved ones on the outside knew they were okay was really powerful and Michelle started to talk to me about the sort of inside outside feeling of the film you know you're very much inside Mary youup but the technique of actually then going out with the news right like having a moment to see these moments these news stories were making it into the larger world and having an impact really helped you right through the documentary because you realize they weren't all alone in the sense that these stories were getting out and that's really a testament to M slob as you see in the film finding the only signal he could find to get the news out and so there was a feeling of urgency for sure um we also have another piece of tape which and we're talking about that inside outside feeling documenting what is happening there in real time and then making sure that people hear these stories right uh this is from the uh AP journalist they're seeing Russia invade this is the first time I saw Z the Russian sign of [Music] war the hospital is surrounded dozens of doctors hundreds of patients and us incredible account there uh being on the ground as this was happening I think what and you all both have really uh nailed this home is that the journalist is living this with the people that he is documenting while this is happening in real time um and you know this doesn't give too much away but we know that he has a family and then he also reflects and I think that that's so important because as journalists we don't always reflect in real time time as we are doing this documenting of of what's happening so I think that's a powerful piece of this movie wouldn't you say uh Michelle yeah I I think mlav was really interested in making sure that the film was not about him uh but he was also willing to be the person who we could be alongside as we were taking in these events and he felt so committed to making sure that something that things that are potential war crimes were shared not only documented and um shared in the news clips that he was sending out in real time but also that they would be a part of history and it's a conflict that's ongoing it's a war that's ongoing Mary upul is a city that people still live in um people are um it's under Russian occupation now and so the story goes on and the those who have been displaced are living in other parts of Ukraine all over the world um they've seen this film and they have felt and miss laava and the team vasilisa stepanenko and Jenny maleta the other journalists that were with mov in marup they've been able to watch the film with people from marup and they have felt like it has been a cathartic experience almost to feel like their story is being told their story is being seen and so it's so meaningful to be able to now share it on PBS and with Frontline um when it airs in uh in just a few in a week here November 21st yeah I'm also thoughtful of this is coming out at a time where there's another uh conflict in in Gaza in that area there in the area of the Gaza Strip and some of these images look very similar to folks who are at home and and these are very different conflicts but um does it make when now that this is coming out and the timing of when it comes out do you think that it gives the audience um are like that boost to think more about this sometimes these conflicts go and come in terms of the Ze eyes of what people are thinking about but it reminds them that this is also still happening and I rain I'll ask you that I mean the the the war and conflict in Ukraine is ongoing what we've seen this whole year starting at sundown is that audiences have been responding to this The Singularity of marup pole as a moment people have been ex really expressing like gratitude that we documented it and made a documentary of it and documentaries are to come of the current Conflict for sure so I think the more that we can do original Fair journalism that documents what's actually happening with context the better we'll all be you know and I really do underscore context here you know you got a lot of context from the journalists on the ground he tells the story of the multiple years that came before The Marry You Pull incident right and that and that's really important to Mrs laav is that there was always context when you know he was telling the story absolutely it's an important film and certainly one that will stay with you Michelle Rainey

{"doc_id": "0peKqfxN", "video_title": "Bears-Lions preview with Dave Wannstedt", "video_description": "On this episode of Football Night in Chicago, Laurence Holmes is joined by Dave Wannstedt to discuss the latest news ...", "video_transcript": "we welcome in our Coach Dave wad coach did you have an enjoyable weekend of watching football I I did uh six games in the NFL yesterday no wait six out of what 12 or 13 that were determined in the last 10 seconds at a game that is uh that's almost stressful for me there were 10 games this weekend if you include the Bears that were on score games wow it's it's pretty incredible I want to talk about this game that's coming up though because I want to get your thoughts on the NFC North let's talk about the Lions when Dan Campbell got the job there were a lot of people who were concerned like wow can he keep this energy the whole time that he's the coach of the Lions he seemed to really turn the culture over there when you watch them what do you see well he he has and you know I remember when he took over as the head coach of the Dolphins I was doing a radio show at Miami at the time and uh it just wasn't a fit you know I don't know if it was the uh the you know the mentality in Miami compared to Detroit or you know he wanted to be physical and run the ball and they were a little bit more throw it you know that type of scheme but this is perfect for him I mean you know Detroit and and he's been able to get players that fit that mold through free agency and the draft and uh they're playing at a high level so the assistant coaches are doing a great job in my opinion of developing these guys I mean I said we you and I talked after the draft last year Lawrence and I thought that Detroit arguably could have had the best draft of anybody in the NFL when you think about it their first two rers Jack Campbell I love him uh vaness a pass rusher uh Brian Branch steal the draft the safety you know that they got out of Alabama he's one of their key guys on defense uh the tight end the tight end leaport from Iowa who's a who is winning games for him Gibb and then Gibbs the top guys so I mean there I don't you know just just saying it out lot again I don't know if there's anybody that that has as good a young players that are contributing and that's the key how about the fact that Jared G when they made that trade to to send Stafford to La it felt like maybe jarro goff's like days of being a a number one quarterback were numbered and he is flourished into Detroit why do you think that is well you know because when they went to the Super Bowl they were a heavy Run play action team and and helped me here because the slip the running back that was at Georgia that was at then went to the Todd Gurley Todd Gurley was one of the top backs in the NFL that year if you remember that year and they were about 55 60% R almost like Detroit and that was his that was his deal that's what what he did best and then after after that something happened with Gurley he got hurt and and they kind of started moving to a little bit more of the dropback stuff and the philosophy change happened and and and it just didn't fit him so I think he's in a perfect fit surrounded by coaches that are really good and uh you know it's he's caught fire now he's caught fire he's doing well he's looking and I mean he I don't even think he's 30 years old yet I think he's 29 like think about that like it feels like he's had a long full career but he's still a young man and he could be their quarterback going forward they like to do a little bit of everything with their offense lot of run and a lot of play action off the run now you just turned 29 how about that uh so they have an offense that's got a lot of different utilities to it they can do deep stuff with Amon ra St Brown yep leapor has been fantastic as a tight end I'm going to get to him in a minute and then they have a good tandem of running backs and know David Montgomery pretty well from his days of playing with the Bears I think they found like a good partner with him and Gibbs like that's a good little thunder and lightning tandem that they got going on I tell you what you mentioned David Montgomery I wouldn't want to be trying to tackle him uh on Sunday when he played the Bears because you know he's a hard Runner and you know in Detroit there's going to be a little bit of extra motivation right I mean so uh he'll be ready to play and last week was he was hurt for a couple weeks he came back back last week had the big game so uh so he'll be flying high right now absolutely he will let's take a look at their defensive rushing stats for the Bears because that that is something to keep in mind too if you take a look at where the Bears are is this defense getting better and has has Matt I flu kind of turned the corner a little bit and getting these guys in the right spot absolutely I mean that is outstanding right there I mean you're talking about I mean it it's from being last or one of the worst in the league to one of the best of the best in the league uh and basically a top 10 defense in most categories and you know when I was up here at training camp this summer I was talking to Matt and we were talking about you know you only have so many draft picks this isn't like college where you can go out and sign 25 recruits right so you only have so many picks and the most important thing to him was which is 100% correct him and Ryan P said hey we we got to we got to stop the run first and then we'll work our way to the pass rushers and that's exactly what they've done I mean they since since he started calling the defenses they have improved and uh you know now you look across the board it's third Down's getting better red Zone's getting better in addition to stopping the Run TJ Edwards is one of the leading tacklers in the NFL I think that he's played really solidly throughout the year I am a little concerned if he gets matched up with Le Florida I feel like that's an advantage for Detroit what would be some of the coaching things that you'd want to tell TJ Edwards about dealing with a versal tight end like that well TJ Edwards out of Wisconsin the port out of Iowa so he knows about these Iowa tight ends you know and the thing about uh the porter he he is uh you could Flex him out and he can run routes against a strong safety so you made a great point when he gets in line and matched up in tight against a linebacker uh athletically he'd like to think and Detroit probably thinks that he does have a little bit of Advantage because of his quickness and stuff but uh you know you got a rookie okay let's not let's not crown him yet with any any trophies and TJ Edwards this guy's been around and he's played in Super Bowls when he was in Philadelphia so he he knows what to do and I I think that U you know I think he'll be ready for it this will not be easy for the port no no question I kind of like T I love how TJ Edwards is playing and this is another opportunity for him to shine and say hey I'm just not a run stopper I can defend a pass on Friday you and I were having some fun talking about the Joshua dob story it's it's amazing the Joshua dob story continues to be amazing you watched him this weekend what' you think uh yeah the the guy didn't make any mistakes in my made very few mistakes uh we saw his athletic ability showed up this week he had to scramble he runs it in for a touched on uh he he makes for being in the system one week to even know where to throw the ball or if there's a blitz coming you know some of the things that people lose sight of is it's easy okay I got the play I know if I'm going right if I'm going left if I'm throwing at the Jefferson or who I'm thr but all of a sudden a blitz comes and we call it sight of bliss sight checks in other words the blitz is coming from this side it's a sight check I got to see it and I got to make it happen now because there's nobody blocking this guy and and for him to be able to get out there and function and you know people are coming after him you got a new quarterback in a new system blit Blitz him let's come after him and see if he can handle it and so far he has he's played on four different teams in the last calendar year it's pretty amazing Browns the Titans the the Arizona Cardinals and now he's with the Minnesota Vikings the Vikings are in the playoff race coach six and four they've won five in a row yeah they are they're playing with as much confidence uh their defense I mean they've got some good leaders you know Jefferson they got Hunter on defense uh you know they've got some good the safety from Notre Dame I'm think of his name now you know they got some good guys in place that can lead this team and they've been to the playoffs so this is not a team that's not been there before so these guys have all been there they know what it takes and last year what they win 11 games last year I think seven out of 11 were one possession games now they're actually I think a better football team today than what they were a year ago isn't that wild a month ago when the Bears and the Vikings got together we were looking at two teams that were looking like mirror images of each other and now the the Vikings and Kevin oconnell like he deserves some some conversation I'm not saying he should win the award but if this team ends up making the playoffs that's a guy that you should at least consider for Coach of the Year you lose your you're one of the best receivers in the game you lose your quarterback you're still in the playoff Chase that's amazing yeah absolutely and uh yeah uh they're starting to run the ball a little bit now too a little bit better you know that was the thing that was was missing I remember when they played when the Bears played them it was a one-dimensional team they were 26th or 27th in the NFL and running the football so you went into that game saying hey all we got to do is is defend the pass uh not now they're starting to balance things a little better we can't finish this segment without talking about the Packers and the problems that the Packers have had there are times when I watch Jordan love and I go oh I get it I get what what they saw in him and then I'm like I don't know what he's doing this is a a very interesting place for the Packers to be right now where they might be looking for a quarterback at the of the Year too yeah I'd like to sit down and talk to Matt laflor and ask him you know because people lose sight when Aaron Rogers was there his last five years the Green Bay Packers were in the top five in running the football uh Dylan uh Aaron Jones I mean these guys were as balanced as any team around I don't see the running game having an impact and and then when you got a Young quarterback I've always believed that how how does a Young quarterback get confidence by throwing completions and making e easy quick decisions this this guy throws the ball deep more than a by in the NFL he's throwing it you know more times than Patrick Mahomes and and Burrows and these guys I don't get it I mean I really like to talk to Matt laflor and talk about where did the running game go it was there with Aaron Rogers and he's a Hall of Famer now you got a young kid and it's really not happen happening and why are you throw why is he throwing the ball down the field so much I mean those two things and I look at their offense that's what jumps off the screen to me well the hope is that they can't put themselves in a position to jump ahead of where the Bears are with their draft picks whether it's their own or with Carolinas but that has been a rough sledding for the Green Bay Packers this is our coach he watched the tape so you didn't have to we appreciate you coach okay thank you Lord", "aigc_title": "Dave Wannstedt's Preview and Analysis of the Upcoming Bears-Lions

taken to address racial divisions exacerbated by the migrant influx, ...", "video_transcript": "mayor can you please share some specific steps you guys talked about to address the racial divisions that have been you know heated it because of the migrant influx and like is that like knocking on doors is that events is that you know Faith events like what kind of specific steps are you going to take to to heal yeah well what I think the first thing is that we have to we have to tell the entire truth in the entire story because this notion that it's only black people who are concerned about the migrant crisis is not true that's right so some of the the the conversation around this division um there are individuals who want to score political points to sew these negative seeds to get us fighting uh one another but in order for me to have an entire uh commission dedicated to reparations as well as an entire office dedicated to re-entry uh a a a dedicated uh Revenue stream for for for for the unhoused that requires black brown and white votes in fact you know the city council has actually demonstrated that even the things that black folks are concerned about that it turns out that other members of city council agree look the whole impetus behind what's happening at the border is for extremism in this country to plant the these seeds of of negativity to divide our city and so what we are doing as a city is what this city did when they elected me is that we surround ourselves around our values we speak to our values by by passing PID time off by abolishing subminimum wage which of course is going to benefit black and brown people and that we're going to continue to do what we do best and that's organize our communities around the values that make the city of Chicago the greatest city in the world you're here with a number of black pastors and one of the issues that we've seen happen or not happen is black churches stepping up to take in some of these migrants did your discussions today uh include any discussions about black church is stepping up and are you asking pastors to do that part in this situation you know the the beauty of this moment is that I don't have to ask people who are Tethered to a faith that's bigger than a govern government to step up and do right by people there are black leaders that are stepping up and leaning in and supporting uh migrants in this moment there are black pastors who are stepping up and making sure that the dollars that are appropriated for violence prevention that the council was prepared to vote for that you know the whole work around re-entry Reverend Marshall hatch has an entire Village on the west side of Chicago called the ma Alpa project that is dedicated to making sure that individuals who are formally incarcerated get another chance um at at Economic Security but about the migrants may have you had any discussions about can can I'm saying what I'm saying is is that black leaders in this city have always stood up for what is Right are they are they they're doing what they have always done which is leaning in and supporting not just this crisis but every single crisis that this city has had to endure what what we don't ever have to debate is where the black church stands when it comes to Justice in this situation is no different I've answered your question they have I I haven't heard you answer the question whether you which part of my question are you not understanding part of my answer that you're not understanding You' asked them to step up what I'm saying is that they've already done it is what I'm saying they already done it I don't understand where you don't understand that they've already done it can we move on because apparently I've said it repeatedly that let me just I'm clear that black pastors have already stepped up in this moment of course we're having conversations about how the federal government and and the state government has to do more but I wanted to be emphatically clear because if you're not hearing it I want you to hear it clear black pastors are stepping up as they always have stepped up um I I do have a different question but I am going to back up my colleague and saying I think he's just asking how many churches have taken in famili our churches taking fam that's it sure well sir a number of them have stepped up and we're going to continue to push for more of them to step up all right I just but I do have a question on different topic can you talk a little bit about your new your pick as the new health commissioner um why she was chosen and why you believe she will make a better health commissioner than Allison arw well as you know public health is uh is a is an important part of my Administration and as I've said repeatedly our work to to to pass treatment not trauma was an essential part of our my campaign and we've delivered on that promise um opening up mental health uh clinics which were shut down by a couple administrations ago um that we are obviously moving with Expedition um to to make sure that public health um reaches every single neighborhood um Dr eay is is in an incredible human being uh quite frankly she really embies the collaborative competent compassionate Spirit um that I've said from the very beginning that leadership in my Administration has to to IDE and um the vote and the confidence that she has um from Community leaders as well as key stakeholders that understand that public health um has to be um you know a system of care that she represents the values in which the people of Chicago want to see um in their Public Health commissioner mayor in addition to what you said a moment ago about the efforts of clergy stepping up to address the migrant crisis and your calls repeatedly on the state federal government to step in for help given all of that is it time for your office to acknowledge that the city is struggle to address the needs of this crisis I don't know which part of my time as in six months as a as mayor that we have not acknowledged that we cannot bear the responsibility alone that this responsibility of course has placed a tremendous amount of um stress on on families that that that has always been acknowledged but I guess specifically at our juncture now I mean it's it's we're in entering winter months it's getting colder I think people are curious about what is the the assessment of the proposed base camps I mean I don't know that people have seen tents pop up or or things happening so we have I think I understand your question I think I understand the second part of your your question is that what are we doing in this moment right I just see moving quickly enough to address this crisis well look I've stood up a brand new shelter every single week since I've been in office that we've renegotiated a contract uh with uh a staffing agency that I inherited to reduce costs we put out rfps uh for support for individuals who can help uh manage um um a facilities as well as provide food and support um but what we can't lose sight of is that the plan that I have put forth and I've carried out that it requires investments from the state and the federal government I've said that repeatedly I pushed hard for you know National policy to reflect the demands of this moment I've said from the very beginning that foreign policy particularly the sanctions that have been placed on Central and South America has exacerbated the economic turmoil that these countries have had to endure um as a result of bad foreign policy I'm grateful that President uh Biden has has eased those sanction sanctions it has caused um some level of stability uh around the Border um and they have to still do more and so my my my my work continues as we continue to administer our plan uh to remove people out of police stations who are sleeping on Floors pregnant women and children and putting them into a um temporary shelter that gives them a little bit more dignity is there any update on the 18 and California agreement that the city recently signed what what would you say to Alder Julia Ramirez she claimed for more transparency and Resident has been protesting that they don't want migrants over there well we continue to have conversations with Alders across the city and my job is to make sure that we are identifying sites that can ultimately help us deal with this crisis but make no mistake about it that the the plan that we have in place requires the state and the federal government to lean in to provide additional support now my my Administration has been very clear that without the state and federal government leaning in providing more financial support for our city um that that the sustainability of this operation just becomes that much more arduous um what about the agreement on the environmental issues over there so I'm glad you mentioned the environmental Dynamic that I'm dealing with as a as a as as mayor um you know it's why I've reinstituted the department of the environment it's why we push for this cumulative impact study quite frankly it's why we been that much more thorough on these sites to make sure um that that whatever environmental dynamics that exist there if it's not suitable you know we obviously will have to address that you know unfortunately environmental justice has not been the prevailing form of leadership in this city for a very long time my Administration has taken this head on and I'm confident that you know during this crisis um as we continue to explore other sites that if environmental hazards um do materialize then of course it's Inc coming upon my Administration as I I've committed to do is to address it I have another question do you have any information about migrants from Venezuela being deported from Gana airport to Venezuela I'm not aware of that very um I did find it interesting that Pastor Gordon told us he was on the trip since we never knew we went on the trip since we were never given a list of anyone who went on the trip good to hear it now but it would have been nice to hear it before but that's my comment not my question my question is there are reports of electricity being installed at the vacant lot at 115th in hallad today so why is there no official announcement that a tent city will is going to come when you've said you haven't made a decision but yet there's electricity being put in here's what I've said whether it's that particular site or or the site on 38th in California that we have assessed both of those sites and what needed to happen last week happened where um there was um an additional step of to make sure that um all voices were heard that have had um desires for that particular section of the city to be invested in now throughout this entire process I've had conversations with community members and the community uh particularly um in the 21st Ward um wanted to have yet another conversation and we did that and we have not made it uh we've always made it clear that the whole point of of of acquiring that land was not just for the economic development that we will see at the end of this crisis um at least this iteration of the crisis but the whole impetus behind that particular agreement was so that development would happen there so I've always been very clear about that particular site that it will ultimately become um a space where the people of the 21st Ward um will have an opportunity to grow and develop um but it also will be a site uh like many other sites that we are assessing to help us deal uh with this particular crisis go in so you know the the process by which these tents um are erected um it's actually quite thorough so you know as we continue to again not just assess the sites around environmental justice um but you know the entire capacity that these sites will ultimately be asked um to to carry um it's it's it's a coming upon my Administration to be as thorough as possible and so I'm moving with with with the expediency again the ultimate goal is to remove people out of police stations and get them um off the floors of police stations and and of course remove them from from outside so thank you all consider turn would you ever consider turning the buses around when the buses arrive here saying you know what there's no more room at the end we can no long we do no longer have the capacity to take anyone else maybe it's time to turn the buses around look do we need better immigration policy in this country everybody recognizes that and I've said this repeatedly you know that foreign policy and National policy um has not done um its due diligence to meet this particular crisis but the crisis that existed well beyond this moment and here's the part that's actually worth reporting I think it's my opinion is that when 30,000 ukrainians arrived in this city um who were seeking Refuge here there was no discussion none there are more Ukrainian just give me a second all right there are more Ukrainian um refugees here in the city of Chicago than Asylum Seekers and no one raised a single question and you know why because they had federal dollars attached to them what I'm simply saying is that if we're going to have real equity and parity in this country we have to make sure that our policies reflect um true equity and that they're consistent still", "aigc_title": "Mayor Brandon Johnson Discusses City's Approach to Migrant Crisis and Racial Divisions", "aigc_article": "In this video, Mayor

the top before I turn it over uh to Our Guest so I want to start out by noting that this week we celebrate two years since President Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure law in that short time this Administration has made historic progress in rebuilding America from breaking ground on major projects to rebuild our roads and bridges to delivering clean and clean and safer Safe Water to communities Across the Nation to cleaning up Legacy pollution expand expanding access to high-speed internet and building a clean energy economy here in the United States that supports good paying jobs so far the bipartisan infrastructure law has enabled us to launch 40,000 infrastructure projects and award in 4,500 communities across the country this historic investment in America has allowed up to more than 21 million lowincome households with access to free or discounted high-speed internet service through the affordable connectivity program that's what it's been able to provide those to 21 million low-income households start improvements on hundreds of thousands of miles of roads and thousands of bridge repairs help purchase more than 3,000 clean transit buses doubling their number on America's roadways as well as 2,400 clean school buses launch 2,300 projects to help communities build resilience to threat such as the impacts of climate change and cyber attacks and that is not all the bipartisan infrastructure law and the entirety of the president's investing in America agenda has spurred more than $614 billion in additional private sector manufacturing and clean energy Investments since President Biden took office not taxpayer dollars private sector Investments That is bolstering the president's work to create millions of good paying jobs including a record high number of jobs in the construction SE sector that's exactly what bionomics is all about investing in America and American workers to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up and with that uh we have Jake Sullivan here our national security adviser to talk through the president's trip to uh San Francisco uh this week and also the bilet that you all are going to see uh later today with President we Doo and take any other uh foreign policy questions that you all may have thank you Karen and thanks everybody it's uh obviously an extremely busy time so I apologize my opening comments are going to be a little bit longer than usual but if you bear with me I'll be able to answer whatever questions you have today President Biden kicks off a significant week of highlevel diplomacy that will showcase the breadth of America's strategic and economic engagement in the world and the value we place on deepening our alliances and Partnerships this afternoon in fact very shortly President Biden will host president Joko woto of Indonesia on the cusp of celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations between the United States and Indonesia our two countries will announce the elevation of our bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership a new chapter that will drive Innovation and prosperity and cooperation for both of our countries President Biden and president woto will have the opportunity to discuss a range of key issues including the clean energy transition critical minerals and deepening our security and defense cooperation on Wednesday as you have heard President Biden and president shei will meet in the Bay area for a summit we anticipate that the leaders will discuss some of the most fundamental elements of the US PRC bilateral relationship including the continued importance of strengthening open lines of communication and managing competition responsibly so that it does not Veer into conflict the way we achieve that is through intense diplomacy that's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises that's how we work together where and when our interests overlap and deliver on key priorities for the American people and that's why in recent months I've had the opportunity to meet with director Wong ye three times and it's why our secretaries of State Treasury and commerce all went to Beijing it's also why China for its part sent its vice president its foreign minister and other senior officials here to the United States in recent months President Biden comes into to this Summit on a solid footing given the ways in which he has positioned the United States to be able to compete effectively both at home and around the world at home we've had the strongest recovery and lowest inflation of any leading economy we've created 14 million jobs more jobs in two years than any president in a four-year term and we've had 21 straight months of unemployment under 4% for the first time in half a century abroad President Biden has deepened our alliances and Partnerships in just the last year he's hosted the leaders from Japan the r the Philippines India and Australia for bilateral meetings here in Washington he formerly launched Aus he held a historic trilateral Summit with the r and Japan at Camp David he upgraded our relations with Vietnam on a historic trip to Hanoi and he's hosted two Summits at the White House for Pacific island leaders as well as a special us Aion Summit finally at President Biden's Direction we've taken important steps to protect our national security we've put in place new rules on outbound investment and updated our export controls on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment and we've continued to uphold freedom of navigation in the region by flying sailing and operating wherever international law allows we're also looking for specific outcomes from the meeting on November 15th I won't get too far ahead of the meeting and I'll let the president uh speak for himself after he has the chance to meet with President XI but we believe that there are areas where our interests overlap like our efforts to combat the illicit fenel trade there are also areas where we can more effectively manage competition for example by reestablishing military to military Communications and there are of course critical Global issues that the two leaders will need to discuss including uh Russia's war against Ukraine and the evolving crisis in the Middle East all in all we're looking forward to a productive meeting President Biden has a long history with President XI their conversations are direct they're straight forward and President Biden believes that there is no substitute for leader to leer face-to-face diplomacy to manage this complex relationship between the United States and China of course this week President Biden will this coming week will be doing a lot more than just meeting with President XI he'll be welcoming leaders from across the Asia Pacific for Apec economic leaders week at a moment when the most dynamic economic region in the world is looking to the United States as the leading economy in the world while in San Francisco you'll see President Biden put forward his economic vision for the region he will speak about how the United States is the preeminent driver of inclusive sustainable economic growth in the Asia Pacific and how the Asia Pacific is critical to growth here at home you'll see the president join leaders from across the region to announce in record time clear outcomes on a number of pillars of the indopacific economic framework you'll see him hosting a partnership for Global infrastructure and investment PGI event with major CEOs and ipf governments that will demonstrate how we are identifying new ways of working with the US private sector to drive high standard investment in the Indo Pacific in infrastructure in Innovation and other areas to unlock sustainable long-term growth and we're also hosting an event with major foreign CEOs focused on how President Biden's economic policies combined with our strong partnership with Asia Pacific economies are driving historic and outsize Investments here in the United States in critical and emerging Technologies and in other areas and creating good paying jobs for American workers finally before I take questions I want to give a brief update on the Middle East the United States continues to work Round the Clock to support efforts to rescue and reunite hostages held by Hamas with their families where they belong this includes many young children one of whom is a three-year-old American citizen toddler whose parents were tragically killed by Hamas on October 7th this is a top priority for President Biden for vice president Harris for secretary blinkin for me personally we have all spoken with families of US citizens who are being held hostage by Hamas and have raised this issue with all of our counterparts this remains a Paramount priority for us just yesterday President Biden spoke with the Amir of cutter to discuss the important efforts and the important negotiations ongoing to try to secure the release of the hostages being held by Hamas and later today here at the White House I'll be meeting with some of the families of the Americans who are currently being helded the United States has also been leading efforts to increase the flow of life-saving sustained humanitarian assistance food water medicine into Gaza while we made some progress much more is urgently needed to alleviate suffering among the civilian population in Gaza we're glad to see Israel take an important step in this direction last week and we remain in active discussions with the Israeli government about the importance of tactical humanitarian pauses in the fighting to permit civilians to depart areas of active hostilities to increase the flow of Aid and to enable hostage releases we continue to have discussions at all levels including President Biden with prime minister Netanyahu to urge Israel to continue taking every possible measure to protect civilians the loss of a single innocent life is a tragedy whether it's a Palestinian civilian an Israeli civilian or anyone else and we grieve for every innocent who has lost at the same time we will continue to stand behind the proposition that Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and with Hamas as I've said you're dealing with an organization that has come out out publicly since October 7th and said that it intends to commit another October 7th and another one and another one until Israel no longer exists you have a leading spokesman from amas saying that the objective of the organization is a permanent state of war with Israel that is the reality that Israel is confronting and it's a reality that would be unacceptable for any nation and with that I would be happy to take your questions yeah thanks Jake uh you said yesterday and the president said just now in the Oval Office that hospitals in Gaza need to be protected do you believe that the Israelis have received that message and have they had any response so first uh what the president has just said and what I've said is that we do not want to see firefights in hospitals we want to see patients protected we want to see hospitals protected we have spoken with the Israeli government about this and they have said they share that view that they do not want to see firefights in hospitals and you've heard from IDF spokespeople uh stating things along those lines the Israeli government has also told us that they are prepared to provide fuel to hospitals to ensure that they can continue to operate and that the for certain hospitals they actually have not been able to be in communication with the people who are actually running the hospital so that's something we will continue to work on but the position of the United States on this matter is clear hospitals should be protected hospitals should be able to run effectively so that Medical Care should be can be given to patients and finally to the extent people need to be evacuated from one Hospital to another hospital in order to ensure the continuation of care evacuation routes have to be safe and the Israeli government has told us as recently is today that there are and will continue to be evacuation routes for uh people leaving hospital compounds so these are positions that for us are straightforward they are clear we have a constructive discussion with the Israeli government on this and I believe that they have indicated they hold similar positions on these issues now as for what happens on the ground you know in a given hour on a given day we can't react to every individual report we can simply continue to State our position and continue to consult with the Israeli government uh to ensure that they are doing their best to fulfill their stated position on this and more broadly the US is now focused on two Wars one in the Middle East one in Ukraine what would it mean for this government and in particular uh foreign policy and the military if there were to be a government shut down come Friday night this would be a devastating blow first of all to our service members at a very human level because it would have an impact on uh the ability of our troops to and their families to get all of the benefits and services that they deserve for the service they are performing for our country second it would send a signal to the world that the United States cannot pull together on a bipartisan basis to sustain Government funding and to show United face to the world uh at a moment where you see this turbulence around the world so we will do everything in our power uh to support Congress coming together around a measure that will fund the government and not have a shutdown occur at the end of this week well the President also said there's an effort to use the pause to deal with the release of prisoners and it's being negotiated with Qatar could you amplify on that a little bit yes uh there have been ongoing discussions with the government of cter and in fact President Biden as I mentioned in my opening statement spoke by telephone with the Amir of cutter yesterday cter has been talking to Hamas Israel has been talking to Cutter the United States has been talking to both Israel and cter in an effort uh to try to move forward these negotiations to a point where hostages can be released and reunited with their families we're not there yet but we are continuing to try to make progress on that day by day hour by hour and as I said before the president has no higher priority which is why he is personally engaged on this issue on the trip itself what does the president plan to tell president X in terms of getting Iran to reign in his process y attacks on US forces in the Middle East well from our perspective the PRC should share the interest of every responsible country that deescalation rather than escalation in the broader broader Middle East should be the order of the day so President Biden will make the point to president XI that Iran acting in an escalatory destabilizing way that undermines uh stability across the broader Middle East is not in the interests of of the PRC or of any other responsible country and the PRC of course has a relation ship with Iran and it's capable if it chooses to of making those points directly to the Iranian government yeah um yesterday you to U Israeli intelligence this does the US have any independent intelligence that Hamas has military facilities a bunker under P ala Hospital in Gaza well what I said yesterday is that I'm not in a position to comment on intelligence matters American intelligence matters I can't divulge that to you what I can tell you is that we see plenty of Open Source reporting about hamas's use of hospitals and other civilian infrastructure to store weapons to house Fighters uh to engage in in forms of command and control but beyond that I'm not in a position to to speak specifically to a report about a specific hospital or specific bunker and so when President says that hospitals must be protected um what does the president what does the United States want to see done with ala Hospital in particular and theas Facilities that used now put to open source intelligence why under it well your question points up the complexity of this conflict and the added burden that Israel is facing as it goes against murderous terrorists who continue to say their goal is the absolute destruction of the state of Israel you're dealing with a terrorist organization Hamas that takes civilian uh hostages including little children that uses civilians as human Shields that uses civilian infrastructure even hospitals in the most cynical way possible that is as fighting positions as uh military operation centers and so Israel has to confront that while at the same time not wanting to go assaulting hospitals in firefights that could put innocent people who are getting life-saving Medical Care in the crossfire so there are not easy answers to this question but this is the complexity this is the burden that the Israeli Defense Forces are facing as they uh conduct their operations and our position is that Israel has the right to go after Hamas but it does face this added burden and that burden does not lessen its responsibility to act according to the laws of war and so how that plays out in a particular operational Dynamic this tunnel or that bunker ultimately those decisions lie with the the military fighting the United States can't dictate that but we will continue to stand for the principle that the laws of war must be respected even as Israel goes after Hamas and the tools and infrastructure of its terrorism yeah do you have any proof of Life on hostages especially the Americans in the negotiations that have been going on has there been anything that could reassure sure the negotiators the president you that hostages remain alive and potentially could be rescued so we have been very transparent about the fact that we have limited visibility into both the whereabouts of the hostages within Gaza and their condition and and I said as recently as yesterday that we have nine missing Americans one missing green card holder and I cannot look in the eye and tell you how many of those hostages are still alive we do have information and I'll be careful about how I characterize that um about some of the hostages and and and a notion that there are a substantial number of hostages who are not just alive but who could potentially be part of a hostage release but I couldn't give you a number of exactly how many Americans would be included in that that's something that we will have to work through as we continue these negotiations and of course we won't know for certain until we we actually get the release of those hostages and they're safely returned to their families so that's something we're going to continue to work on uh thanks I want to ask about the house spending proposal it does not include money for National Security priorities uh that the Administration has uh Israel Ukraine particularly Ukraine uh what are the next steps for getting funding if if the spending proposal is not an option so I will leave it to Karen to kind of talk about the Congressional Dynamics and particular measures that have been put forward in the house what I will say is that the the president the Biden Administration put forward a funding request for Israel for Ukraine for the Indo Pacific and for the Border uh we detailed exactly what we needed including for Ukraine and we still need that and we need it as soon as we can get it and we are working actively with both the house and the Senate both Republicans and Democrats to secure the votes and to get the vote to get that funding and I continue to remain confident that while this has been a Winding Road since we began the effort to secure additional funding for Ukraine that there is a strong bipartisan majority in both houses to do it and we will ultimately get it done how exactly through what vehicle and what measure that's something that I will defer to the legislative experts on I will only say that we are continuing to make the case actively I'm on the phone personally daily with members both Democrats and Republicans to make the case and we are leaning forward in making it clear that the United States national interest will be deeply harmed if we are not able to secure and sustain funding for Israel Ukraine the Indo Pacific and the Border if I may ask about the trip please um what what is the president's message going to be regarding taiwan's upcoming elections will the will the president warn president shei directly for example against interfering in the elections I I'm not going to preview what exactly President Biden will say to president shei because I think he should have the opportunity to speak to him directly in person without me proclaiming it from the podium I will say that the president broadly speaking is going to set out um a vision for peace and stability and the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan straight and he will do that in his meeting with President sheep but in terms of the specifics of that conversation I will lead that to the president to do personto person face to face yeah thank you Jake how confident is the US that the US and China can restore military to military Communications it's now been more than a year since ch suspended those talks so what are the main sticking points from the Chinese side I'll defer to well not defer to refer to China on the sticking points because ultimately they'll have to answer that for themselves the United States has been ready for that entire period to sustain military to military Communications because we think it's the only responsible thing to do having our two militaries in communication is the way you reduce mistake you avoid escalation you manage competition so it doesn't beer into cont conflict that to us is an absolutely straightforward factor and no matter what else is happening in the relationship those military to military links should remain intact that's our position going into San Francisco we believe that uh the PRC has been constructive in the dialogue we've been having with them on this issue uh we will see what happens in San Francisco and the president will be able to report after the meeting whether in fact we've made progress on restoring military to military LS why the Chinese has been willing to engage so much more in recent months how much of it has to do with China's economic struggles and if that's the case how can you be sure that what comes out of Apec is long lasting and not just tactical from the Chinese side well look I'm not going to speculate as to what China's motives are again that's a question you should pose to them and and they can lay it out for you I do think your question raises an important point though which is nothing stands still in the world as we've just seen from the October 7th crisis and there will be you know inevitably things that arise that are unanticipated there will be turbulence as there always is and the question is can we create the lines of communication and the broad parameters in the relationship so that through whatever comes we can manage competition responsibly so it doesn't Veer into conflict that's what the president has set out to achieve in this Summit with President XI and so he sees this not just as a one-off meeting but as an important moment to be able to establish the kind of basis upon which we can proceed out into the future future J you mentioned that you guys see this as an important meeting on Wednesday but I'm curious will the president during his time with the Chinese president try to hold China accountable for the Spy balloon this year I know obviously it seems like it was 20 years ago but it was this year the Chinese have said it was still a weather balloon they said they should get the technology back what kind of response are we going to see from the president this week on spy well as I said before I'm going to let the president be able to sit down with President XI and speak to him personto person face to face and again not be doing diplomacy from the podium and we can report to you afterwards consistent with whatever um you know is appropriate to share publicly on these issues but I will say that uh President Biden took steps to uh take down that balloon once it was safe to do so and out of potential Harm's Way to civilians we were able to recover it to exploit it and from our perspective the critical thing is that uh because we were able to protect ourselves along the way of that path we do not feel that there was any information gain that was problematic and so the United States the president is going to focus at this point on how he stands up for and protects American interests going forward across the full range of challenges in this relationship of which this is one you want T to apologize again I'm going to let President Biden speak to president XI I'm not going to stand here from the podium and and kind of create threats or raise questions or make particular demands because I think that will not be the most effective way to secure the Diplomatic outcomes the American people are looking for Than Jake how would you rate relations between the US and China since President Biden's meeting with President XI last year and what would you say that the US has been able to achieve in the relationship as a direct result of their last meeting well first the most important thing is that this is a complex relationship a competitive relationship that could easily Veer into conflict or confrontation if it's not well managed and so managing the relationship in an effective way is the single most important responsibility of the president and everyone who works for him on this file and then beyond that the US and China have to be able to speak directly to one another on all of the critical issues that face our two countries including issues uh in moments of Crisis like the Russia Ukraine crisis and President Biden has had a number of candid conversations with president she about the question of Military Support to the Russian Federation in the conduct of its war in Ukraine President Biden has had the opportunity to engage and so have the rest of us on how we effectively manage peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait so that we can sustain peace and stability across the Taiwan straet so those are some of the issues that through intense diplomacy we have been able to manage intense competition and then we will look for opportunities to actually generate affirmative outcomes that deliver tangible progress for the American people in areas where our interest overlap I mentioned for example the issue of fentanyl we're hoping to see some progress on that issue this coming week and that could then open the door to further cooperation on other issues where we aren't just managing things but we're actually delivering uh tangible results we'll continue to work at that as we go forward yeah the us yesterday launched its third round of strikes against facilities tied to Iran that were in Syria I mean you've said that this is in part to try to to deter other attacks against uh US service members but in the hours since that attack at least four times US forces were hit uh in an attack so how is this a success if these incidents keep happening over and over our goal over time is to ensure that our forces are protected and that we respond if we get hit that is what we have done that is what we will continue to do and this should be measured over the course of time not over the course of 24 hours now if Iranian proxies continue to strike American forces we will continue to respond President Biden has been straightforward about that we have followed through on that we will continue to follow through on that because the president's view is ultimately he has got to look out and Safeguard the security and the physical safety of all of our forces in both Iraq and Syria we're going to continue to do that and we have made clear that if we continue to get hit we will respond yeah an updated timeline for one the current funding to Ukraine is going to run now so I mean there's not a literal day on the clock but each week that passes our ability to fully fund what we feel is necessary to give Ukraine the tools and capacities it needs to both defend its territory and to continue to make advances that gets harder and harder so for us the window is closing but I cannot point to a date on the calendar because of course this is a dynamic situation and we have to make decisions about draw down packages how we size them what gets based on our assessment of the calendar of when we're actually going to get a bill passed so I can tell you it is already having an effect on our ability uh to give Ukraine everything that it needs and that effect will only compound over time we are still able to supply uh the military assistance uh that Ukraine has been asking for but if we got the full funding we could do so on a much more certain and consistent basis and that's what we're looking for report that President Biden and president CH are going to agree to a ban on the use of artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons are you able to confirm that or AI will be a part of the discussion at all of course AI will be part of the discussion but I cannot confirm that report I saw it this morning and I'm not exactly sure where it came from yeah thanks a lot Jake what's your level of confidence that China has not provided to Russia any military equipment or Munitions or technology uh as it relates to Russia's war against Ukraine our latest assessment is that Russia uh excuse me China has not provided weapons to Russia as part of the war in Ukraine uh but I will come back to you to confirm that remains our latest assessment as of today because my information is a few days old and then on Gaza if I may uh what's your satisfaction level as it relates to what was announced last week this humanitarian pause would you like to see longer pauses Beyond just four 4 hours a day uh do you expect that to happen well first I think there are circumstances where more than 4 hours a day is going to be necessary and in fact the Israel government has recognized that they've extended some of these pauses to 7 hours for example to create the corridor so that people can move around safely We Believe pauses should not be dictated by a strict timetable they should be dictated by what is necessary to achieve the objectives and those objectives are safe passage uh the ability to move around humanitarian Aid and then ultimately we'd like to see considerably longer pauses days not hours uh in the context of a hostage release and that's being actively worked on as well yeah um on the five Army special ops horses that were killed in a helicopter crash in the Mediterranean over the weekend because they were there as part of the force buildup because of what's happening in Israel would you consider their deaths American casualties of that war I would not uh I would refer you to DOD for what the formal assessment would be but I would tell you just is a straightforward matter we have forces deployed around the world in every theater and tragically these training accidents do occur this accident did not occur in combat it occurred during a training Mission and so uh that's why from my perspective it would not be from this war yeah thank you Jake I have two questions on Gaza um I 100 the stuff at the state department and usid accused the Biden administration of spreading misinformation the Israeli newspaper herot actually some of the Israelis were killed were killed by Israeli Army on October 7th and the number is 1,200 not 1400 that's not taken away from um what happened on October 7th but you were adamant that you do not trust the Palestinian sources when it comes to casualties so accurate information is vital especially in fighting anti-Semitism and islamophobia so does the white have credibility when it comes to um information and accurate information information can we rely on you when you at the podium and tell us certain information and statements when I know information I will tell it to you when I don't know information I'm not certain about it as earlier in this uh discussion when we were talking about the number of American hostages who are still alive those who may have been actually killed by Hamas I will tell that to you if we get new information that supersedes the information we have before I will tell that to you and we have a track record from day one of this Administration to do all of those things we will continue to do that every day and I categorically reject the notion that we're pedaling any misinformation yeah thanks Jake you said today uh as you said a number of times about the importance of the laws of war being upheld um Israel has killed around 11,000 Palestinians IR 2ir of those are women and children uh the situation in the hospitals is di israels have dropped an astronomical amount of uh ordinance in very built up areas is Israel in your view abiding by the laws of war and if it is how you come to that conclusion well as I said yesterday I Jake Sullivan standing here am not in a position to be judge and jury to make that determination it's a legal determination what I can do is state for you the clear policy of the Biden Administration which we have been unequivocal about from the beginning of this conflict and that is that even though Hamas is using civilians as human Shields is burrowing into civilian areas with its rocket and placements that they are continuing to launch every single day at civilian areas in Israel that puts an added burden on the IDF but it does not lessen their responsibility to act in ways that separate terrorists from civilians and does everything in their power to protect civilian lives that is that was the case that remains the case today that is the message that we've said publicly and we communicate to our Israeli counterparts privately and we do that on a daily basis to be clear though the administration's view is that the idea is doing that what I told you is that I am not in a position to give you a legal determination to your question I am not in a position do that what I'm in a position to do is to State the US government position on how Israeli operation should be conducted and that is what I have done that is what I continue to do that is what I can do from this Podium yeah thank Jake did Governor gav New give the White House a heads up on his meeting with president shei and have you guys gotten a read out from his team since and what did you make of all that we we had a heads up we got a readout in fact Ambassador Nick Burns accompanied that delegation on that meeting so it was fully coordinated between the governor's office and and the US state department um of course I won't get into the details of that because uh those were private diplomatic conversations but we've had a good opportunity to get a download as we have from Senator Schumer's bipartisan delegation and Senator Schumer and I actually just spoke today about some of the outcomes of that conversation which are feeding into work the president will do this week and hopefully help result in some tangible progress yeah thank you so much uh do you intend some stage to provide more details about the kind of military equipment Israel is getting from the United States and the way it's using it uh yes the Department of Defense will lay out what we are providing to Israel I've stood up here before and told you about some of the key elements of that which have included interceptors for Iron Dome artillery ammunition Precision guided Munitions um and so the dod and the state department will follow normal protocol in laying out the sales and transfers of weapons to Israel yeah thank you Jake I have a question on your meeting with yac but first on the BAC as I understand President we Doo will be bringing the resolution from the organization of Islamic cooperation which includes uh demand for immediate ceasefire and rejection of Israel's justification that its actions in Gaza is self-defense so clearly on the international stage President Biden is losing ground on this issue we see this at the UN every day my question is is he ever at all concerned that he may be on the wrong side of History here and how does he plan to engage with President R Doo on this issue President Biden uh is looking forward to engaging with President woto across the full range of issues in the bilateral relationship and Regional and Global issues on many issues they will agree wholeheartedly in fact they'll make significant progress on other issues they will have different perspectives president wot's position on the conflict in Gaza is well known so is President Biden's they'll both have the opportunity to respectfully exchange views on that issue they will also have the opportunity to elevate the US Indonesia bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership and to make tangible progress on issues like critical minerals like clean energy cooperation and like investment so you will see in this the the fullness of the relationship between the United States and IND I but also the robustness of that relationship and the way in which it has advanced over the course of the past three years notwithstanding the fact that there are differences of perspective on certain aspects of the ongoing crisis yeah San Francisco has cleaned up their streets ahead of President Biden and president she's meeting they moved homeless to other parts of the city cleared tent cities and trash off the street is the president embarrassed that an American city needs to go through a total makeover to be presentable for his out of town guests the president is incredibly proud of the record that the United States will bring as host to this Summit and I went through some of it today the strongest economic record of any developed country the lowest unemployment over a sustained period in half a Century far-reaching Investments in innovation in ships uh rebuilding America's infrastructure so actually the Joe Biden thinks he is walking into the summit on the front foot and able to showcase the United States as the Premier destination for investment good job creating investment here in the United States all of which will be on display while he is there and the countries the world who are coming are coming with a recognition that the United States is in a strong indeed for a lot of people and enviable economic position and that is going to I think sustain him very effectively through the course of the week but Governor gav said of the clean up this I know folks are saying oh they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming to town that's true does President Biden agree it's more important to impress the leader of China than the American people that live in San Francisco and pay taxes every day first I completely reject the premise of your question but secondly I don't know what the context of what governor Nome said so I I won't respond to it uh last question secretary Lincoln said there were ham tunnels under schools hospitals and mosqu does the US have Intelligence on this outside of what's in the public domain to support so I can't speak to intelligence BNS as I've said before and I feel hamstrung by that because um obviously we have intelligence sources ourselves but I'm not in a position today to be able to share that intelligence and is it fair to say the conflict in the Middle East is now on at least three fronts Israel Hamas Israel hea and US Iranian prophecies I think it's I I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a freefun conflict I would accept that there is an exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah there's an obvious ongoing military operation in Gaza yes we have been struck repeatedly by proxy groups of the irgc in Iraq and Syria and we have responded those are all that that is all correct thank you guys thank you so much Jake okay let's continue good uh the Supreme Court uh today unveiled code of ethics uh on justices um there's LW of scrutiny of of justices of conflict of interest um has the president CH reviewed that does he have position on it does he believe it goes far enough so um I'm not going to get uh add more to uh or go beyond what the president has said already in the Pro publica interview that he shared when it re when we talked about um when he was asked about the Supreme Court ethics so there are ethics rules that apply to to other and lower lower federal courts obviously and so obviously the American people have the right uh to to expect uh those who are serving in high office to meet High ethics and transparency obviously standards and so but I don't have beyond that I know the president has talked about this recently and then there's a security incident overnight U uh the secret service agent uh apparently fired a shot uh an attempted uh car vehicle fft breaking the Secret Service vehicle regarding one of the president's grandchildren has the president been bried on that incident and does he believe that secret service handled that appropriately so for any questions about uh security matters I would have to refer you to the Secret Service any questions again any questions referring to this I would have to oh I totally understand the this is personal information anything that deals with personal information I would refer you to the secret service especially as we're talking about a security matters lastly um Jake just said he felt hamstrung by his inability to release U us intelligence assessments of Hamas activities um has the president given any consideration to potentially declassifying that uh that intelligence we've seen downgrade regarding all sorts of sensitive uh us collections in the Ukraine context U but has the president considered that and uh in regards to what Hamas is doing allegedly under these hospitals I just don't have anything to add to what Jake Sullivan our national security advisor shared today at the podium get thanks green um this year Auto thefts are way up carjackings are way up uh violent crime is way up here in DC a couple of members of Congress were attacked now this overnight How concerned is the president about the increase of crime in this city where so many government workers live so we are definitely concerned about what we're seeing and not just here across the country obviously and that's why the president's first uh first year in this Administration uh he made sure to get to pass to get past the American Rescue plan and he did that with Democrats and not one Republican vote and in that American Rescue plan there was uh there was billions of dollars that were provided to local cities to make sure that they were able to hire police officers and make sure that they have they felt like they could have a safer and more effective uh accountability uh Community account policing accountability and that is why he took those actions last year as you know back in August of last year he he talked about a safer safer American America plan again trying to call on Congress uh to invest over 3.35 billion dollars to fund uh police and fight crime and so the president has taken actions he would like to uh do this in a bipartisan way with Republicans on the other clearly uh uh in Congress and they haven't done that and they've used this as a political weapon as a political talking point while the president has taken action to make sure our communities are safer are we concerned obviously we want to make sure Americans and their families feel safe in not just here in DC but across communities but we can't do this alone the president again has taken action he's with the American Rescue plan BL billions of dollars were able to go into States into communities so that they can they can provide um funding and police and police officers to make sure that their communities are safe but we need more we need Congress to act that's why he put forward the safer America plan $35 billion Congress can act what does the president need to know about this laded CR before rendering a judgment on it so we're going to let the negotiations uh continue uh we're going to be in close contact with Democrats in both the house and the Senate the leadership there and have make sure that they are having their conversations to see the best path forward for the American people and that's what the president spoke to I think there's he said there was going to a conversation happening later this afternoon or pretty much very soon and so we're just going to let that be um thanks Ken so the house plan includes no Aid to Israel or Ukraine is the White House still confident that their supplemental funding request could pass on its own and what vehicles remain here for Ukraine so look um Jake spoke about this very well from here and talked about the importance of making sure that we continue to fun fund Ukraine making sure that uh we have funding for Israel as well uh I'm not going to get into legislative negotiations from here from the podium but look I'm going to be very clear lives are at stake right the the National Security uh um supplemental that we put forward is incredibly important it's important for our national security uh also let's not forget the domestic uh uh supplemental as well so it's important for for our needs here or needs across across the globe and so look we're going to not negotiate from here but I think Jake laid it out very clearly the importance of continuing to fund Ukraine and the importance of uh the funding that we've asked for Israel you've called the latter see unserious what deal with the White House you willing to accept given all the stakes you laid out so look I mean let's be very clear here I know there's been a lot of questions on on this and the supplemental um look House Republicans are threatening a government shutdown that's what we're seeing right now that uh would hurt our economy uh that would hurt our national security as I just spoke to and in September we saw this happen where House Republicans threatened to shut down the government unless uh they got their radical uh radical demands then they shut then they shut down Congress for three uh for three chaotic weeks as they try to figure out who their next speaker was going to be after outing the last speaker and so look you know there's work to be done they have to get the work done they got to keep the government open and so negotiations are going to be happening Democrat we're going to continue to talk to Democratic Leadership on the house and the Senate and uh and uh and so that we can make sure that we're moving forward in a way that's that's best for the American people and as I stated the LA this latest proposal is very much untested it is it's untested and where they could have uh you know avoided this weeks ago but instead they were in their own chaos this is I'm speaking about the house of Republicans here and so we're going to continue to have those conversation with Democratic Leadership is the president concerned that City crime could get this close to his family look I'm not going to uh speak to um uh the incident that's something for Secret Service to speak to not going to talk about it from here I spoke to uh the crime more broadly and what the president has done since almost day one of his administration starting with the his first piece of legislation that he signed into law with which is the American Rescue plan billions of dollars going into cities going into states to make make sure that they have the funding available to protect communities to hire police officers that's something that the president is concerned not just here uh in in the district but across the across the country as it relates to anything else uh I would have to refer you to the Secret Service na Biden had been a resident here at the White House and I wonder when did that change that she would move to her own residence with her husband this is a personal matter this is personal information certainly not going to speak from it from the podium I would have to refer you to the Secret Service one more thing president frequently talks about the fact that he speaks to his grandchildren every day do you know if he has spoken with Naomi Biden since this occurred I'm not going to get into private conversations that the president has with his family as he stated himself he is uh speaks his grandchildren regularly he's very close to his family I'm just not going to get into confirming conversations with his family good follow quick question Kelly has the White House considered having mayor Bowser back over here just to talk about crime in general I know she was here I think early when the president took office but I'm just curious any interest maybe here we we are in regular conversations with mayor Bowser about an array of issues a range of issues that uh that is important to the residents here obviously in in Washington DC that is something that is continuous uh we have a an a uh intergovernmental Affairs office here and so we are in touch with her as mayor of DC but also other Mayors and governors across uh across the country uh look I've said this moments ago and I'll say it again we've been very serious on dealing with uh the crime that have seen just across the country and we'd love to work with Republicans on this they have not been serious on this uh the president again put forth the American Rescue plan signed that into law put billions of dollars into communities to help uh help Mayors and and uh and governors deal with crime in their city and their states but Republicans aren't serious he put forth the safer America's plan $35 billion to continue to invest and make sure that we're actually dealing with this type of crime we don't hear anything from them so House Republicans more broadly in Congress if they want to get this done we're really need to work with them I'm going to keep going I'm going to keep going I'm going to keep I'm going working but thanks meta platform said that it's going to require advertisers disclose when artificial intelligence or other digital tools are used in Facebook or Instagram ads on social issues elections and politics I wanted to find out what Pres thinks about that uh so don't have anything to share on their new policy uh meta's new policy obviously the president put forward a pretty comprehensive uh AI uh executive order recently uh and so outside of that I'm just not going to not going to really comment on private uh entities and and actions that they're taking but obviously the president takes this very seriously and you could see that with the comprehensive uh executive order that he put forward uh that touches on many uh many important uh many import important parts of different Industries obviously the goal here is to protect Americans could you speak more broadly about what the president thinks social media platform should be doing within the next couple months to prepare for potential AI generated misinformation on their platforms especially going into an election season so I'm going to be very careful because you're asking me about election season don't want to speak to that from here uh obviously we take this very seriously because we put forth a an executive order very recently uh that is seen as being uh comprehensive that is seen as being transformative uh and that is something that we can do hear from the federal government uh I'm just not going to talk to talk about private companies from here and what they're going to do in uh in the upcoming election thank you Ken I wanted to follow up on the twostep uh CR the Republicans are putting uh out you've previously said that this would be a recipe for chaos and more shutdowns I'm wondering what the president's message is to um those house Democrats who seem at least intrigued by this proposal for instance uh Minnesota representative Dean Phillips uh has said the speaker Johnson's twep CR quote isn't perfect but a whole lot better than a shutdown so look the latest proposal as I just said is definitely untested and that's true it is untested uh we are going to continue and this is something that the president was saying in the Oval Office just moments ago before we came out to the uh into the briefing rooms we're going to in touch with Democratic Leadership in both the house and the Senate and uh our goal our number one goal is to make sure that we move uh we take the best path forward uh for the American people that's what we're going to focus on but it is this is indeed untested uh and uh that is uh that is something that uh we're seeing coming from them and look this is something that they could avoid it and instead of avoiding where we are right now just a couple days away from a government shutdown they've wasted time they have wasted time so Democratic Leadership is going to have that conversation in both the house and the Senate on how to best move forward there was there was upate there was an update I the uh house oversight committee has now issued a subpoena for the former White House Council Dana Remis they're also asking for four other transcript interviews with White House employees regarding the classified documents that were found inov or in Wellington I'm just curious with the White House support cooperating with the committee's oversight and specifically with this subpoena for Dana Reas I'm just not going to comment from here which is consistent with what we've been doing from here go ahead thank you follow up on on Phil's question uh will the house Democrats uh know the president's position on whether or not he would sign that continuing resolution before they have to vote on it well the president literally just talked about this one of your colleagues asked uh asked him about this particular CR and he said that he wants to there there's going to be conversations on the hill negotiations on the hill and he wants to talk to uh the leadership and so that's in the Democratic House and Senate and that's what we're going to do don't have anything else to share I'm just going to go to back go ahead back thanks green uh some Democrats particularly in and around the squad have openly disagreed with the president for being too supportive of Israel there's also been some grassroot groups that backed the president and are now indicating that this could be a deal breaker for them is the president worried that this will continue to be a wedge issue within the party and why can't he get his Democrats on the same page on this issue so look you know in our party there's going to be various range of agreements and disagreements and and that's the way it is right and in particular in the Democratic party the president's going to continue to be clear about this you heard it at the top uh when when uh Jake Sullivan was giving an update on the Middle East where the president stands the president has been very clear uh and uh when it comes to Israel and what we saw on October 7th Israel has the right to defend itself they have the right to defend itself and so we're going to support Israel in doing that uh obviously there is the rule of law right that the that Jake talked about that we believe that should be followed and uh and uh you know we're going to continue to to be uh steadfast in what we believe and what how we see this moving forward and making sure we just talked about the supplemental the National Security Supplemental and making sure Israel has what it's need Ukraine has with it's need let not forget they are dealing with terrorism and tyranny that's what they're dealing with they're dealing with an organization like Hamas who was a terrorist organization who had said and Jake talked about this a leader from the Hamas organization said that they would want to see in October 7th happen over and over and over and over again and that's what Israel is dealing with all right one last question go ahead BR in the back great thank you um President Biden and president she are expected to talk about combating elicit fenals what outcome is he looking for here in that talk well look I'm just going to say this I'm not going to get ahead of uh obviously that's going to be a discussion that they're going to have I'm going to let the president uh speak to that himself they're going to have that leader to leer conversation as Jake said moments ago and and the president will have more to share once he has his meeting with President G can you just talk about the importance of addressing this issue oh it's critical it's important this is something that we've talked about and taken very seriously when it comes to fentol and getting that off our streets uh certainly uh we are certainly focused on making sure that we protect Americans and American famili so obviously this is an important uh agenda item that the president wants to uh have to discuss this fent andol getting taking getting that off our streets uh is C certainly a critical uh a critical um uh conversation that we need to continue to have and the president certainly has taken actions uh on doing that all right thanks everybody we'll see you on the road thank you", "aigc_title": "White House Press Secretary and National

convicted of domestic violence to legally purchase or possess firearms in Wisconsin it's being introduced in response to the 2022 Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision in the dubac verse call case the Court held that disorderly conduct related to demestic violence does not disqualify someone from Legally buying a gun proponents of the new bill say this legislation is needed to ensure that victims of abuse in Wisconsin are safer legislation today is simple and St straightforward but absolutely cleare eyed in the mission to make sure that Wisconsin does not allow people who are victimized uh by domestic violence to be victimized by a partner with a firearm that should have been taken away the bill would reorganize the disorderly conduct statute to separate violent conduct from other types of disorderly conduct so the record clearly indicates if a crime was violent we've mentioned before the importance of making sure you and your family are protected as respiratory illness season inches closer some of the most at risk are children and in this week's Time for Kids report our jayen banks caught up with a local pharmacist on the importance of those vaccines for your children with respiratory illnesses flaring up this time of the year washing your hands and wearing a mask are some good ways to protect yourself and as for your kids as you send them out the door for school the best way you can battle those illnesses is getting them vaccinated kids are exposed to a lot of different illnesses at school and pharmacists say vaccines are the biggest weapon in PR preventing them from getting sick we have a brand new coid vaccine and so it's important to get a flu shot every year and this year we have um a a vaccine to cover us for RS you're being a good role model more people will come and get their vaccine for Co anyone ages 6 months and up are eligible flu vaccines have similar guidelines and for RSV there's one for children to an under farmacist say even though they're seeing signs of vaccine fatigue from the public it's still important to stay up to date we understand that people are hesitant um we understand that people are kind of burned out on the whole idea of

her pumpkins one Middleton woman's heart is anything but Hollow for the animals in her neighborhood she takes leftover pumpkins from other people's fall decorations to give to the animals in her yard our Catherine mck shows us how she hopes her efforts plant a seed for others to do the same this retired Middleton woman says she's collected her neighbor's pumpkins for years and she feels anyone can carve out some time to help out their Wildlife this time of year I put him out whole like this Beth Mackey isn't tricking the Animals by tomorrow this will have been dug into usually by squirrels after the Halloween holiday she's giving them a treat that'll last a while I have been collecting pumpkins to give to Wildlife for probably five years and every year it I get more in her garage there's a method to my madness you can find nearly a 100 pumpkins I mean I'm giving up my parking spot in our garage for the pumpkins she tells her neighbors and friends to bring over their leftover orange decorations to her 5 acre backyard to to feed the critters we're passionate about wildlife and helping them out she says this time of year anyone can pick this up you can just roll them under a an evergreen or under a bush or even just put them in the corner of your backyard and they'll quickly consume it and by Spring it will be totally gone in Beth's yard she leaves her version of a candy bowl out year round it's not that hard to do actually and those who come to visit can take more than one piece everything we have here pretty much they can have if they want if you do want to follow in Beth's footsteps and get rid of your own Pumpkins this way just make sure you don't put any pumpkins with paint on them out for the animals as that can be bad for them to snack on well the

morning we're live at the Goodman center with how you can give back this holiday season well an update under annual Thanksgiving basket drive and we'll have an update on the mild temperatures throughout the week into of the weekend join us tomorrow morning between 4:30 and [Music] 7 well Wisconsin isn't just a hockey school right now they are the premier hockey School in the country both the badger men and women are the number one teams in the country in this week's usch poll the women who have held the top spot all year have a national championship rematch with number two Ohio State this weekend while the men who began the year unranked are 9- one and are number one for the first time since preseason 2006 they'll play 11th ranked Michigan State this weekend with all the hype and expectations it's easy to forget that Luke fickle went just 4 and eight in his first season at Cincinnati before leading those Bearcats to the college football playoff just a few years later here at Wisconsin and tell guys that he recruited start showing up like it or leave it he's largely coaching the same team that went seven and six last year but it begs the question how did is year one at Wisconsin compared to year one at Cincinnati I don't know maybe it's the expectations that we walked into maybe it's what I truly had envisioned you know the things I thought we could be as we grew um but in general I think it just you know have an expectation for myself and the things that we do that were far greater now than they were seven years ago and so this is and continues to be and and is uh a hell of a lot more challenging Wisconsin volley 's loss at Penn State on Saturday was just their second loss of the Season not that the 23 and2 Badgers want to lose but when all you do is win losses are really your best chance to grow Kelly Sheffield says there is a different energy when you lose a match it induces the process of figuring out what happened and finding out how to attack that that's the process that gets him out of bed in the morning that process is a for me is a lot of fun I I enjoy that do I enjoy losing hell no but there's such an opportunity of learning and I think Elite athletes when when things are exposed and you approach it in a learning way that fires them up and no your eyes are not deceiving you after nearly a decade managing the Brewers and many more with the organization Craig council is officially a cub Chicago welcome their new Skipper in an introductory press conference today and that's going to take some getting used to we we wish him

learning experience in tonight's feature story Jacqueline maycumber is the state representative of Washington's 7eventh District which includes Douglas Okanagan and part of Grant County maycumber says she ran for the house to try and help rural kids learn skills they could bring back to their communities last week she told NCW life Jefferson Robbins that legislation she SE successfully sponsored earlier this year may help to do just that growing up in Eastern Washington and seeing as a graduation went and our kids left and they had to go to other places to become successful or become educated um you know making sure our our kids have the same opportunities as we did and I you know I didn't really see that happening in the last few years so making sure that they have the opportunity to education the economic opportunities and then the futures in our community that we're not exporting our greatest Generation or our greatest commodity and that's our kids well one thing that uh you brought up brought forward through the house talking about kids and opportunities was House Bill 1013 which established Regional apprenticeship programs for the trades what spurred that and and what kind of effects do you expect the bill to have well I'm very excited it's been signed into law so um right here in Douglas County we're going to see the great benefits hopefully soon uh so what it did it's kind of like running start for the trades so instead of College you should have the opportunity to learn some um skills and some trades for your future and the trade the Building Trades and a lot of other trades from um medical field to the to um anything from Plumbing you need those skills and I saw kids graduating high school with not understanding you know what their skill set is what they felt good about and hope really hope for the future if you knew you were going to go to college you had that opportunity but if you didn't where would you go and asking them to move somewhere was a little more difficult you know get training somewhere else go somewhere so having that opportunity while you're in high school that that's the most important thing and learning what you're good at so I'm very excited about this policy it was signed into law it passed uh the house and the Senate and and I'm really excited to once again get those skills what we call Hands-On skills back into high school so kids will one when they leave they will have a job they'll have an opportunity or they'll have a skill it establishes Trade Centers trades Education Centers five of them I think Statewide two of which have to be on the east side of the Cascades so you see those uh outreaches having benefits for your District Douglas County I think you mentioned yes absolutely so the Eastern Washington ones are directed towards the esds so our whole ESD 171 will have access so each high school has access to the curriculum which is um one of the curriculums they can choose is uh the AGC so um General Contractors uh so that's a basis that has has been approved through the state of Washington or uh apprenticeships can come in whether that's uh plumbers or pipe fitters or operators or Carpenters they

stay pretty seasonal as we get through the uh this coming week 40 and it looks like pretty much mid 40s for high temperatures I think these might be a little bit low but all in all we're going to stay pretty much in the mid to upper 40s throughout the rest of this week and that's just about where we should be for this time of year but today not where we should be for this time of year 54 our

to 10 and0 with a 3528 win coach kayin dbor was pleased about another win against a quality opponent first of all just I'm really proud of our guys um you know just tail of two halves there really just uh you know kind of a shootout the first half and then the second half uh both teams uh especially the defenses settle in I thought we did a good job still just attacking and um you know found a way to put some points in the board uh came up short with the points on that last Drive which would have certainly uh sealed it a little easier for us but uh proud of the fight proud of the way that

belief they kept fighting for it and you know but at the end of the day we're finding new ways to lose football games and that's you know ultimately on me and I'll take that ownership and ball security is everything and you know but in all three phases once again we'll see things that we didn't do we didn't execute that we can control that Cal took advantage of us and and lost a tight football game I mean th those are the reality of it there's some bright spots Leo palassi bright spot uh some of our defense at times better right but every critical moments we got to be able to execute and do what we do and take care of the ball and take advantage of some opportunities that we were given tonight that we weren't in all three phases Montana State demolished Eastern Washington

MTN news Billings police chief Rich St John says that despite a number of recent shootings here in Billings that violent crime is still on a downward trajectory in the city since the public safety mil Levy was passed in an interview with Q2 last week before the most recent shooting in chase the chief also denied accusations that police had been caught off guard when it comes to gang activity taking place in Billings he says the one thing that really jumps out at him is the youth offenders that they're dealing with and says that presents a real problem you know some of the laws that we have on the books um makes it difficult to hold uh juveniles accountable for these type of crimes you have to remember that when a lot of the juvenile laws were written it was designed for uh you know chronic runaways the Trent the shoplifter the fight after school uh now we're dealing with juvenile offenders with guns that uh have a propensity to shoot at things and people the chief says that along with the need for more jail space Billings is sorely lacking in mental health and Addiction Services he says it will ultimately be up to the public to decide what level of Public Safety they want some

face up to 6 months in prison plans for a new recycling project in Shephard are ruffling feathers so much so the state extended a public comment period for more people to weigh in the discussion centers around what's being described as a recycling repository with many now debating whether it's an asset or an eyesore mtn's Jackie coffin takes a closer look this is auto Shredder residue it's the finest material of what's broken down from cars and household appliances like washers and dryers and refrigerators a proposal on the table now from Pacific Steel and recycling is to move it from here in Lockwood to here a piece of land they own in Shepard right off of Highway 87 when looking at this land in Shephard Pacific Steel and recycling is looking ahead to the Future we're trying to you know be able to recycle more as we continue down the road and so are the ranchers who work the land next door this is Montana Prairie Land and we feel that it deserves to be protected what to do with this piece of land off of Highway 887 has sparked a fiery debate between Pacific Steel and nearby residence like the charters and it all starts here the Pacific Steel Lockwood shredding facility where things you recognize like cars and refrigerators are broken down into materials that can be recycled these and these separated out and other materials that can't be recycled at least for now coming years you know we'll have technology to be able to still get that material back out of there two years ago Pacific Steel introduced its proposal to put an ASR repository on a piece of land that it owns out by Shephard the overall land that we own those 320 Acres uh but we will only be uh using a maximum of 90 of those Acres Jason Heath with Pacific Steel says the underground pits will be covered with a synthetic liner to keep the material contained the charters worry not only what it will look like from above but what can happen below we do not know how much this would affect our health or our general welfare but we don't want to find out either Heath says Pacific Steel and recycling is working with the EQ and EPA to follow all state and federal guidelines but those who oppose the project would rather see it located closer to the dump itself we felt there's already a space right now for it in the Billings Landfill um and instead of spreading out to other areas with this just keep it where it's at as the public still has two weeks to comment on the project both sides are thinking about what's next so instead of waiting 50 years and saying this was a bad idea we we feel that it really needs to to be taken seriously right now to question if it's a a valid idea in Shephard Jackie coffin MTN [Music] news the red shaded area show where we expect warmer than average temperatures Tuesday Wednesday they could even increase by the time we get to Thursday some indications of a bit cooler air starting to come in Weak cold front that could produce some Gusty winds it

access to more routes in a quicker time it might not be ski season just yet the weather's been great for Lift building not for skiing but that didn't stop hundreds of visitors from making their way up to Red Lodge Mountain for this the grand opening of their brand new chairlift it's still hard to Fathom that it's here in Running Red Lodge Mountain GM Jeff Schmidt says the finished project is a little bit of a dream come true it's pretty cool that we pulled this off mainly in house with our crew here they did great I'm really proud of them the nearly $3 million triple chair lift replaces the old Miami Beach lift transporting skiers to the top of Palisades in around 3 minutes that's 8 to 9 minutes faster than the old lift it's getting skiers up the hill faster a huge Improvement that took months of hard work the lift comes from a ski resort in Utah and had to be taken down and reconstructed we had stuff spread everywhere lots of trucking lots of cranes but all that hard work made this moment extra special yeah the first chair headed up the mountain Monday followed by many other visitors getting their chance to test the new ride it's a tremendous Improvement for large mountain among those was 48-year season ticket holder Rick McGarvey he and I shared a chair Monday and he says the lift will add a lot to the mountain he loves it takes the load off a triple chair over here and give people quick access to lower Miami as well as the Palisades and while Schmidt has planned the entire building process there was a surprise waiting for him at today's cemon want to unveil the new name of this lift which will forever be known as the staff Express the lift's name the stash Express pays homage to the GM's legendary facial hair a nice surprise that Schmidt says might keep him away from

I LOOK BACK ON THIS EXPERIENCE WITH DEEP REMORSE. >> ELLIS TELLING PROSECUTORS SHE WAS INFORMED BY TRUMP ADVISER DAN SCAVINO THAT TRUMP NO PLANS TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE, EVEN THOUGH JOE BIDEN WAS UNMISTAKABLY THE WINNER OF THE 2020 ELECTION. >> I EMPHASIZE TO HIM, I THOUGHT THAT THE AND THE CLAIMS AND ABILITY TO CHALLENGE THE ELECTION RESULTS WAS ESSENTIALLY OVER. AND HE SAID TO ME IN A KIND OF EXCITED TONE, WHILE WE DON'T CARE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE. HE SAID WHILE THE BOSS MEANING PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE SAID THE BOSS IS NOT GOING TO LEAVE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ARE JUST GOING TO STAY IN POWER. AND I SAID, WELL, DOESN'T QUITE WORK WAY, YOU REALIZE. >> AND HE SAID, WE DON'T CARE. TRUMP HAS PLED NOT GUILTY IN THE CASE AND DENIED ALL WRONGDOING. IN A STATEMENT TO ABC, HIS ATTORNEY SAID THE QUOTE, PURPORTED CONVERSATION AS TOLD ELLIS IS, QUOTE, MEANINGLESS AND THAT THE ONLY QUOTE FACT IS THAT TRUMP DID LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE. >> TRUMP AND HIS COMPANY ARE FACING PENALTIES UP TO $250 MILLION IN A CIVIL FRAUD TRIAL. >> HE'S ALSO BEEN INDICTED IN THREE OTHER CRIMINAL CASES. ALL THREE PENDING TRIAL NEXT YEAR. >> BUT THIS IS A POLITICAL INDICTMENT, IS A BIDEN INDICTMENT IN GEORGIA. >> IT'S FULL STEAM AHEAD. FULTON COUNTY PROSECUTORS IN THEIR CASE AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT, IT IS NOW THE DUTY OF MY OFFICE TO PROVE THESE CHARGES. THE INDICTMENT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AT TRIAL. >> SIDNEY POWELL EXPLAINING A PLAN. SHE SAYS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE OVAL OFFICE AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION TO APPOINT HER SPECIAL COUNSEL. >> HE WAS SPECIFICALLY WILLING TO APPOINT A SPECIAL COUNSEL. AND THEN ABOUT THE THIRD TIME WE WENT THROUGH THAT SCENARIO. SIBLANI I THINK SAID YOU CAN NAME HER ANYTHING YOU WANT, MR. PRESIDENT. >> AND NOBODY'S GOING TO PAY A BIT OF ATTENTION TO IT. POWELL SAYS SHE BELIEVES THAT HAVE GIVEN HER THE APPARENT AUTHORITY TO HAVE VOTING MACHINES SEIZED THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE MACHINES TO BE SECURED IN FOUR OR FIVE STATES OR CITIES. AND SEE ABOUT DOING BIPARTISAN OR MILITARY OR WHATEVER. EVERYBODY AGREED REVIEW OF THE MACHINES. >> POWELL SAID, FOLLOWED UP WITH TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF THE NEXT DAY, WHO BRUSHED HER OFF? >> I CALLED MARK MEADOWS THE NEXT MORNING JUST TO RUN TO THE GROUND AND SAID, HEY, WHEN CAN I COME PICK UP MY BADGE? AND MY KEY ESSENTIALLY LEFT? >> AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GOING TO ADD UP. AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE TELLING TRUMP HE LOST. POWELL SAYS TRUMP STARTED TO RELY ON HER BECAUSE SHE STILL BELIEVED HE HAD WON. >> YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ELECTION LAW? NO. ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT HE WON NOW? YEAH. SHE SAYS SHE LEFT TOWN AHEAD OF JANUARY 6TH, FEARING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. >> I'M TOLD EVERYBODY I NEED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF D.C.. JUST SIGNED IT SO A REALLY BAD IDEA TO HAVE A RALLY OVER THE END OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL POSSE AS PART OF THEIR COOPERATION DEALS. >> POWELL AND ALICE HAVE AGREED TO TESTIFY MOVING FORWARD AS PROSECUTORS CONTINUE TO BUILD THEIR CASE. IT WAS FASCINATING TO. HEAR AND SEE THOSE TAPES. OUR THANKS TO OLIVIA FOR THAT EXCLUSIVE REPORTING. JOINING NOW FOR MORE IS ATTORNEY ANTHONY MICHAEL KREISS, WHO WAS A UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA LAW PROFESSOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. YOU'RE HEARING THESE TAPES ALONG WITH US FOR THE FIRST TIME. >> WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU MOST ? >> WELL, I THINK THE BIGGEST QUESTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN HOW YOU PROVE INTENT. WHAT WAS THE INTENT BEHIND ALL THE ELECTION RELATED LITIGATION AND THE ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION? DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE ALWAYS SAID THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT QUESTIONING THE FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE ELECTION IN A GOOD FAITH WAY. BUT THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED TODAY SUGGESTS THAT NO, THAT THE INTENT WAS JUST SIMPLY TO HOLD ON TO POWER AS IS ALLEGED BY FANI WILLIS IN THE INDICTMENT HERE IN ATLANTA. IN THESE RECORDINGS, JENNA ELLIS SAYS THAT TRUMP'S ADVISER, DAN SCAVINO, TRUMP HAD NO PLANS TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE, EVEN WHEN ELLIS SAID THAT HE TOLD HIM THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE ELECTION RESULTS WAS ESSENTIALLY. POWELL ALSO DETAILED THE TIMES THAT TRUMP WAS TOLD HE HAD LOST . >> IN YOUR VIEW, DOES THAT FULLY UNDERMINE WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS MAINTAINED ? >> HE REALLY BELIEVED THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN? YEAH, IT CERTAINLY SUGGESTS THAT AT A MINIMUM IS A WILLFUL IGNORANCE ABOUT WHAT THE REALITY WAS ON THE GROUND, WHICH WE WHICH WE KNOW FROM OTHER PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED, PARTICULARLY THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN SECRETARY OF STATE BRAD RAFFENSPERGER AND DONALD, WHERE THERE WAS JUST AN UNWILLINGNESS TO PAY ATTENTION TO FACTS AND FIGURES AS RELAYED BY OFFICIALS. SO I THINK THERE'S A CONSISTENT PATTERN OF WANTING TO HEAR CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT WANTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO EVIDENCE WHEN IT WENT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND THIS WAS ALL IN PURSUIT OF MAINTAINING POWER. AND UNLAWFULLY RELEASED, ALLEGEDLY UNLAWFULLY OVERTURNING AND ATTEMPTING TO OVERTURN ELECTION. >> WHERE DO PROSECUTORS GO FROM HERE? WELL, IN ANY BIG CONSPIRACY CASE OR RACKETEERING CASE LIKE THIS, PROSECUTORS WANT TO BUILD A CASE BY WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE CHAIN, FLIPPING WITNESSES, SECURING DEALS AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW, THERE'S THERE'S CREDIBLE WITNESSES ARE ABLE TO TESTIFY AND PROVIDE VERY IMPORTANT, PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE TO A JURY. AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THEY'RE WORKING THEIR WAY UP. ULTIMATELY, THEY WANT TO CALL AS MANY DEFENDANTS AS THEY CAN . THERE ARE MANY DEFENDANTS STILL LEFT BEFORE THEY TAKE THIS TO TRIAL. AND SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT PROCESS PLAY OUT NOW. ANTHONY MICHAEL KREISS, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >> THANK YOU. TONIGHT, WE'RE GETTING A RARE LOOK AT ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS. ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES ARE NOW SURROUNDING GAZA CITY AND MOVING IN. DRAMATIC IMAGES SHOW MANY HOMES ,BUSINESSES EITHER HEAVILY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. SIDE ROADS CAN BE SEEN LITTERED WITH CRUSHED CARS AND MANGLED METAL. FIGHTING IS ALSO INTENSIFYING NEAR THE AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN GAZA. THE SITUATION THERE ARE GETTING MORE DIRE BY THE DAY. PREMATURE BABIES ARE AMONG THE MOST AT RISK. DOCTORS SAY MANY ARE NOW BEING TAKEN OFF INCUBATORS BECAUSE OF POWER OUTAGES. OUR CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT MATT IS IN ISRAEL. >> WE MOUNTED UP ON THOSE JEEPS AND DROVE INTO GAZA. THE ROAD GROUND INTO DUST. AND EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY OF A MILLION PEOPLE WHOSE APOCALYPTIC SCENES BLOWN OUT BUILDINGS EVERYWHERE. IN NORTHERN GAZA, WE WERE EMBEDDED THE ISRAELI MILITARY, TO SEE THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, THEY SAY, WAS USED AS A HAMAS COMMAND CENTER. THE ROAD LEADING PAST WHAT HAD BEEN A LUXURY, NOW CHARRED BLACK. MUCH OF IT COLLAPSED IN THE BILLOWING DUST. >> SCORES OF SOLDIERS ON FOOT. THEN LOAD INTO THESE ARMORED FIGHTING VEHICLES. WE'RE NOW INSIDE THIS ARMORED FIGHTING VEHICLE. AND WE ARE GOING TOWARDS THE RED SPECIALIZED CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL THAT HAS BEEN EVACUATED. WE ARE NOW RIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL INTO ACTIVE FIGHTING. AND WHILE WE MEET, ISRAEL'S CHIEF MILITARY SPOKESMAN, DANIEL MCGORRY, A FORMER COMMANDER, YOU CAN HEAR THE TANK FIRING DOWN THE STREET. HAGAR SAYS THIS WAS THE HOUSE OF A HAMAS COMMANDER. IT WAS NEXT TO A SCHOOL AND THE RITZY HOSPITAL JUST UP THE STREET. >> THOSE TANKS FIRING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ALL THAT SMALL ARMS IN THE BACKGROUND, BUT WE HAD TO GET DOWN. NOW WE HEAR THE WHISTLES FROM THE SMALL ARMS FIRE AROUND US. WHEN YOU HEAR THE WHISTLE, IN ADDITION TO THE CRACK, IT MEANS IT'S VERY CLOSE. WE'RE USING THE TANK AS COVER RIGHT NOW. >> AND TONIGHT, WITH THE WORLD NOW AWARE OF THE HORRORS AT, AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY, THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYING HAMAS IS OPERATING A COMMAND CENTER BENEATH THAT HOSPITAL, TOO. TWO BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY THE U.S. HAS INTELLIGENCE SUPPORTING ISRAEL'S CLAIM. DOCTORS DENY THAT AND SAY THE HOSPITAL IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING AND WITHOUT FUEL FOR THE GENERATORS THEY TO REMOVE 39 PREMATURE BABIES FROM THEIR INCUBATORS, LINING THOSE TINY BUNDLES ON A GURNEY, DESPERATELY TRYING TO KEEP WARM AND ALIVE. >> THREE OF THE BABIES HAVE DIED. >> AND BACK HERE AT RANTISSI HOSPITAL, HAGAR LEADING US INSIDE THROUGH A HOLE MADE BY AN ARTILLERY SHELL. >> THIS WAS THE ARMORY. OKAY. HAGAR SAYS THIS CHILDREN'S ROOM WAS USED AS A HAMAS COMMAND CENTER. >> THERE WAS AK-47 TO LOOK PRETTY OLD AND RUSTY. I MEAN, IT WAS THIS A CRACK THAT WAS HERE? >> NO, NO. SOME OF THE GEAR, IT WAS THE OPERATION AND THE GEAR. BUT YOU ALSO SOME OF THE TERRORISTS LED THE WAY. DID NOT STAY HERE. IT SHOWS US THE WAR MACHINE HAMAS IS CONDUCTING FROM A HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN. >> FURTHER INTO T BASEMENT, A SEPARATE SECTION. WE SEE THE CHAIR, A GALLERY REVEALING THAT CHAIR. >> AND WE PRESSED THE ISRAELI MILITARY BEYOND WHAT THEY'RE SEEING HERE. ARE THEY CERTAIN HOSTAGES WERE HELD? >> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT THIS WAS A SPOT WHERE SOMEBODY WAS HELD HOSTAGE? >> WE'RE GOING TO BRING HERE A FORENSIC TEAM. THE ONLY REASON I BROUGHT YOU HERE AND I'M TAKING A HUGE RISK BECAUSE YOU SEE THE FIGHTING OUTSIDE, TAKING HOSTAGES ON A CHAIR IN THIS FACILITY IN A BASEMENT FIGHTING FOR A HOSPITAL. YOU THINK THE CHILDREN HERE IN THIS HOSPITAL, A HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN, IS A HUMAN SHIELD. >> THIS IS HAMAS. THE IDF OFTEN TALKS ABOUT THAT IDEA OF THEM BEING HUMAN SHIELDS. MATT GUTMAN JOINS NOW FROM ISRAEL. MATT, YOU GOT A UNIQUE LOOK DEEP INSIDE GAZA TONIGHT. WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU MOST THERE ON THE GROUND, LINSEY? WE WERE TOLD THAT NO OTHER JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN THIS FAR INTO GAZA CITY AND YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION AND THE FIRST THING THAT POPS INTO MY MIND IS THE SCALE OF DESTRUCTION. 23 YEARS OF COVERING LOTS OF CONFLICTS. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING IT. VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE BUILDING ON THAT DRIVE INTO GAZA AND AROUND GAZA CITY WAS EITHER COMPLETELY DESTROYED OR SEVERELY. AND THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THAT TRULY STOOD OUT JUST ABOUT THAT DRIVE WE HAVEN'T SEEN AND DID NOT SEE A SINGLE CIVILIAN ANYWHERE, NOBODY MOVING AROUND OTHER THAN ISRAELI TROOPS, OBVIOUSLY INSIDE HOSPITAL. THE SCENE VERY DISTURBING, BUT WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHETHER THE CHARACTERIZATION OF HOSTAGES BEING HELD THERE IS. THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S STILL WORKING THAT OUT. IT IS GOING GET FORENSICS TEAMS THERE TO CHECK THE DNA ON THOSE PERSONAL THAT WE SAW INSIDE THERE NANCY. MATT GUTMAN FOR US, TEL AVIV. >> ONCE AGAIN, MATT, OUR THANKS TO YOU AS ALWAYS. LET'S BRING IN WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SPOKESPERSON, DR. MARGARET HARRIS. DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. TELL US, IF YOU WOULD, ABOUT THE SITUATION FACING THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE RIGHT, SPECIFICALLY PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS THERE. >> WELL, HOSPITAL SYSTEM, AS DR. TEDROS, OUR DIRECTOR GENERAL SAID, IS REALLY ON ITS KNEES. >> MOST HOSPITALS HAVE CLOSED. WE'VE GOT 60% AT LEAST NOT, YOU KNOW, CLOSED THEIR DOORS, NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION. ALL OF THE 15 REMAINING HOSPITALS ARE UNDER MASSIVE STRAIN. THEY CAN ONLY PROVIDE REALLY LIMITED EMERGENCY SERVICES. THEY'VE GOT SHORTAGES OF WATER, FOOD AND OF COURSE, FUEL. AND THEY ARE TRYING ALSO TO LOOK AFTER THE HUGE NUMBERS OF DISPLACED PEOPLE SHELTERING IN THEM AND THE VAST OF THE POPULATION NOW BEING DISPLACED DOWN TO THE SOUTH WHERE THERE'S ONLY ONE THIRD OF THE HOSPITAL CAPACITY OF THE WHOLE AREA OF GAZA. SO HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING DOWN, HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WITH NEEDS FROM INJURIES, BUT ALSO FROM THE CHRONIC ILLNESSES OR WOMEN NEED TO GIVE BIRTH AND HARDLY ANY CAPACITY TO HAVE THAT. AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE'VE ALSO GOT ATTACKS ON AND IN THE CLOSE VICINITY OF RUNNING HOSPITALS IN THE NORTH, KILLING AND PREVENTING SAFE ACCESS FOR THE HEALTH STAFF, THE INJURED AND FOR THE PATIENTS. I COULD GO ON. IT'S THE IT'S A IT'S THE MOST GRIM THING I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE CAREER. >> THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT THE IDF HAS SAID THEY WOULD GO INTO THE HOSPITALS IN SOME OF THE CASES AND GET THE MOST VULNERABLE AND, TAKE THEM TO HOSPITALS ELSEWHERE. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT THAT IS HAPPENING OR IS IN THE WORKS AND WE HAVE NOT. BUT REMEMBER, THE MOST VULNERABLE TINY BABIES, PREMATURE BABIES, WHO NEED ADVANCED SUPPORT AND SPECIALIST SUPPORT TO SURVIVE. AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL THAT'S NOW FALLING APART AND ON THE INTENSE WITH INTENSE FIGHTING AROUND IT. MANY STRIKES AND A LOT OF DAMAGE. IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE THAT COULD LOOK THOSE BABIES AND THEY CAN'T LOOK AFTER THOSE BABIES. SO WHERE THEY GOING TO GO? WHAT KIND OF SUPPLIES ARE MOST IN NEED THIS POINT? BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD JUST FROM SOME OF YOUR EXAMPLES FROM REPORTING JUST ABOUT HOW DIRE AND LIMITED THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND ELECTRICITY ARE AT THIS POINT. >> OF COURSE, THEY NEED FUEL FOR THE GENERATORS JUST TO KEEP THE ELECTRICITY GOING, TO KEEP ALL THE MACHINERY GOING, TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO OPERATE ON SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT TERRIBLE INJURIES, YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AT THE MOMENT, YOU'VE SEEN THE PICTURES OF SURGEONS. IT'S HEROIC STUFF. IT'S ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO BE TRYING TO OPERATE VIA LIGHTS FROM YOUR PHONE. CLEAN WATER, FOR INSTANCE, AL-SHIFA, THE WATER TANKS ON THEIR ROOF WERE DESTROYED. THEY'VE GOT NO CLEAN WATER. HOW CAN YOU KEEP INFECTION THROUGH ANY KIND OF INFECTION PREVENTION? YOU KNOW, HOW CAN YOU KEEP WOUNDS CLEAN IF YOU DON'T HAVE CLEAN WATER? HOW CAN YOU EVEN CLEAN OUT ALL THE AWFUL INJURIES THAT AND HOW CAN YOU PREVENT INFECTION? AND, OF COURSE, FOOD. REMEMBER AGAIN, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE SHELTERING IN THESE HOSPITALS AND THEY'RE STARVING. SO VERY BASIC THINGS ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED. AND, DR. HARRIS, YOU'VE SAID IN PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS THIS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS DOESN'T COMPARE TO ANYTHING. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS RESPONDED BEFORE. >> TALKED ABOUT WHY THAT IS. WELL, WE'VE NEVER SEEN SITUATION WHERE HOSPITALS ARE UNABLE TO FUNCTION. WE'VE ALSO NEVER SEEN SO MANY ATTACKS ON HOSPITALS. WE HAVE DOCUMENTED MORE THAN 130 IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. WE'VE NOT THAT NUMBER EVEN IN OTHER PLACES WHERE WE HAVE SEEN HORRIFIC NUMBERS OF ATTACKS ON HOSPITALS SUCH AS IN. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BEEN OF THIS ORDER. >> WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SPOKESPERSON DR. MARGARET HARRIS, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHT AND YOUR TIME . THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOSTING ME. >> WE TURN NOW TO THE LATEST ON THE DEATHS OF FIVE ELITE AMERICAN SOLDIERS KILLED ABOARD A SPECIAL OPERATIONS HELICOPTER IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. ALL FIVE SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED. >> HERE'S OUR CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANCHOR, MARTHA RADDATZ ,TONIGHT. THE NAMES, THE IMAGES OF THE FIVE ELITE SOLDIERS KILLED DURING THAT NIGHTTIME REFUELING EXERCISE NOW RELEASED BY THE PENTAGON. THE FIVE SOLDIERS WERE ABOARD A SPECIAL OPERATIONS AVIATION HELICOPTER IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA. THE KIND OF HELICOPTER, WHICH OFTEN FLIES THE ARMY'S DELTA FORCE AND THE NAVY SEAL TEAM SIX. TWO SECRET MISSIONS MIDAIR. REFUELING IS DIFFICULT IN THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS WAS MADE FAR MORE CHALLENGING. WEARING NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR YET WHAT WENT WRONG. THE SOLDIERS BASED FORT CAMPBELL CAME FROM ACROSS AMERICA. CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER STEPHEN DWYER OF TENNESSEE. CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER SHANE BARNES FROM SACRAMENTO. STAFF SERGEANT TANNER GROWN FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. SERGEANT STUTTGART, ARIZONA. AND SERGEANT CADE WOLF FROM MINNESOTA. >> THE ELITE FORCES WERE DEPLOYED THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN IN CASE THEY WERE NEEDED TO EVACUATE AMERICANS FROM ISRAEL OR ELSEWHERE IN THE VOLATILE REGION. >> MARTHA RADDATZ JOINS US NOW. MARTHA, THE U.S. ALSO CONDUCTED AIRSTRIKES LAST NIGHT IN SYRIA AGAINST IRAN BACKED MILITIAS THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETING U.S. FORCES. >> WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT THOSE STRIKES ACCOMPLISHED? LINSEY THOSE AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE ROUGHLY HALF A DOZEN IRAN LINKED MILITANTS, ACCORDING A DEFENSE OFFICIAL. BUT THE ROCKET AND DRONE ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICAN FORCES IN THE REGION HAVE NOT LET UP. DESPITE THE RETALIATORY STRIKES, LINSEY. MARTHA RADDATZ FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, THANKS SO MUCH, MARTHA. >> THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION TONIGHT INTO WHY SECRET SERVICE AGENT FIRED A WEAPON OUTSIDE THE GEORGETOWN HOME OF PRESIDENT GRANDDAUGHTER NAOMI. OFFICIALS SAY THREE PEOPLE WERE SPOTTED TRYING BREAK INTO A SECRET SERVICE VEHICLE. HERE'S OUR CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT, PIERRE TONIGHT IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL. >> A SEARCH SUSPECTS AFTER A SECRET SERVICE AGENT PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT'S ELDEST OPENED FIRE. THE SECRET SERVICE RESPONDING TO THREE MEN TRYING TO BREAK INTO ONE OF THEIR SECRET SERVICE VEHICLES OUTSIDE OF NAOMI BIDEN'S HOME IN GEORGETOWN. THESE GOT AWAY IN A RED VEHICLE. NO ONE APPARENTLY INJURED. THE BRAZEN ATTEMPT HAPPENING AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A CITY SEEING A SURGE IN VIOLENT LIKE THIS, ARMED ROBBERY CAUGHT ON CAMERA LESS THAN A MONTH AND A SPIKE IN CAR THEFT. POLICE SAY IS FUELED IN PART JUVENILES. >> WE HAVE TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED IN VIOLENT ACTIVITY IN OUR CITY. >> THE MAYOR FOCUSING ON JUVENILES. CAR THEFT IS UP A STUNNING 98% IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL WITH 141 JUVENILES ARRESTED FOR CARJACKINGS, A THIRD OF ALL CARJACKING ARRESTS. THE INCIDENT AT THE HOME, NAOMI BIDEN, WHO GOT MARRIED AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST YEAR. IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT IN D.C. RIGHT NOW, NO ONE IS IMMUNE FROM CRIME. >> LUCKILY, THE WHITE HOUSE HAD COMMENT ON THIS INCIDENT AND SO FAR NO INDICATION THAT THE WOULD BE THIEVES KNEW WHOSE CAR OR HOME THEY WERE TARGETING. LIZZIE. >> PIERRE, THANK YOU. GOVERNMENT FUNDING IS SAID TO RUN OUT FRIDAY NIGHT MAKING THIS LOOMING SHUTDOWN THE FIRST REAL TEST FOR NEW HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON. HE IS PITCHING AN UNCONVENTIONAL TWO PART PLAN. IT WOULD KEEP CERTAIN PARTS THE GOVERNMENT, LIKE VETERANS AFFAIRS, HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION, FUNDED THROUGH JANUARY AND OTHER PARTS LIKE DEFENSE AND HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING THROUGH FEBRUARY SECOND. JOHNSON CAN ONLY AFFORD TO LOSE THREE REPUBLICANS. ALREADY, AT LEAST NINE SAY THEY'LL VOTE AGAINST IT. THE SUPREME COURT HAS ADOPTED A NEW CODE OF CONDUCT AFTER REVELATIONS OF UNDISCLOSED TRAVEL AND OTHER GIFTS. IN A STATEMENT, THE NINE JUSTICES SAY THE NEW CODE IS, FOR THE MOST PART, COMMON LAW ETHICS RULES. BUT COMPLIANCE REMAINS LARGELY UP TO THE JUSTICES THEMSELVES. CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SAYS THE COURT WILL REVIEW WHETHER OTHER STEPS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE RULES ARE FOLLOWED. THERE'S A STATE OF EMERGENCY ICELAND TONIGHT AMID FEARS OF A DEVASTATING VOLCANIC ERUPTION AND THREATS AVIATION. 1200 QUAKES HIT IN THE PAST 24 HOURS ALONE. MAGMA SPREADING UNDERGROUND ERUPT AT ANY MOMENT. A FISHING VILLAGE 30 MILES FROM THE CAPITAL IS NOW A TOWN. EVACUATED RESIDENTS SAY THEY'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED TREMORS THIS BEFORE. >> AND WE STILL HAVE MUCH MORE TO GET TO TONIGHT ON TIME. THE AND RUN INVOLVING AN NBA PLAYER IN PHILADELPHIA.

WHAT WOULD YOU MARATHON 2 TO 6 EASTERN EVERY SATURDAY ON ABC'S NEWS LIVE. >> I MEAN RIGHT NOW. WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. CORRUPTION CERTAINLY COMES IN ALL FORMS. WE'VE SEEN SHADES OF ALLEGED CORRUPTION WITH WHAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OWN LAWYERS ACCUSE HIM OF DOING TO TRY TO HOLD ON TO POWER IN 2020 AND THE THREATS TO DEMOCRACY NATIONWIDE. AND WHILE THOSE EXTREME MOMENTS OF SUBVERSION HAVE TAKEN THE MAJORITY OF THE, THERE ARE ALSO SMALLER DAILY DOSES OF CORRUPTION THAT COULD OUR POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE LONG RUN. THAT INCLUDES ON CAPITOL, WHERE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE LONG FACED ACCUSATIONS OF TRADING ON CLOSED DOOR INFORMATION. IN TONIGHT'S PRIME FOCUS, ABC JAY O'BRIEN INTRODUCES US TO A NEW GENERATION OF ONLINE DETECTIVES TRACKING EXPOSING THOSE LAWMAKERS TRADES FOR THE WORLD TO SEE AND PUSHING CHANGE. SUNNY SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA SEEMINGLY A WORLD AWAY FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. IT'S WHERE WE FOUND CHRIS JOSEPHS AND HIS MORNING ROUTINE. >> EVERY DAY CHRIS WAKES UP MAKES A CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN ALONGSIDE FELLOW INTERNET'S SLEUTHS, SIFTS THROUGH THE STOCK TRADES. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MAKE. >> IT ALL STARTED OFF AS INFURIATING BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, WHAT THE HOW ARE THEY ALLOWED TO DO IT WHEN OTHER AMERICANS CAN'T? >> AS LONG AS A TRADE IS REPORTED BEFORE, 45 DAYS, THERE'S NO LAW PREVENTING MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OR SENATE FROM TRADING STOCKS, EVEN IF THE BILLS THEY PASS, COMMITTEES THEY SIT ON COULD INFLUENCE A COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE. >> OUTRAGED AT FIRST, CHRIS THEN SAW OPPORTUNITY TO GET IN ON THE ACTION. HE MOVED OUT WEST AND THREE FRIENDS LAUNCHED THE APP AUTOPILOT. IT LETS USERS FOLLOW A POLITICIAN'S TRADES AND THEN COPY THEM AUTOMATICALLY BUYING OR SELLING THE SAME STOCK. A LAWMAKER DOES AT WHATEVER DOLLAR AMOUNT THEY LIKE. >> THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS. >> THE REASON WHY WE INITIALLY SET OUT WITH THE POLITICIANS IS BECAUSE THEY WERE KILLING IT. THEY KILLING. >> THEY WERE KILLING IT. THEY WERE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN ON THE MONEY? >> I'M TRYING TO GET IN ON THE MONEY. YEP. AT WHAT POINT DOES THIS ILLEGAL? THE COMPANY NOW HAS USERS DEDICATING TENS OF MILLIONS TRYING TO GROW THEIR OWN BANK ACCOUNTS BY MIMICKING LAWMAKERS MARKET MOVES. >> BUT THE APP HAS ALSO BECOME A RALLYING FOR A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORS, POINTING OUT WHAT THEY SAY IS A RIGGED SYSTEM THAT LETS A GROUP OF 535 MEN AND WOMEN WITH SERIOUS POLITICAL INFLUENCE BUY AND SELL STOCKS IN THE FIRST PLACE LEGALLY. LAWMAKERS CAN'T TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION, MEANING DETAILS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. BUT A HYPOTHETICAL SENATOR COULD VOTE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND THEN BUY STOCK IN A COMPANY THAT WAS PUBLICLY A PROJECT TO BUILD A BRIDGE IN THEIR DISTRICT. THEY COULD SIT ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AND TRADE IN THE STOCK OF A DEFENSE CONTRACTOR RECEIVING A SIZABLE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT, POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS THAT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, THOUSANDS ONLINE BEGAN RELISHING POINTING OUT WE'RE ALL LEGAL. >> THIS IS A RED FLAG. AND THE BIGGEST DOING THAT ISN'T A NAME AT ALL, OR EVEN A FACE. >> WHAT SHOULD WE CALL YOU? WHAT DO YOU GO BY? YOU'RE WELCOME TO CALL ME WALES. MR. WALES, A FINANCE GUY WHO STARTED PORING OVER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TRADES WHEN HE WAS BORED DURING THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. HE GOES BY THE FULL MONIKER UNUSUAL WALES AND ASKS THAT WE NOT USE HIS REAL NAME OR SHOW FACE. FEARFUL OF BLOWBACK FROM THE POLITICIANS WHOSE TRADES HE DISSECTS AND NOW PUBLISHES ON HIS WEBSITE AND ON POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS, TRACK CONGRESS MEMBERS TRACE AN UNUSUAL WALES ICON, A WHALE BEING ANOTHER TERM FOR A BIG INVESTOR. >> UNUSUAL BECAUSE OF THE STRANGE SUCCESS OF THE TRADERS. HE TRACKS WALES'S DATA FINDS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. HIS STOCK PORTFOLIOS CONSISTENTLY BEAT THE S&P500. >> ONE THING PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY IS THAT THAT NUMBERS ARE VERY GOOD AT PICKING STOCKS OFTEN SEEN. BUT TO BE QUITE FRANK IS THAT NUMBERS ARE ALSO QUITE GOOD AT AVOIDING LOSSES. >> ONE EXAMPLE WALES POINTED US TO WAS THE COLLAPSE OF SILICON VALLEY BANK AND THE REGIONAL BANKING THAT SOME LAWMAKERS ON KEY CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES THAT GOVERN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM DUMPED SVB AND OTHER BANK STOCKS DURING THE TURMOIL MANY BEFORE PRICE PLUMMETED. >> NOT ILLEGAL, WALES SAYS, BUT EYEBROW RAISING. >> I WOULD SAY THERE'S NOT AS MUCH TRANSPARENCY AS ONE WOULD BELIEVE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MANY OF THESE MEMBERS SIT ON COMMITTEES THAT HAVE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OVER MANY OF THESE COMPANIES AND THOSE NEW CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY HAVE SPURRED SOME IN CONGRESS TO TRY AGAIN TO BAN THEIR COLLEAGUES FROM TRADING STOCKS ALTOGETHER, A POLITICAL MOVEMENT THAT'S MADE FOR SOME UNUSUAL ALLIANCES ,LIKE A BILL CO-SPONSORED BY FAR RIGHT FIREBRAND MATT GAETZ AND PROGRESSIVE CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ. >> WE HAVE ACCESS TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND TO THINK THAT A PERSON COULD THEN PURCHASE INDIVIDUAL STOCK AND MAKE BETS AND TRADES AND PERSONALLY BENEFIT FROM THAT IS, I THINK, IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE, THE SPIRIT OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT WE'RE HERE TO DO. AND THEN THERE'S THE DUO FROM COLORADO, REPUBLICAN KEN BUCK. >> AND DEMOCRAT JOE NEGUSE, WHO SIGNED A LETTER WITH 19 OTHER REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS PUSHING CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT STOCK TRADING. >> WHY BAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM TRADING STOCKS? >> BECAUSE APPEARS TO BE UNETHICAL AND IT IS WRONG AND AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW IT'S WRONG. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT MEMBERS CONGRESS TO BE SERVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND NOT THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS. >> SEVERAL LAWMAKERS WE SPOKE WITH DECLINED TO GO ON CAMERA, SAID THEIR TRADES ARE HANDLED FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND MADE OFTEN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND. OTHERS SAID THAT TRADING STOCKS SHOULDN'T BE BANNED BECAUSE DOING SO WOULD OFF A FINANCIAL SOURCE THAT SOME POLITICIANS USE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES? STOP WHINING. YOU KNOW, WE SIGNED UP FOR THIS JOB. WE KNEW WHAT THE PAY WAS. IT ISN'T A WE'RE GOING TO PAY YOU THIS MUCH. PLUS. CORRUPTION IS WHAT CONGRESS FIRST TRIED TO TACKLE TEN YEARS AGO, PASSING THE STOCK THAT WAS THE LAW THAT OFFICIALLY BANNED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM WITH NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. BUT THERE ARE STILL ACCUSATIONS SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DO EXACTLY THAT. HAVE YOU BOTH BECOME AWARE OF COLLEAGUES YOURS, THAT ARE BENDING THE RULES WITH, THEIR TRADES? >> LOOK, I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS BIPARTISAN. I AM NOT GOING TO GO INTO SOME NAMES. WE BOTH KNOW THE NAMES OF SOME THAT HAVE MADE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF OF TRADING SPOUSES, TRADING STOCKS WHILE COMMITTING ARE GOING ON. >> ONE PROMINENT LAWMAKER WHOSE FINANCES ARE CONSISTENTLY UNDER A MICROSCOPE IS FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI, WHO'S DISCLOSED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PROFIT FROM TRADES OVER THE YEARS, MANY MADE BY HUSBAND, A FINANCIER. >> NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THIS REALLY ALL BEGAN . THE FAMOUS PELOSI TRACK AND A POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT CALLED THE PELOSI STOCK TRACKER NOW POSTS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS THE TRADES THE FORMER SPEAKER DISCLOSES BEHIND THE SCENES IT'S RUN BY CHRIS JOSEPHS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MARKET HIS APP AUTOPILOT. >> IT ALL STARTED TWO YEARS AGO WHEN CHRIS HIS FRIENDS PUT $20,000 IN A PORTFOLIO DESIGNED TO MATCH EVERY TRADE. >> PELOSI DISCLOSED ADD THAT PORTFOLIO DO PRETTY WELL. >> NOW CHRIS SAYS HAS $10 MILLION OF USER MONEY DEDICATED TO JUST FOLLOWING THE TRADES, THE FORMER SPEAKER REPORTS. >> IT SEEMS LIKE PROVING IT IS THE HARDEST THING, PROVING WHETHER THEY'RE TRADING OFF PUBLIC OR NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. >> YES, BUT DOES IT MATTER? THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION. >> DOES IT MATTER? SHOULD THEY BE DOING ANYTHING THEY SHOULDN'T BE TRADING IN THE FIRST PLACE? IN STATEMENT, PELOSI'S OFFICE TOLD US SHE DOES NOT OWN ANY STOCKS HERSELF AND HAS NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OR SUBSEQUENT INVOLVEMENT IN ANY MADE BY HER HUSBAND. A SPOKESPERSON ADDED SHE, WAS FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF AN ATTEMPT BY CONGRESS IN 2022 TO ADDRESS MEMBERS STOCK TRADING EFFORTS DESPITE PUBLIC PRESSURE FAILED. FAST TO 2023 AND A SLATE OF SIMILAR BILLS ARE SEEKING SAME RESISTANCE. >> IT HAS TAKEN LONGER THAN WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE LIKED, BUT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD. MORE AND MORE MEMBERS HAVE JOINED IN THIS EFFORT. THEN PERHAPS EVER BEFORE. >> THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE BILLS OUT THERE WITH REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND EACH ONE OF THEM, THEY'VE GOT TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER. >> THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE BILLS OUT THERE, BUT NONE OF THEM ARE GOING ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE ALL STUCK IN VARIOUS COMMITTEES. >> RIGHT. WELCOME, CONGRESS. >> BUT FAR AWAY FROM CAPITOL HILL. IF YOU LISTEN TO UNUSUAL WALES OR CHRIS JOSEPHS. NO ONE IS QUITE SURE. YOUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WILL VOLUNTARILY CUT THEMSELVES OFF FROM A PAYDAY. I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BAN IT. I THINK IT'S ALL A SMOKESCREEN . I GENUINELY DON'T THINK THEY'LL DO IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T THEM. YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S TOO MUCH MONEY ON THE TABLE TO GIVE IT UP? I THINK IT'S JUST WILD TO SAY. >> BUT YEAH, CERTAINLY I OPENING OUR THANKS TO JAY O'BRIEN FOR THAT. >> STILL MUCH MORE TO GET TO TONIGHT, PRIME COMING UP. >> IT'S BEEN MORE THAN THREE DECADES SINCE A LITTLE GIRL WAS ENCASED IN CONCRETE IN A TV CABINET IN GEORGIA. THE MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH AND ONE OF THE STATE'S LONGEST UNSOLVED MURDER CASES. BUT NEXT IS PART OF OUR NETWORK WIDE SERIES, THE AMERICAN CLASSROOM. WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATE OF K-THROUGH-12 EDUCATION, INCLUDING THE LATEST TEACHER SHORTAGES.

BEATS HIMSELF. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AND FOR HAVING ME. THANK FOR HAVING ME. EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FOR YOUR MUSIC. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANTED TO CREATE AND STAR IN A SHOW CENTERED AROUND CAR CULTURE? OH, WELL, GROWING UP IN THE BRONX, I WAS. I WAS INTO CARS, SEEING CARS GO BY. THAT'S MY CAR. THIS. MY CAR. AND THEN LATER, I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD A NISSAN 320 TURBO FOR ABOUT $6,000. AND MY FOR CARS STARTED THEN. AND THEN I STARTED COLLECTING DOING CAR SHOWS AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO DRIVE WITH ONYX COLLECTIVE, HULU, DISNEY AND I SAID I WANTED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE NOT ONLY ON ESTHETICS OF THE CARS, BUT THE CULTURE, THE COMMUNITY, THE AND I ALSO WANTED TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO TRAVEL. AND YOU SAY FAMILY. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO BRING YOUR SON ALONG? WE WERE LOOKING FOR A CO-HOST, BUT I WAS LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S NO BETTER CO-HOST THAN MY SON ISAIAH, WHO I CAN TAKE ON THIS JOURNEY WITH ME. SO A FATHER AND SON COMPONENT THAT YOU DON'T REALLY SEE IN OUR CULTURE. AND I PUT SOME GOOD VIBES OUT THERE. YOUR FAVORITE CAR, THE LAFERRARI. >> REAL. OKAY, SO YOU JUST HAD ONE. YOU WERE LIMITED. DO YOU HAVE IT? DO YOU OWN IT? YOU OWN IT. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. >> AND SO YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT CULTURES, DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TALK ABOUT CARS. >> WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK? IT'S IMPORTANT, ME, THAT NAS UNDERSTANDS OUR COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE, TRANSFORM MY WITH THE DRIVE WE HAVE IN COMMON. I COME FROM LESS MEANS AND WE'RE MAD TODAY BECAUSE I LEARNED HOW TO WORK WITH WHAT I HAVE. AND THESE. >> THEY WORK AND WORK WITH THEIR HANDS. TALK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THAT YOU'VE HAD AS FAR AS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER THROUGH CARS. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS A CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW, CARS ARE THE CANDY. BUT, YOU KNOW, I REALIZED THAT THE REASON WHY THESE THESE AMAZING PEOPLE START CLUBS IS BECAUSE THEY WANT FAMILY AND, YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD GO FOR A $100 TROPHY. THEY TAKE ALL THIS TIME JUST TO GET 100,000 CHILDREN AND REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TROPHY. IT'S ABOUT THEM COMING TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY, WORKING, SAYING WHEN THE TROPHY IS THE SYMBOL OF THAT PROJECT. AND THEN BECAUSE ALL I'M GOING TO DO IS GO START A WHOLE NOTHER PROJECT. AND THEY FIGURED OUT A WAY TO COME IN AND ADD TO EACH OTHER TO COMMUNICATE, TO ADD FAMILY INTO IT. AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL CAR. THAT'S THE END OF THE RESULT. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS AMAZING. BUT NOW YOU CAN DO IT, RIGHT? TO DO IT? YES. ANY WITHOUT ANY SPOILERS, COULD YOU GIVE US ANY OF THE KIND OF TWISTS AND TURNS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO IN THIS SEASON EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED? >> SO FOR FOR A SIMPLE EXAMPLE, WE SHOT IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT WE WERE GOING TO SHOW YOU. WE DIDN'T SHOW YOU LOWRIDERS. WE SHOWED YOU THE HOT RIDE COMMUNITY. >> BUT THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY TO JAPAN AND SHOWED YOU LOWRIDERS. WHERE YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT LOWRIDERS. SO WE WANTED TO FLIP THE SHOW UP AND PEOPLE A DISCOVERY AND EDUCATION THAT THEY MIGHT NOT KNOWN ABOUT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, OKAY, YOU GOING TO L.A. IS GOING TO BE LOWRIDERS. >> NO, IT'S NOT SWISS CHEESE. WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. YOU REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WANT OUR VIEWERS TO KNOW THAT DRIVE WITH SWISS SPEEDS PREMIERES THURSDAY ON HULU. >> ACTION TIME. >> RONNING HAS A RICH ROLE IN NATIVE HISTORY CONNECTED TO PRAYER, SPIRITUALITY AND FINDING PEACE WITHIN YOURSELF. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE SPORT GIVES TO VERNA VOELKER OF THE NAVAJO NATION, WHO FOUNDED THE RUNNING GROUP NATIVE WOMEN RUNNING A WAY TO LIFT UP FELLOW ATHLETES. I MET WITH VERNA JUST BEFORE SHE RAN HER VERY FIRST NEW YORK CITY MARATHON TO TALK ABOUT RUNNING, HEALING AND, EVERYTHING ELSE IN BETWEEN. >> A LOT OF OUR ORIGIN STORY IS TALK ABOUT RUNNING AND ESPECIALLY LIKE WITH THE NAVAJO PEOPLE. ONE OF OUR STORIES IS WHEN WE WAKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING, WAKE UP TO GREET THE SUN. >> TRUE TO FORM, VERNA VOELKER, A MEMBER OF THE NAVAJO NATION, ROSE WITH THE SUN. THE MORNING OF THE NEW YORK MARATHON FOR THE HOKA AMBASSADOR AND ULTRAMARATHON, THIS PARTICULAR 26.2 MILE RUN WAS SPECIAL. >> SO WHAT MAKES THIS ONE DIFFERENT? I'M RUNNING, BUT I'M ALSO BRINGING ALONG SEVERAL NATIVE WOMEN TO RUN THIS RACE. AND SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG PUSH FOR LIKE VISIBILITY OF OUR NATIVE WOMEN. IN 2018, VOELKER FOUNDED NATIVE WOMEN RUNNING, A GROUP DEDICATED TO INCREASING VISIBILITY FOR NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN, SOMETHING SHE FELT WAS LACKING. THE GROUP NOW BOASTS MORE THAN 30,000 FOLLOWERS ON INSTAGRAM. AND THERE SHE IS THE DAY BEFORE THE RACE WITH HER NATIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE PARADE OF NATIONS. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CONVERGING CENTRAL PARK TO CELEBRATE. WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ? HAVE THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY NOT JUST FOR NATIVE PEOPLE, BUT FOR WOMEN ESPECIALLY? IT CREATES A PLACE OF POSITIVITY AND JUST A SISTERHOOD AMONG THESE WOMEN HAVE NEVER MET EACH OTHER AND ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER THROUGH LIKE INSTAGRAM. >> AS WE WALKED WITH VERNA THROUGH CENTRAL PARK, FINAL PREPARATIONS, THE RACE WERE WELL UNDERWAY. >> I ALWAYS IMAGINE HOW MY PARENTS BOTH PASSED, PASSING AWAY THAT WHEN MY RUN GETS HARD, I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THEM AT MY RACES THAT THEY'RE TELLING ME IN MY LANGUAGE. YAGO, YAGO WHICH MEANS AND NAVAJO, LIKE, KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING. GREAT. HERE IS THE FINISH LINE. WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK SEEING THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON FINISH LINE? OH, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S EMOTIONAL. YEAH. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I THINK YOU'RE JUST THINKING ABOUT LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE. YOU KNOW, MARVELING AT THE FINISH LINE. >> VERNON'S JOURNEY TO THIS ICONIC STRETCH BEGAN BACK IN 2009. >> DURING THE TIME I HAD THREE LITTLE BOYS, AND I WAS TAKING CARE OF EVERYBODY. AND WASN'T TAKING CARE OF MYSELF. AND I LIVED IN MINNEAPOLIS, AND I JUST STARTED. BUT THEN I SIGNED UP FOR A RACE THAT AUGUST OF 2009, WHICH WAS A HALF MARATHON. AND AS I RAN THAT HALF MARATHON AND I FINISHED, I THINK THAT WAS THAT WAS WHEN IT HIT ME. WHEN IT HIT YOU, WHEN YOU GOT THE BUG. WHEN I GOT THE BUG. AND I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, DURING THAT TIME, I WAS TRYING GET HEALTHIER AND I JUST THOUGHT, WOW, I CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS. >> THAT'S GOING TO IT. 14 YEARS LATER RACE DAY IN NEW YORK CITY. AND THERE'S VERNA WEARING A TRADITIONAL SKIRT PAIRED WITH A NATIVE WOMEN RUNNING SHIRT. AND LASTLY, A LAYER OF DETERMINATION. >> SHE TELLS US POUNDING THE PAVEMENT HAS BECOME A WAY FOR HER TO CONNECT TO HERSELF, HER HERITAGE AND TO HEAL. FOR NATIVE PEOPLE, RUNNING IS VERY SPIRITUAL. I THINK NOW RUN FOR HEALING. I RUN IN HONOR OF MY SIBLINGS. I'VE LOST THREE SIBLINGS AND I'VE LOST MY PARENTS. AND SO I THINK FOR ME, IT'S A TIME OF LIKE BEING ALONE ON THE TRAILS OUT WHEREVER I'M RUNNING AND JUST KIND OF GRIEVING AND, HEALING FROM LOSS. AND I THINK AFTER THAT RUN, IT'S ALWAYS LIKE POWERFUL. AND JUST KNOWING THAT THEY'RE THERE, EVEN THEY'RE NOT HERE PHYSICALLY, THEY'RE THERE WATCHING DURING THE MARATHON A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH AS, VERNA CROSSES THE FINISH LINE WITH THAT BIG SMILE AND FINALLY THE MEDAL DE FRANCE. >> VERNA SAYS THE CHEERS ARE WHAT PUSHED HER FORWARD EVEN WHEN THE GOING GOT ROUGH. >> I NEED TO JUST EMBRACE EVERY MINUTE, EVERY SOUND LIKE. AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I CANNOT GET OVER HOW INCREDIBLE AND ALL I WAS OF THE SPECTATORS THERE SHOWING UP FOR US. >> AND THAT'S ALL I ASK. AND THAT'S WHAT KEEPS HER GOING. THE THOUGHT OF BRINGING MORE NATIVE WOMEN ALONG WITH HER ONE STEP AT A TIME, RUNNING TOWARD THE SUN. >> LOVE TO SEE BERNICE. SMILE. AND THAT IS OUR SHOW FOR THIS HOUR. I'M LINSEY LINSEY DAVIS.

SOME 900 EARTHQUAKES IN SOUTHERN ICELAND TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TREMORS. IT RATTLED THE REGION IN RECENT WEEKS AS THE COUNTRY BRACES FOR WHAT COULD BECOME A SIGNIFICANT VOLCANIC ERUPTION. ALMOST 4000 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED OVER THE WEEKEND AS AUTHORITIES FEAR THAT MOLTEN ROCK WOULD RISE TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND POTENTIALLY HIT A COASTAL TOWN. AND A GEOTHERMAL POWER STATION . PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN ARGENTINA DEBATED IN A HEATED TV. ALL THEY HAD ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL IN A GENERATION. THE ELECTION, A LIBERTARIAN ECONOMIST PROPOSING TO DOLLARIZED THE ECONOMY AND STATE SPENDING AGAINST A PERONIST WHO HAS DOMINATED FOR DECADES BUT IS BEING BLAMED FOR A TRIPLE DIGIT INFLATION AND LOOMING RECESSION. THE WINNER WILL TAKE OFFICE ON DECEMBER 10TH. ANALYSTS BY THEN, INFLATION COULD HIT 180%. HINDUS WHO WANT THEIR WISHES TO COME TRUE WERE TRAMPLED BY A HERD OF VILLAGE COWS IN A RITUAL HELD EVERY YEAR ON THE DAY AFTER DIWALI. THE FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS, IN THE LARGEST OF CENTRAL INDIA. LOCALS SAY THOSE WHO TAKE PART ARE NEVER INJURED AS THE CATTLE, SOME RELUCTANTLY, MAKE THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PEOPLE IN THEIR PATH. COWS ARE REVERED AND CONSIDERED SACRED IN HINDU INDIA, WHERE IT'S CELEBRATED FOR ITS ABILITY TO NURTURE HUMANITY. >> IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ASSASSINATION OF JOHN F KENNEDY, LYNDON B JOHNSON TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE INHERITING A COUNTRY IN MOURNING, A COUNTRY IN WAR AND A COUNTRY IN THE MIDST OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. BY HIS SIDE THROUGH IT ALL, HIS WIFE, LADY BIRD JOHNSON, AND IN A NEW ABC NEWS STUDIOS DOCUMENTARY, THE LADY BIRD DIARIES, WE HEAR HER NARRATE HER OWN LIFE. >> LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. IT ALL BEGAN, LYNDON JOHNSON AND JOHNSON JOHNSON JUST ARRIVED AND THEN AND I KNOW DOWN THE AVENUE IN ONE CAR, SUDDENLY THERE WAS A SHARP PRESS ALERT. THE PRESIDENT IS THERE. AND WE ARE JOINED NOW BY DIRECTOR DAWN PORTER. DAWN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK ON THE SHOW. JUST A REMARKABLE SET OF RECORDINGS GIVING US NEW PERSPECTIVE INTO THAT FROM HER PERSONAL VANTAGE POINT. YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH MORE THAN 123 HOURS OF RECORDINGS. SO WHAT WERE YOU WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT? >> WHAT MOVED YOU AS YOU WERE LISTENING? YOU KNOW I HAD DONE FILMS ABOUT BOBBY KENNEDY. I DONE FILMS ABOUT JOHN LEWIS. AND SO I WAS REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS TIME PERIOD. BUT IT WAS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY TO HER FIRST PERSON RECOUNTING OF THE THINGS THAT SHE. I MEAN, THIS WAS THE PERIOD OF VIETNAM. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. ASSASSINATED. BOBBY KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED. SO TURMOIL WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. AND SHE WAS RECORDING EVERY DAY ,AS YOU SAID, 123 HOURS OF AUDIOTAPES AND CLEAR THAT SHE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE ISSUES. >> HOW MUCH OF A ROLE DID SHE ACTUALLY PLAY? YOU KNOW, THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT DISCOVERIES OF THIS FILM IS THAT LADYBIRD ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY INSTRUMENTAL IN WORKING WITH HUSBAND ON HIS POLICY DECISIONS. SO ONE THING THAT PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER IS THAT THERE WAS NO PLAN OF SUCCESSION IN THE UNITED STATES. SO WHEN KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED, JOHNSON HAD NO PRESIDENT. THAT PLAN OF SUCCESSION ACTUALLY HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION. THE CONGRESS REALIZED WE TO HAVE A PLAN IN CASE THE PRESIDENT WAS ASSASSINATED. AND THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD TO STEP UP. SO FOR THAT FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF HIS BEING OFFICE AS PRESIDENT, LYNDON JOHNSON HAD A KIND OF A REAL KITCHEN. AND LADY BIRD JOHNSON WAS WAS DEFINITELY INSTRUMENTALLY PART OF THAT. >> WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE TAPES ABOUT SOME OF THE PERSONAL TOOLS OF THE PRESIDENCY, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT THAT WE FOUND IS LYNDON JOHNSON SUFFERED FROM EXTREME DEPRESSION AND. LADY BIRD RECOUNTS THIS. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY PART THE REASON THAT SHE ASKED THAT THE TAPES BE EMBARGOED UNTIL UNTIL AFTER HER DEATH. BUT LYNNE LYNDON JOHNSON, MORE THAN ONE TIME THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT RESIGN THE PRESIDENCY. AND ONE TIME IN PARTICULAR, HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE AN ADDRESS TO THE NATION. AND LADY BIRD WRITES OUT HIS RESIGNATION SPEECH AND HE TAKES IT AND HE PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET AND NO ONE KNOWS. THERE'S ONLY THREE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT THIS IS POSSIBLY GOING TO THAT MAYBE LYNDON JOHNSON IS GOING TO RESIGN THE PRESIDENCY EVEN DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION. AND SO LADY BIRD IS RECORDING AS WELL. AND WE FOUND THAT THE FOOTAGE OF THE SPEECH AND SHE. IS HE GOING TO DO IT? IS HE GOING TO REACH INTO HIS POCKET? AND WHEN SEE THE FOOTAGE, YOU SEE THAT MOMENT WHERE HE HESITATES AND THEN HE DOESN'T SORT OF LIKE PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS FILM. >> I'D LIKE PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE DID FAR MORE THAN PLANT SOME FLOWERS. >> YOU KNOW, THAT IS WHAT SHE IS KNOWN FOR. IN FACT, SHE'S AN ENVIRONMENTALIST. LADY BIRDS RESEARCH LED TO MORE THAN 300 ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS BEING PASSED DURING THE JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION. IT ALSO IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE EPA. RICHARD NIXON INVITES LADY BIRD TO THE SIGNING OF THE LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING, THE EPA. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK IN THIS DAY AGE, WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT ROLE, WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE ROLE FOR THE FIRST LADY. YOU KNOW, DR. JILL BIDEN IS THE FIRST FIRST LADY WE'VE HAD WHO HAS OUTSIDE PAID. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I REALLY WAS THINKING A LOT. WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ACCEPTING WOMEN IN IN PUBLIC IN POLITICAL LIFE. DAWN PORTER, FASCINATING TOPICS THAT YOU'RE BRINGING TO LIFE. WE SO APPRECIATE. THE LADY BIRD DIARIES IS NOW STREAMING ON. >> AND STILL TO COME, WE'RE KICKING OFF A NEW SERIES CALLED ,THE AMERICAN CLASSROOM. OUR STEPHANIE RAMOS TAKES A LOOK AT HOW ONE ORGANIZATION IS HELPING VETERANS SEEK HIGHER EDUCATION. >> WHEN I GOT SENT TO IDAHO TO COVER THE MURDERS OF FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS, IT WAS A STORY THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR STUDENTS. STABBED TO DEATH IN THEIR BEDS WHILE TWO ROOMMATES WERE HOME. YOU GOT TO THINK TO YOURSELF, OKAY, HE'S THE TARGET. AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD A MAN GO THROUGH TO GET TO HIS TARGET.

acting president president of the Quorum of the 12 apostles for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints a close friend of President Ballard says he was able to visit with him briefly before his passing last night calling it a special moment he'll never forget Ariel Harrison joining us live now after exclusively speaking with that friend Ariel what was The Parting promise he made to president Ballard well first and foremost that man I spoke with is Ellis Ivory that Park the This Is The Place Heritage Park is incredibly special to that friendship because president M Russell n uh excuse me M Russell Ballard actually appointed um Ellis Ivory to be the director of the park so that's kind of where their connection um recently lies as the park but they've known each other for 50 years um and Ellis kind of dived into that history with me which was really incredible to be listening to today but um the promise that he shared uh with president Ballard as I know know they spoke recently was that he would continue to preserve the park it's something that's really important to president Ballard he values the Pioneer Heritage that Park brings I know that uh president Ballard is a direct descendant of the church founder Joseph Smith Jr uh for my understanding that is President Ballard's great great uncle his great great-grandfather is the brother of Joseph Smith Jr ham Smith and then further president Ballard's uh great-grandfather was the sixth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of latterday saints so some would say it's in his blood to serve in the capacity he did he served a very long time holding multiple callings and then assignments and served all over the world Brian pretty incredible it is incredible to to note the Legacy Ariel thank you and of course a lot of people mourning that loss today with President Ballard's passing there are now 11 Apostles so it could St that way until next April as Church leader it's president Russell M Nelson's job to fill the vacancy this traditionally happens during the Faith's General Conference the leadership group hasn't changed since Elder Garrett W gong and Elder ulyses Suarez were called back in April of 2018 Governor Spencer Cox remembering president Ballard tonight he posted these photos on X today saying president Ballard quote spent a lifetime of service trying to make the world a better place for everyone president Ballard was recently mentioned in new allegations in a lawsuit filed by several women against Tim Ballard and the nonprofit he founded oper operation Underground Railroad in an amended complaint attorneys for the women say president M Russell Ballard and other authorities from the church provided Mormon tithing records to Tim Ballard to help him Target wealthy donors and Wealthy Mormon church Wards now last week a church spokesperson released a statement saying quote The Church of Jesus Christ of latterday saints regards tithing records as sacred and keeps them confidential leaders ensure such information is not used for personal political or commercial purposes president Ballard has never released tithing records to OU or any other organization if you'd like to learn more about this lawsuit we have our past reports on our website right now which is kutv.com the University of Utah is releasing min minimal details about why they put gymnastics head coach Tom fan on paid administrative leave they said abuse allegations from some athletes did not play a role in this decision instead the you says acts by far and quote do not align with our values our Amanda Gilbert live at the University of Utah tonight Amanda very little put out by the university but what have you learned today yeah we've learned that that paid leave for coach Tom fan it's affected immediately again not a lot from the University though they did say that this is not related to student athlete welfare uh we're going to take a look at your screen here though we do know that associate head coach Cari dockendorf she is going to be serving as interim head coach she has been with the team since 2018 now this announcement comes just weeks after gymnast Cara akre posted to Instagram saying she was leaving the team leaving the school because of alleged abuse again the university um said that the decision this week is not because of student athlete welfare um but today I did speak with some students on campus to be honest a lot of students I ran into didn't know a lot um about all this they weren't super informed some did say though um that they had heard the news especially because Utah gymnastics team is uh pretty well known um but yeah I did spend a lot of the day Brian reaching out to the university reaching out to athletes former athletes students um a lot of people at this time though are saying no comment as this develops back to you Brian yeah Amanda no surprise on that obviously limited details put out but you're right I mean the red rocks and of course Utah gymnastics very prominent program um one that has a history of winning under coach Tom Fen and of course a lot of high-profile athletes on this program did any of them say anything on social media I know that's obviously where Cara AER put out her message a few weeks ago did was there any indication or reaction to the latest news there was Brian after Cara Acres Post another um former Utah gymnast actually shared her story on Instagram as well Kim tessin uh so some people did kind of speak up sharing their support um after Cara acr's initial post again I believe it was three weeks ago Amanda Gilbert on the University of Utah Campus tonight as we continue to try and learn more about why head coach Tom Fen of Utah gymnastics is now on paid administrative leave Amanda thank you over the past few months we've told you about the allegations and the emotional and verbal abuse coming from U ofu gymnasts this past summer a Kansas City based Law Firm investigated head coach Fen now the review found a lack of substantial evidence for rule violations however the law firm did find one instance in which fan violated the athletics department well-being policy as you just heard in October UT's gymnast Cara acre very well known was um part of Team USA as an alternate and such she was uh announcing that she left the team a few weeks ago citing emotional abuse that she said it took a toll on her physical mental and emotional well-being if you'd like to see more of our reporting on these allegations and interviews with former and current athletes you can find those on our website kutv.com and of course as we learn more about the status of head coach Tom fan we will share it with you there kutv.com all right let's talk about the lack thereof prip here this month very different from a year ago yeah I want to show you that that's like the big thing that jumps out remember how active November was now it wasn't that cold we had mainly Valley rain but we had a lot of Mountain snow that's why a lot of those ski resorts opened up early and the skiing was fantastic in the month of November last year at this time almost 2 Ines of water which is a lot of water here in Salt Lake City compared to so far just over a quarter inch normal is about a half inch so yeah we're just below normal we got to see this number go up and it's going to go up later this week we have a few storms coming in but nothing too cold at the moment and it's been very mild today so let's get to your forecast we did make it into the 60s here in Northern Utah and very close to 70 down in St George and speaking of St George we haven't had rain in 41 days so we've had a little bit of rain in Northern Utah but not down in southern Utah 41 in a row and the last time it did rain was October 3rd and we only got 01 so definitely need some moisture down in southern Utah and a little bit of rain is in your forecast as well but right now nothing looks too significant but that could change we have a few lingering clouds for tonight but temperatures will be cool but not that cold we'll see overnight loads in the upper 20s in Central Utah mid-30s here along the wasach front tomorrow more Sunshine we might have a couple high clouds rolling into Southwestern Utah but looks really Pleasant to be outdoors and get some yard work done we're going to be in the mid-60s here in Northern Utah even up in Park City and Southwestern Wyoming Northeastern Utah temperatures well into the 50s and St George might make it into the 70s tomorrow now there's a big big storm out in the Pacific which is good news but it's going to take some time and it's also going to be weakening as it gets closer to Utah but it's going to uh bring in a little bit of rainfall towards Wednesday night and Thursday and that's what we're watching the potential for uh in the meantime though at least for tomorrow and most of the day on Wednesday it looks quiet now it will be sunny on Tuesday there's the rain impacting California more clouds begin to roll in on Wednesday but we're still dry through 4:00 now as we head into Wednesday night you'll see some scattered showers quickly race through southern Utah into Central and Northern Utah overnight and into Thursday morning and then we'll have these Hit or Miss showers especially Thursday morning in Northern and Central Utah there will be a little bit of snow in the mountains but I'm not seeing a whole lot snow levels will be pretty high this is not a cold storm uh so snow levels right now could only drop to maybe 8,000 ft uh when it comes to rainfall amounts doesn't look like we'll get a ton I think generally about a tenth of an inch to a quarter inch of rain but some areas might locally see some higher amounts now the storm is still out in the Pacific on Thursday it's a little wave that kind of moves out of it that brings in that moisture eventually the whole thing begins to roll in over the weekend and it might meet up with some colder air but by the end of the weekend something that we're watching that could bring some rain and maybe some snow mixing in especially for Northern and Central Utah and then high pressure could be sliding in as we head into the following week so we're watching a few storms out there enjoy the warm weather because it's eventually going to get colder uh 70s in St George through Wednesday we're going to be in the upper 60s Thursday Friday Friday and get a chance for rain in St George Thursday and Saturday overnight lows staying in the 40s Salt Lake sunny tomorrow turns partly cloudy on Wednesday mid 60s but even with that rain on Thursday temperatures don't drop very much right around 60 we'll cool off into the 50s though by the end of the week and as we head into the weekend might see some stray showers on Saturday and then rain and snow possible by Sunday and then it doely gets colder for next week and that's Thanksgiving week we're talking highs back into the 4 you were supposed to say a foot of snow is coming out ala you know a photoo might come to Ala if you combine Thursday and Sunday okay that's good I think so yeah I mean it's um so meteorologist Trent Parker is just jonesing to get out like I mean hiking uphill policy following the policy to the tea okay but he's just in there and I'm I'm concerned for his well-being because there's not a lot of cover up there there isn't and of course because there's not a lot of cover ala postponed their opening day I know well they're smart about that obviously because there's a need for the natural stuff you can make stuff but like I don't think they want to do the one run right I think they want to open up a little bit more um I know that the Stoke is really high though because a lot of places are still at this point it looks like planning to open this week they're planning we'll see I mean they're not again they're probably going to be one or two runs open but we need another one to two feet to get more terrain all right so well we'll see what happens later this week obviously I know you're keeping an eye on it so thanks for watching this Monday installment of two news live love to have you with us here each and every day day Monday through Friday at 5:30 we're back again tomorrow with some more in-depth unique conversations on those topics that we've been following here at two news so have a great rest of your Monday night we're back tomorrow and uh hopefully maybe those snow total predictions will climb a little bit I'm just trying to I'm just trying to coach that Sunday storm where we're going to be watching it all righty see you tomorrow", "aigc_title": "News Highlights: Passing of LDS Church President, University of Utah Coach on Leave, and Upcoming Events",

are good afternoon everyone after so I have one thing at the stop at the top before I turn it over uh to Our Guest so I want to start out by noting that this week we celebrate two years since President Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure law in that short time this Administration has made historic progress in rebuilding America from breaking ground on major projects to rebuild our roads and bridges to delivering clean and clean and safer Safe Water to communities Across the Nation to cleaning up Legacy pollution expanding access to high-speed internet and building a clean energy economy here in the United States that supports good paying jobs so far the bipartisan infrastructure law has enabled us to launch 40,000 infrastructure projects and award in 4,500 communities across the country this historic investment in America has allowed up to more than 21 million low income come the households with access to free or discounted high-speed internet service through the affordable connectivity program that's what it's been able to provide those to 21 million low-income households start improvements on hundreds of thousands of miles of roads and thousands of bridge repairs help purchase more than 3,000 clean transit buses doubling their number on America's roadways as well as 2,400 clean school buses launch 2,300 projects to help community commities build resilience to threats such as the impacts of climate change and cyber attacks and that is not all the bipartisan infrastructure law and the entirety of the president's investing in America agenda has spurred more than 614 billion dollars in additional private sector manufacturing and clean energy Investments since President Biden took office not taxpayer dollars private sector Investments That is bolstering the president's work to create millions of good paying jobs including a record high number of jobs in the construction SE sector that's exactly what bionomics is all about investing in America and in American workers to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up and with that uh we have Jake Sullivan here our national security adviser to talk through the president's trip to uh San Francisco uh this week and also the bilet that you all are going to see uh later today with President Widodo and take any other uh foreign policy questions that you all we have thank you Karine and thanks everybody it's uh obviously an extremely busy time so I apologize my opening comments are going to be a little bit longer than usual but if you bear with me I'll be able to answer whatever questions you have today President Biden kicks off a significant week of highlevel diplomacy that will showcase the breadth of America's strategic and economic engagement in the world and the value we place on deepening our alliances and Partnerships this afternoon in fact very shortly President Biden will host president Joko woto of Indonesia on the cusp of celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations between the United States and Indonesia our two countries will announce the elevation of our bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership a new chapter that will drive Innovation and prosperity and cooperation for both of our countries President Biden and president woto will have the opportunity to discuss a range of key issues including the clean energy transition critical minerals and deepening our security and defense cooperation on Wednesday as you have heard President Biden and president XI will meet in the Bay area for a summit we anticipate that the leaders will discuss some of the most fundamental elements of the US PRC bilateral relationship including the continued importance of strengthening open lines of communication and managing competition responsibly so that it does not Veer into conflict the way we achieve that is through intense diplomacy that's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises that's how we work together where and when our interests overlap and deliver on key priorities for the American people and that's why in recent months I've had the opportunity to meet with director Wong y three times and it's why our secretaries of State Treasury and commerce all went to Beijing it's also why China for its part sent its vice president its foreign minister and other senior officials here to the United States in recent months President Biden comes into this Summit on a solid footing given the ways in which he has positioned the United States to be able to compete effectively both at home and around the world at home we've had the strongest recovery and lowest inflation of any leading economy we've created 14 million jobs more jobs in two years than any president in a four-year term and we've had 21 straight months of unemployment under 4% for the first time in half a century abroad President Biden has deepened our alliances and Partnerships in just the last year he's hosted the leaders from Japan the r the Philippines India and Australia for bilateral meetings here in Washington he formally launched Aus he held a historic trilateral Summit with the r and Japan at Camp David he upgraded our relations with Vietnam on a historic trip to Hanoi and he's hosted two Summits at the White House for Pacific island leaders as well as a special us Aion Summit finally at President Biden's Direction we've taken important steps to protect our national security we've put in place new rules on outbound investment and updated our export controls on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment and we've continued to uphold freedom of navigation in the region by flying sailing and operating wherever international law allows we're also looking for specific outcomes from the meeting on November 15th I won't get too far ahead of the meeting and I'll let the president speak for himself after he has the chance to meet with President XI but we believe that there are areas where our interests overlap like our efforts to combat the illicit fentanyl trade there are also areas where we can more effectively manage competition for example by reestablishing military to military Communications and there are of course critical Global issues that the two leaders will need to discuss including uh Russia's war against Ukraine and the evolving crisis in the Middle East all in all we're looking forward to a productive meeting President Biden has a long history with President shei their conversations are direct they're straightforward and President Biden believes that there is no substitute for leader to leer face to-face diplomacy to manage this complex relationship between the United States and China of course this week President Biden will this coming week will be doing a lot more than just meeting with President XI he'll be welcoming leaders from across the Asia Pacific for Apec economic leaders week at a moment when the most dynamic economic region in the world is looking to the United States as the leading economy in the world while in San Francisco you'll see President Biden put forward his economic vision for the region he will speak about how the United States is the preeminent driver of inclusive sustainable economic growth in the Asia Pacific and how the Asia Pacific is critical to growth here at home you'll see the president join leaders from across the region to announce in record time clear outcomes on a number of pillars of the indopacific economic framework you'll see him hosting a partnership for Global infrastructure and investment PGI event with major CEOs and ipf governments that will demonstrate how we are identifying new ways of working with the US private sector to drive high standard investment in the Indo Pacific in infrastructure in Innovation and other areas to unlock sustainable long-term growth and we're also hosting an event with major foreign CEOs focused on how President Biden's economic policies combined with our strong partnership with asia-pacific economies are driving historic and outsize Investments here in the United States in critical and emerging Technologies and in other areas and creating good paying jobs for American workers finally before I take questions I want to give a brief update on the Middle East the United States continues to work ground the clock to support efforts to rescue and reunite hostages held by Hamas with their families where they belong this includes many young children one of whom is a three-year-old American citizen toddler whose parents were tragically killed by Hamas on October 7th this is a top priority for President Biden for vice president Harris for secretary blinkin for me personally we have all spoken with families of US citizens who are being held hostage by Hamas and have raised this issue with all of our counterparts this remains a Paramount priority for us just yesterday President Biden spoke with the Amir of cutter to discuss the important efforts and the important negotiations ongoing to try to secure the release of the hostages being held by Hamas and later today here at the White House I'll be meeting with some of the families of the Americans who are currently being held the United States has also been leading efforts to increase the flow of life-saving sustained humanitarian assistance food water medicine into Gaza while we've made some progress much more is urgently needed to alleviate suffering among the civilian population in Gaza we're glad to see Israel take an important step in this direction last week and we remain in active discussions with the Israeli government about the importance of tactical humanitarian pauses in the fighting to permit civilians to depart areas of active hostilities to increase the flow of Aid and to enable hostage releases we continue to have discussions at all levels including President Biden with prime minister Netanyahu to urge Israel to continue taking every possible measure to protect civilians the loss of a single innocent life is a tragedy whether it's a Palestinian civilian an Israeli civilian or anyone else and we grieve for every innocent who is lost at the same time we will continue to stand behind the proposition that Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and with Hamas as I've said you're dealing with an organization that has come out publicly since October 7th and said that it intends to commit another October 7th and another one and another one until Israel no longer exists you have a leading spokesman from Hamas saying that the objective of the organization is a permanent state of war with Israel that is the reality that Israel is confronting and it's a reality that would be unacceptable for any nation and with that I will be happy to take your questions yeah thanks Jake uh you said yesterday in the president said just now in the Oval Office that hospitals in Gaza need to be protected do you believe that the Israelis have received that message and have they had any response so first uh what the president has just said and what I've said is that we do not want to see firefights in hospitals we want to see patients protected we want to see hospitals protected we have spoken with the Israeli government about this and they have said they share that view that they do not want to see firefights in hospitals and you've heard from IDF spokespeople uh stating things along those lines the Israeli government has also told us that they are prepared to provide fuel to hospitals to ensure that they can continue to operate and that that for certain hospitals they actually have not been able to be in communication with the people who are actually running the hospital so that's something we will continue to work on but the position of the United States on this matter is clear hospitals should be protected hospitals should be able to run effectively so that Medical Care should be can be given to patients and finally to the ENT people need to be evacuated from One hospital to another hospital in order to ensure the continuation of care evacuation routes have to be safe and the Israeli government has told us as recently as today that there are and will continue to be evacuation routes for uh people leaving hospital compounds so these are positions that for us are straightforward they are clear we have a constructive discussion with the Israeli government on this and I believe that they have indicated they hold similar positions on these ISS issues now as for what happens on the ground you know in a given hour on a given day we can't react to every individual report we can simply continue to State our position and continue to consult with the Israeli government uh to ensure that they are doing their best to fulfill their stated position on this and then more broadly the US is now focused on two Wars one in the Middle East one in Ukraine what would it mean for this government and in particular uh foreign policy and the military if there were to be a government shut down come fr Friday night this would be a devastating blow first of all to our service members at a very human level because it would have an impact on uh the ability of our troops to and their families to get all of the benefits and services that they deserve for the service they are performing for our country second it would send a signal to the world that the United States cannot pull together on a bipartisan basis to sustain Government funding and to show a United face to the world uh at a moment where you see this turbulence around the world so we will do everything in our power uh to support Congress coming together around a measure that will fund the government and not have a shutdown occur at the end of this week the President also said there's an effort to use the pause to deal with the release of prisoners and it's being negotiated with Qatar could you amplify on that a little bit yes uh there have been ongoing discussions with the government of cutter and in fact President Biden as I mentioned in my opening statement spoke by telephone with the Amir of cutter yesterday cter has been talking to Hamas Israel has been talking to cter the United States has been talking to both Israel and cter in an effort uh to try to move forward these negotiations to a point where hostages can be released and reunited with their families we're not there yet but we are continuing to try to make progress on that day by day hour by hour and as I said before the president has no higher priority which is why he is personally engaged on this issue secondly on the trip itself what does the president plan to tell president X in terms of getting Iran to re in its proxy attacks on US forces in the Middle East well from our perspective the PRC should share the interest of every responsible country that deescalation rather than escalation in the broader Middle East should be the order of the day so President Biden will make the point to president XI that Iran acting in an escalatory destabilizing way that undermines uh stability across the broader Middle East is not in the interests of of the PRC or of any other responsib country and PRC of course has a relationship with Iran and it's capable if it chooses to of making those points directly to the Iranian government yeah um yesterday you to U Israeli intelligence this does the US have any independent intelligence that Hamas has military facilities of Bunker under P Aliva Hospital in Gaza well what I said yesterday is that I'm not in a position to comment on intelligence matters American intelligence matters I can't divulge that to you what I can tell you is that we see plenty of Open Source reporting about h use of hospitals and other civilian infrastructure to store weapons to house Fighters uh to engage in in forms of command and control but beyond that I'm not in a position to to speak specifically to a report about a specific hospital or a specific bunker and so when uh the President says that hospitals must be protected um what does the president what does the United States want to see done with ala Hospital in particular and the Hamas facilities that you now point to open source intelligence saying lie under it well your question points up the complex lexity of this conflict and the added burden that Israel is facing as it goes against murderous terrorists who continue to say their goal is the absolute destruction of the state of Israel you're dealing with a terrorist organization Hamas that takes civilian uh hostages including little children that uses civilians as human Shields that uses civilian infrastructure even hospitals in the most cynical way possible that is as fighting positions as uh military operation centers and so Israel has to confront that well at the same time not wanting to go assaulting hospitals in firefights that could put innocent people who are getting life-saving Medical Care in the crossfire so there are not easy answers to this question but this is the complexity this is the burden that the Israeli Defense Forces are facing as they uh conduct their operations and our position is that Israel has the right to go after Hamas but it does face this added burden and that burden does not lessen its responsibility to act according according to the laws of war and so how that plays out in a particular operational Dynamic this tunnel or that bunker ultimately those decisions lie with the the military fighting the United States can't dictate that but we will continue to stand for the principle that the laws of war must be respected even as Israel goes after Hamas and the tools and infrastructure of its terrorism yeah do you have any proof of Life on hostages especially the Americans in the negotiations that have been going on has there been anything that could reassure the negotiators the president and you that hostages remain alive and potentially could be rescued so we have been very transparent about the fact that we have limited visibility into both the whereabouts of the hostages within Gaza and their condition and and I said as recently as yesterday that we have nine missing Americans one missing green card holder and I cannot look in the eye and tell you how many of those hostages are still alive we do have have information and I'll be careful about how I characterize that um about some of the hostages and and and a notion that there are a substantial number of hostages who are not just alive but who could potentially be part of a hostage release but I couldn't give you a number of exactly how many Americans would be included in that that's something that we will have to work through as we continue these negotiations and of course we won't know for certain until we we actually get the release of those hostages and their safely return to their families so that's something we're going to continue to work on uh thanks uh I want to ask about the house spending proposal does not include money for National Security priorities uh that the Administration has uh Israel Ukraine particularly Ukraine uh what are the next steps for getting funding if if this spending proposal is not an option so I will leave it to Karen to kind of talk about the Congressional Dynamics and particular measures that have been put forward in the house what I will say is that the the president the Biden Administration put forward a funding request for Israel for Ukraine for the indopacific and for the Border uh we detailed exactly what we needed including for Ukraine and we still need that and we need it as soon as we can get it and we are working actively with both the house and the Senate both Republicans and Democrats to secure the votes and to get the vote to get that funding and I continue to remain confident that while this has been a Winding Road since we began the effort to secure additional funding for Ukraine that there is a strong bipartisan majority in both houses to do it and we will ultimately get it done how exactly through what vehicle and what measure that's something that I will defer to the legislative experts on I will only say that we are continuing to make the case actively I'm on the phone personally daily with members both Democrats and Republicans to make the case and we are leaning forward in making it clear that the United States national interest will be deeply harmed if we are not able to secure and sustain funding for Israel Ukraine the indopacific and the border and if I may ask about the trip please um what what is the president's message going to be regarding taiwan's upcoming elections will the will the president warn president she directly for example against interfering in the elections I I'm not going to preview what exactly President Biden will say to president pres she because I think he should have the opportunity to speak to him directly in person without me proclaiming it from the podium I will say that the president broadly speaking is going to set out um a vision for peace and stability and the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan straight and he will do that in his meeting with President she but in terms of the specifics of that conversation I will leave that to the president to do person a person face to face yeah thank you Jake how confident is the US that the US and China can restore military to military Communications it's now been more than a year since China suspended those talks so what are the main sticking points from the Chinese side I'll defer to well not defer to refer to China on the sticking points because ultimately they'll have to answer that for themselves the United States has been ready for that entire period to sustain military to military Communications because we think it's the only responsible thing to do having our two militaries in communication is the way you reduce mistake you avoid escalation you manage competition so it doesn't beer into conflict that to us is an absolutely straightforward factor and no matter what else is happening in the relationship those military to military links should remain intact that's our position going into San Francisco we believe that uh the PRC has been constructive in the dialogue we've been having with them on this issue uh we will see what happens in San Francisco and the president will be able to report after the meeting whether in fact we've made progress on restoring military to military links what's your assessment for why the Chinese has been willing to engage so much more in recent months how much of it has to do with China's economic struggles and if that's the case how can you be sure that what comes out of Apec is long lasting and not just tactical from the Chinese side well look I'm not going to speculate as to what China's motives are again that's a question you should pose to them and and they can lay it out for you I do think your question raises an important point though which is nothing stands still in the world as we've just seen from the October 7th crisis and there will be you know inevita things that arise that are unanticipated there will be turbulence as there always is and the question is can we create the lines of communication and the broad parameters in the relationship so that through whatever comes we can manage competition responsi so it doesn't Veer into conflict that's what the president has set out to achieve in this Summit with President XI and so he sees this not just as a one-off meeting but as an important moment to be able to establish the kind of basis upon which we can proceed out into the future Jak you mentioned that you guys see this as an important meeting on Wednesday but I'm curious will the president during his time with the Chinese president try to hold China accountable for the Spy balloon this year I know obviously it seems like it was 20 years ago but it was this year the Chinese have said it was still a weather balloon they said they should get the technology back what kind of response are we going to see from the president this week on the spot well as I said before I'm going to let the president be able to sit down with President XI and speak to him personto person face to face and again not be doing diplomacy from the podium and we can report to you afterwards consistent with whatever um you know is appropriate to share publicly on these issues but I will say that uh President Biden took steps to uh take down that balloon once it was safe to do so and out of potential Harm's Way to civilians we were able to recover it to exploit it and from our perspective the critical thing is that uh because we were able to protect ourselves along the way of that path we do not feel that there was any information gain that was problematic and so the United States the president is going to focus at this point on how he stands up for and protects American interests going forward across the full range of challenges in this relationship of which this is one do you want CH to apologize again I'm going to let President Biden speak to president XI I'm not going to stand here from the podium and and kind of create threats or questions or make particular demands because I think that will not be the most effective way to secure the Diplomatic outcomes the American people are looking for Jake how would you rate relations between the US and China since President Biden's meeting with President XI last year and what would you say that the US has been able to achieve in the relationship as a direct result of their last meeting well first the most important thing is that this is a complex relationship a competitive relationship that could easily Veer into conflict or confrontation if it's not well managed and so managing the relationship in an effective way is the single most important responsibility of the president and everyone who works for him on this file and then beyond that the US and China have to be able to speak directly to one another on all of the critical issues that face our two countries including issues uh in moments of Crisis like the Russia Ukraine crisis and president Biden has had a number of candid conversations with President XI about the question of Military Support to the Russian Federation in the conduct of its war in Ukraine President Biden has had the opportunity to engage and so have the rest of us on how we effectively manage peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait so that we can sustain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait so those are some of the issues that through intense diplomacy we have been able to manage intense competition and then we will look for opportunities to actually generate affirmative outcomes that deliver tangible progress for the American people in areas where our interest overlap I mentioned for example the issue of fentanyl we're hoping to see some progress on that issue this coming week and that could then open the door to further cooperation on other issues where we aren't just managing things but we're actually delivering uh tangible results we'll continue to work at that as we go forward yeah the us yesterday launched its third round of strikes against facilities tied to Iran that were in in Syria I mean you've said that this is in part to try to deter other attacks against um US service members but in the hours since that attack at least four times US forces were hit uh in an attack so how is this a success if these incidents keep happening over and over our goal over time is to ensure that our forces are protected and that we respond if we get hit that is what we have done that is what we will continue to do and this should be measured over the course of time not over the course of 24 hours now if Iranian proxies continue to strike American forces we will continue to respond President Biden has been straightforward about that we have followed through on that we will continue to follow through on that because the president's view is ultimately he has got to look out and Safeguard the security and the physical safety of all of our forces in both Iraq and Syria we're going to continue to do that and we have made clear that if we continue to get hit we will respond yeah a timeline for when the current funding to Ukraine is going to run out so I mean there's not a literal day on the clock but each week that passes our ability to fully fund what we feel is necessary to give Ukraine the tools and capacities it needs to both defend its territory and to continue to make advances that gets harder and harder so for us the window is closing but I cannot point to a date on the calendar because of course this is a dynamic situation and we have to make decisions about draw down packages how we size them what gets sent based on our assessment of the calendar of when we're actually going to get a bill passed so I can tell you it is already having an effect on our ability uh to give Ukraine everything that it needs and that effect will only compound over time we are still able to supply uh the military assistance uh that Ukraine has been asking for but if we got the full funding we could do so on a much more certain consistent basis and that's what we're looking for and there a report that President Biden and president CH are going to agree to a ban on the use of artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons are you able to confirm that or AI will be a part of your discussion at all of course AI will be part of the discussion but I cannot confirm that report I saw it this morning and I'm not exactly sure where it came from yeah thanks a lot Jake what's your level of confidence that China has not provided to Russia any military equipment or munitions or technology uh as it relates to Russia's war against Ukraine our latest assessment is that Russia excuse me China has not provided weapons to Russia as part of the war in Ukraine uh but I will come back to you to confirm that remains our latest assessment as of today because my information is a few days old and then on Gaza if I may uh what's your satisfaction level as it relates to what was announced last week this humanitarian pause would you like to see longer pauses Beyond Just 4 hours a day uh do you expect that to happen well first I think there are circumstances where more than four hours a day is going to be necessary and in fact the Israeli government has recognized that they've extended some of these pauses to 7 hours for example to create the corridor so that people can move around safely We Believe pauses should not be dictated by a strict timetable they should be dictated by what is necessary to achieve the objectives and those objectives are safe passage uh the ability to move around humanitarian Aid and then ultimately we'd like to see considerably longer pauses days not hours uh in the context of a hostage release and that's being actively worked on as well yeah um on the five Army special ops horses that were killed in a helicopter crash in the Mediterranean over the weekend because they were there as part of the force buildup because of what's happening in Israel would you consider their deaths American casualties of that war I would not uh I would refer you to DOD For What the formal assessment would be but I would tell you just as a straightforward matter we have forces deployed around the world in every theater and tragically these training accidents do occur this accident did not occur in combat it occurred during a training Mission and so uh that's why from my perspective it would not be from this war yeah thank you Jake I have two questions on Gaza um 100 stuff at the state department and usid accused the Biden administration of spreading misinformation the Israeli newspaper said actually some of the Israelis were killed were killed by Israeli Army on October 7th and the number is 1,200 not, 1400 that's not taken away from um what happened on October 7th but you were adamant that you do not trust the Palestinian sources when it comes to casualties so accurate information is vital especially in fighting anti-Semitism and islamophobia so does the white have a credibility when it comes to um information and accurate information can we rely on you when you at the podium and tell us certain information and St when I know information I will tell it to you when I don't know information I'm not certain about it as earlier in this uh discussion when we were talking about the number of American hostages who are still alive those who may have been actually killed by Hamas I will tell that to you if we get new information that supersedes the information we have before I will tell that to you and we have a track record from day one of this Administration to do all of those things we will continue to do that every day and I categorically reject the notion that we are pedaling any misinformation yeah thanks you said today uh as you said a number of times about the importance of the laws of war being upheld um Israel has killed around 11,000 Palestinians around 2/3 of those are women and children uh the situation in the hospitals is there Israel has dropped an astronomical amount of uh ordinance and very built up areas is Israel in your view abiding by the laws of war and if it is how you come to that conclusion well as I said yesterday I Jake Sullivan standing here am not in a position to be judge and jury to make that determination it's a legal determination what I can do is state for you the clear policy of the Biden Administration which we have been unequivocal about from the beginning of this conflict and that is that even though Hamas is using civilians human Shields is burrowing into civilian areas with its rocket and placements that they are continuing to launch every single day at civilian areas in Israel that puts an added burden on the IDF but it does not lessen their responsibility to act in ways that separate terrorists from civilians and does everything in their power to protect civilian lives that is that was the case that remains the case today that is the message that we've said publicly and we communicate to our Israeli counterparts privately and we do that on a daily basis just tring to be clear the administration's view is that the IDF is doing that what I told you is that I am not in a position to give you a legal determination to your question I am not in a position to do that what I'm in a position to do is to State the US government position on how Israeli operation should be conducted and that is what I have done that is what I continue to do that is what I can do from this Podium yeah thank Jake did Governor Gavin new give the White House a heads up on his meeting with President she and have you guys gotten a readout from his team since and what did you make of all that we we had a heads up we got a readout in fact Ambassador Nick Burns accompanied that delegation on that meeting so it was fully coordinated between the governor's office and and the US state department um of course I won't get into the details of that because uh those were private diplomatic conversations but we've had a good opportunity to get a download as we have from Senator Schumer's bipartisan delegation and Senator Schumer and I actually just spoke today about some of the outcomes of that conversation which are feeding into work the president will do this week and hopefully help result in some tangible progress yeah thank you so much uh do you intend at some stage to provide more details about the kind of military equipment Israel is getting from the United States and the way it's using it uh yes the Department of Defense will lay out what we are providing to Israel I've stood up here before and told you about some of the key elements of that which have included interceptors for Iron Dome artillery ammunition Precision guide ammunitions um and so the dod and the state department will follow normal protocol in laying out the sales and transfers of weapons to Israel yeah thank you Jake I have a question on your meeting with yac but first on the bat as I understand president wi Doo will be bringing the resolution from the organization of Islamic cooperation which includes uh demand for immediate ceasefire and rejection of Israel's justification that it's actions in Gaza is self-defense so clearly on the international stage President Biden is losing ground on this issue we see this at the UN every day my question is is he ever at all concerned that he may be on the wrong side of History here and how does he plan to engage with President Widodo on this issue President Biden uh is looking forward to engaging with President Widodo across the full range of issues in the bilateral relationship and Regional and Global issues on many issues they will agree wholeheartedly in fact they'll make significant progress on other issues they will have different perspectives president wot's position on the conflict in Gaza is well known so is President Biden they'll both have the opportunity to respectfully exchange views on that issue they will also have the opportunity to elevate the US Indonesia bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership and to make tangible progress on issues like critical minerals like clean energy cooperation and like investment so you will see in this the the fullness of the relationship between the United States and Indonesia but also the robustness of that relationship and the way in which it is Advanced over the course of the past three years notwithstanding the fact that there are differences of perspective on certain aspects of the ongoing crisis yeah has cleaned up their streets ahead of President Biden and president she's meeting they've moved homeless to other parts of the city cleared tent cities and trash off the street is the president embarrassed that an American city needs to go through a total makeover to be presentable for his out of town guests the president is incredibly proud of the record that the United States will bring as host to this Summit and I went through some of it today the strongest economic record of any developed country the lowest unemployment over a sustained period in half a Century far-reaching Investments in innovation in ships uh rebuilding America's infrastructure so actually the Joe Biden thinks he is walking into the summit on the front foot and able to showcase the United States as the premier destination for investment good job creating investment here in the United States all of which will be on display while he is there and the countries of the world who are coming with a recognition that the United States is in a strong indeed for a lot of people an enviable economic position and that is going to I think sustain him very effectively through the course of the week but Governor gav said of the clean up this I know folks are saying oh they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming to town that's true does President Biden agree it's more important to impress the leader of China than the American people that live in San Francisco and pay taxes every day first I completely reject the premise of your question but secondly I don't know what the context of what governor Nome said so I I won't respond to it uh last question secretary linkoln said that were Hamas tunnels under schools hospitals and Mos does the US have Intelligence on this outside of what's in the public domain so I can't speak to intelligence matters as I've said before and I feel hamstrung by that because um obviously we have intelligence sources ourselves but I'm not in a position today to be able to share that intelligence and is it fair to say the conflict in the Middle East is now on at least three fronts Israel Hamas Israel Hezbollah and US Iranian proxies I think it's I I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a three fund conflict I would accept that there is an exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah there's an obvious ongoing military operation in Gaza and yes we have been struck repeatedly by proxy groups of the irgc in Iraq and Syria and we have responded those are all that is all correct thank you guys thank you so much Jake okay let's continue good the Supreme Court uh today unveiled the code of ethics uh on justices um there's been a lot of scrutiny of of Justice's of conflicts of interest um has the president have chance to review that does he have a position on it does he believe it goes far enough so um I'm not going to get uh add more to uh or go beyond what the president has said already in the prua interview that he shared when it re when we talked about um when he was asked about the Supreme Court ethics so there are ethics rules that apply to to other and lower lower federal courts obviously and so obviously the American people have the right uh to to expect um those who are serving in high office to meet High ethics and transparency obviously standards and so but I don't have beyond that I know the president has talked about this recently and then there's security incident overnight uh with uh with the secret service agent uh apparently fired a shot U and attempted uh car vehicle theft to Breaking of the Secret Service vehicle regarding one of the president's grandchildren um has the president been briefed on that incident and does he believe that sec service hand that appropriately so for any questions about uh security matters I would have to refer you to the Secret Service any questions again any questions referring to this I would have to oh I totally understand these this is personal information anything that deals with personal information I would refer you to the secret service especially as we're talking about uh security matters and lastly um Jake just said he felt hamstrung by his inability to releas um us intelligence assessments of Hamas activities um has the president given any consideration to potentially be classifying that uh that intelligence we've seen downgrades uh regarding all sorts of sensitive uh us collections in the Ukraine context U but has the president considered that in uh in regards to what Hamas is doing allegedly under these hospitals I just don't have anything to add to what Jake Sullivan our national security adviser shared today at the podium get Nancy thanks green um this year Auto thefts are way up carjackings are way up uh violent crime is way up here in DC a couple of members of Congress were attacked now this overnight How concerned is the president about the increase of crime in this city where so many government workers live so we are definitely concerned about what we're seeing and not just here across the country obviously and that's why the president's first uh first year in this Administration uh he made sure to get to pass to get P the American Rescue plan and he did that with Democrats and not one Republican vote and in that American Rescue plan there was a there was billions of dollars that were provided uh to local cities to make sure that they were able to hire police officers and make sure that they had they felt like they could have a safer and more effective uh accountability uh Community account policing accountability and that is why he took those actions last year as you know back in August of last year he he talked about his safer safer American America plan again trying to call on Congress uh to invest over $ 3.35 billion to fund uh police and fight crime and so the president has taken actions he would like to uh do this in a bipartisan way with Republicans on the other clearly uh uh uh in Congress and they haven't done that and they've used this as a political weapon as a political talking point while the president has taken action to make sure our communities are are safer are are we concerned obviously obviously we want to make sure Americans and their families feel safe in not just here in DC but across communities but we can't do this alone the president again has taken action he's with the American Rescue plan billions of dollars were able to go into States into communities so that they can they can provide um funding and police and police officers to make sure that their communities are safe but we need more we need Congress to act that's why he put forward the safer America plan $35 billion Congress can act what does the president need to know about this latter CR before rendering a judgment on it so we're going to let the negotiations uh continue uh we're going to be in close contact with Democrats in both the house and the Senate the leadership there and have make sure that they are having their conversations to see the best path forward for the American people and that's what the president spoke to I think there's he said there was going to a conversation happening later this afternoon or pretty much very soon and so we're just going to let that be um thanks Ken so the house plan includes no Aid to Israel or Ukraine is the White House still confident that their supplemental funding requests can pass on it own and what vehicles remain here for Ukraine funding so look um Jake spoke about this very well from here and talked about the importance of making sure that we continue to fund fund Ukraine making sure that uh we have funding for Israel as well uh I'm not going to get into legislative negotiations from here from the podium but look I'm going to be very clear lives are at stake right the the National Security uh um supplemental that we put forward is incredibly important it's important for our national security uh also let's not forget the domestic uh supplemental as well so it's important for our needs here our needs across across the globe and so look we're going to not negotiate from here but I think Jake laid it out very clearly the importance of continuing to fund Ukraine and the importance of uh the funding that we've asked for Israel you've called the latter CR unserious what deal would the White House you willing to accept given all the snakes you laid out so look I mean let's be very clear here I know there's been a lot of questions on on this and the supplemental um look House Republicans are threatening a government shutdown that's what we're seeing right now that uh would hurt our economy uh that would hurt our national security as I just spoke to and in September we saw this happen where House Republicans threatened to shut down the government unless uh they got their radical uh radical demands then they shut then they shut down Congress for three uh for three chaotic weeks as they try to figure out who their next speaker was going to be after ousting the last speaker and so look you know there's work to be done they have to get the work done they got to keep the government open and so negotiations are going to be happening Democrat we're going to continue to talk to Democratic Leadership on the house and the Senate and uh and uh and so that we can make sure that we're moving forward in a way that's that's best for the American people and as I stated the LA this latest proposal is very much untested it is it's untested and where they could have uh you know avoided this weeks ago but instead they were in their own chaos this is I'm speaking about the house of Republicans here and and so we're going to continue to have those conversation with Democratic Leadership is the president concerned that City crime could get this close to his family look I'm not going to uh speak to um speak to um uh the incident that's something for Secret Service to speak to not going to talk about it from here I spoke to uh the crime more broadly and what the president has done since almost day one of his administration starting with the his first piece of legislation that he signed into law with this which is the American Rescue plan bill ions of dollars going into cities going into states to make sure that they have the funding available to protect communities to hire police officers that's something that the president is concerned not just here uh in in the district but across the across the country as it relates to anything else uh I would have to refer you to Secret Service Nai Biden had been a resident here at the White House and I wonder when did that change that she would move to her own residence with her husband this is a personal matter this is personal information certainly not going to speak from it from from the podium I would have to refer you to the Secret Service one more thing president frequently talks about the fact that he speaks to his grandchildren every day do you know if he has spoken with Naomi Biden since this occurred I'm not going to get into private conversations that the president has with his family as he stated himself he is uh speaks his grandchildren regularly he's very close to his family I'm just not going to get into uh confirming conversations with his family okay follow quick question Kelly ask the White House considered having May Bowser back over here just to talk about crime in general I know she was here I think early when the president took office but I'm just curious any interest in maybe hearing from we are in regular conversations with mayor Bowser about an array of issues a range of issues that uh that is important to the residents here obviously in in Washington DC that is something that is continuous uh we have a an a uh intergovernmental Affairs office here and so we are in touch with her as mayor of DC but also other Mayors and governors across uh across the country um look I've said this moments ago and I'll say it again we've been very serious on dealing with uh the crime that we have seen just across the country and we'd love to work with Republicans on this they have not been serious on this uh the president again put forth the American Rescue plan signed that into law put billions of dollars into communities to help uh help Mayors and and uh and governors deal with crime in their city and their states but Republicans aren't serious he put forth the safe for America's plan $35 billion to continue to invest and make sure that we're actually dealing with this type of crime we don't hear anything from them so House Republicans more broadly in Congress if they want to get this done we're willing to work with them I'm going to keep going I'm going to keep going I'm going to keep I'm going to keep going theer is working but if Mone the Mone there thanks K meta platform said that it's going to require advertisers to disclose when artificial intelligence or other digital tools are used in Facebook or Instagram ads on social issues elections and politics I wanted to find out what President Biden thinks about that uh so don't have anything to share on their new policy uh meta's new policy obviously the president put forward a pretty comprehensive uh AI uh executive order recently uh and so outside of that I'm just not going to not going to really comment on private uh entities and and actions that they're taking but obviously the president takes this very seriously and you could see that with the comprehensive uh executive order that he put forward uh that touches on many uh many important uh many important parts of different Industries obviously the the goal here is to protect Americans could you speak more broadly about what the president thinks social media platforms should be doing within the next couple months to prepare for potential AI generated misinformation on their platforms especially going into an election season so I'm going to be very careful because you're asking me about election season don't want to speak to that from here uh obviously we take take this very seriously because we put forth an executive order very recently uh that is seen as being uh comprehensive that is seen as being transformative uh and that is something that we can do here from the federal government uh I'm just not going to talk to talk about private companies from here and what they're going to do in uh in the upcoming election thank you Ken I wanted to follow up on the twostep uh CR that Republicans are putting uh out you've previously said that this would be a recipe for chaos and more shut down I'm wondering what the president's message is to um those house Democrats who seem at least intrigued by this proposal for instance uh Minnesota representative Dean Phillips uh has said that speaker Johnson's twep CR quote isn't perfect but a whole lot better than a shutdown so look the latest proposal as I just said is definitely untested and that's true it is untested uh we are going to continue and this is something that the president was saying in the Oval Office just moments ago before we came came out to the uh into the briefing rooms we're going to be in touch with Democratic Leadership in both the house and the Senate and uh our goal our number one goal is to make sure that we move uh we take the best path forward uh for the American people that's what we're going to focus on but it is this is indeed untested uh and uh that is uh that is something that uh we're seeing coming from them and look this is something that they could avoid it and instead of avoiding where we are right now just a couple days away from a government shutdown they've wasted time they have wasted time so Democratic Leadership is going to have that conversation in both the house and the Senate on how to best the move forward there was there was an update I just wanted to the uh house oversight committee has now issued a subpoena for the former White House Council Dana Remis they're also asking for four other transcrip interviews with White House employees regarding the classified documents that were found in ropa or in Wilmington I'm just curious would the White House support cooperating with the committee's oversight specifically with the subpoena for Dana remas I'm just not going to comment from here which is consistent with what we've been doing from here go ahead thank you follow up on on Phil's question uh will the house Democrats uh know the president's position on whether or not he would sign that continuing resolution before they have to vote on it well the president literally just talked about this one of your colleagues asked uh asked him about this particular CR and he said that he wants to there there's going to be conversations on the negotiations on the hill and he wants to talk to uh the leadership and so that's in the Democratic House and Senate and that's what we're going to do don't have anything else to share I'm just going to go to the back go ahead in the back thanks fre uh some Democrats particularly in and around the squad have openly disagreed with the president for being too supportive of Israel there's also been some grassroot groups that backed the president and are now indicating that this could be a deal breaker for them is the president worried that this will continue to be a wedge issue within the party and why can't he get his fellow Democrats on the same page on this issue so look you know in our party there's going to be various range of agreements and disagreements and and that's the way it is right in in particular in the Democratic party the president's going to continue to be clear about this you heard it at the top uh when when uh Jake San was giving an update on the Middle East where the president stands the president has been very clear uh and uh when when it comes to Israel and what we saw on October 7th Israel has the right to defend itself they have the right to defend itself and so we're going to support Israel in doing that uh obviously there is the rule of law right that the that Jake talked about that we believe that should be followed and uh and uh you know we're going to continue to to be uh steadfast in what we believe and what how we see this moving forward and making sure we just talked about the supplemental the National Security Supplemental and making sure Israel has what its need Ukraine has what its need let's not forget they are dealing with terrorism and tyranny that's what they're dealing with they're dealing with an organization like Hamas who was a terrorist organization who had said and Jake talked about this a leader from the Hamas organization said that they would want to see in October 7th happen over and over and over and over again and that's what Israel is dealing with all right one last question go ahead we in the back thank you um President Biden and president she are expected to talk about combating elicit ventel what outcome is he looking for here in that talk well look I'm just going to say this I'm not going to get ahead of uh obviously that's going to be a discussion that they're going to have I'm going to let the president uh speak to that himself they're going to have that leader to leer conversation as Jake said moments ago and and the president will have more to share uh once he's has his meeting with President G can you just talk about the importance of addressing this issue oh it's critical it's important this is something that we've talked about and taken very seriously when it comes to fentol and getting that off our streets uh certainly uh we are we are certainly focused on making sure that we protect uh Americans and American family so obviously this is an important uh agenda item that the president wants to uh have to discuss this fentol getting taking getting that off our streets uh is C certainly a critical uh a critical um uh conversation that we need to continue to have and the president certainly has taken actions um on doing that all right thanks everybody we'll see you on the road", "aigc_title": "Behind the Scenes: Preparations
