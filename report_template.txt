Note: Final Total = Total Expected Positives + Total Expected Negatives

Key Not Found: A key was not found in the resultant dictionary (expect all names from input to be part of the result)
 * [+/-] determined by the original dictionary's result, counts towards recall

New Invented Key: A key was found in the resultant dictionary, but not the original
 * [+/-] determined by the resultant dictionary's result, counts towards precision

Note: 'Key Not Found' and 'New Invented Key' may appear at the same time due to to a typo (thus, a 'new key' was created and an old one is 'not found')
