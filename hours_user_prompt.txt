Given a list of weekly restaurant hours and some user inquiry including an exact date and time, determine whether each of the restaurants are open then.
While doing so, consider the following:
1. 'time': the actual date and time in the user inquiry
2. 'day_of_week': the exact day of the week that 'time' would be
3. 'opening_hours': the opening hours of the restaurants in 'day_of_week'
4. 'reasoning': your reasoning for everything in 'is_open'
5. 'is_open': a list of the names of the restaurants that are open in 'time', according to 'opening_hours'
Below are the data for the opening hours of restaurants, today's date, and the user question:
Opening Hours: {opening_hours}
Today is {today}
User Question: {user_prompt}
Please output in the following json format:
{{
    "time": "%Y-%m-%d %I:%M%p",
    "day_of_week": "%a",
    "opening_hours": {{
        "Restaurant Name 1": "%I:%M%p-%I:%M%p",
        "Restaurant Name 2": "%I:%M%p-%I:%M%p, %I:%M%p-%I:%M%p",
        "Restaurant Name 3": "Closed",
        ...
    }},
    "reasoning": {{
        "Restaurant Name 1": "Some reasoning whether it is open",
        ...
    }},
    "is_open": [
        "Open Restaurant Name 1",
        ...
    ]
}}
